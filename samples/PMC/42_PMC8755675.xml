            <p id="Par3">104 patients were enrolled; 52 were 6–11 years old, and 52 were 12–16 years old (mean age 11.6 years). The maximum tolerability score experienced by any patient was 1 (faint redness). Fourteen adverse events (none serious) in nine patients (8.7%) were considered possibly treatment-related. Reduction in pain during the study was somewhat greater for patients aged 6–11 versus 12–16 years (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.011). The diclofenac plasma concentration tended to be higher in the younger age group compared with older patients: 1.83 versus 1.46 ng/mL at the first assessment and 2.49 versus 1.11 ng/mL at the last assessment (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.002).</p>

          <title>Plain Language Summary</title>
          <p id="Par6">In this post-marketing clinical trial, the safety and efficacy at relieving pain of the FLECTOR diclofenac epolamine topical system (FDETS), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) formulation in a medicated patch, was assessed in a pediatric population (aged 6–16 years) with clinically significant minor soft tissue injuries. The safety and efficacy profiles in the pediatric population were consistent with previous data in adults. Both diclofenac plasma concentrations and reduction in pain during the study were greater for younger patients (aged 6–11 vs. 12–16 years), but plasma concentrations were much less than after diclofenac was taken orally in previous studies. This study shows that FDETS can safely and effectively provide pain relief for soft tissue injuries in children, with minimal systemic NSAID exposure and a low potential risk of either local or systemic adverse events.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p id="Par7">Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective in a variety of acute and chronic pain conditions, including osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and systematic reviews of randomized, double-blind, comparative studies have shown topical diclofenac to be effective for acute and chronic pain, including strains and sprains, with low rates of systemic or local adverse events (AEs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The use of topical systems (formerly known as patches) for the administration of NSAIDs has several key advantages, including drug delivery directly to the injury site, markedly reduced plasma concentrations relative to systemic formulations, lower risk of systemic AEs, and avoidance of first-pass metabolism and potential drug-drug interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, topical systems provide a route of administration for patients who are unable to take oral medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and, of the various topical preparations of diclofenac, diclofenac patches are associated with lower rates of application site AEs than when formulated as gels or topical solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Diclofenac as an epolamine salt is available as the topical formulation, FLECTOR diclofenac epolamine topical system (FDETS). The FDETS consists of an adhesive material containing 1.3% (180 mg) of active ingredient (diclofenac epolamine) to be directly applied to the painful area up to twice a day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Each 10 × 14 cm FDETS releases diclofenac epolamine from a non-woven polyester felt backing. The adhesive side of FDETS is covered by a polypropylene film-release liner, which is removed before application.</p>
        <p id="Par8">FDETS is indicated for the treatment of acute pain due to minor strains, sprains and contusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Studies in adults with minor soft tissue injuries—including sports injuries and back pain—treated with FDETS have shown rapid and effective pain relief, with a low frequency of AEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Post hoc analysis of data from two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 274) in adult patients with acute ankle sprain showed that the diclofenac epolamine 1.3% topical patch resulted in clinically important pain reduction within approximately 3–4 h (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05 vs. placebo), with pain relief occurring as early as 1.27 h after application, compared with 3.76 h for the placebo patch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, a review of previously unpublished clinical and pharmacokinetic data supported the efficacy of FDETS in providing relevant clinical pain relief through local accumulation of diclofenac in the target site, without evidence of systemic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. More specifically, in a pediatric population, no topical or systemic AEs were reported when retrospective data from 176 children and adolescents aged 8–15 years with acute sports-related trauma injuries not severe enough to warrant surgical intervention or immobilization treated with FDETS one plaster twice daily for 3–14 (commonly 7) days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
        <p id="Par9">While FDETS is approved for use in adults, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires a phase IV trial to be conducted to confirm the safety and efficacy of FDETS in a pediatric population. The present study assessed the safety and analgesic efficacy of FDETS in pediatric patients with clinically significant minor soft tissue injuries in USA-based practices compared with data from a previous study in adults.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec2">
        <title>Methods</title>
        <p id="Par10">This was an open-label, single-arm, phase IV non-randomized study conducted at ten family medicine or pediatric practices in the USA between May 2014 and October 2016. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the FDA Division of Anesthesia, Analgesia, and Addiction Products (DAAAP) as adequate to assess the safety and efficacy of the FDETS for the treatment of minor soft tissue injuries in pediatric patients aged 6 through 16 years of age. A central institutional review board approved the protocol at each participating site, and the study was conducted according to the ethical principles of human research established by the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments. At Visit 1, prior to enrolment, all children and their parent or legally authorized representative were given a verbal description of the study and required to read a Patient Information Sheet describing the intended research, including procedures, visit schedule, storage of investigational product, and diary completion instructions. Informed consent was required for all participants and/or their legal guardians. Two different consent documents were prepared: a Parental Permission Form, to be completed for all children by their parent/legally authorized representative, and a Children’s Assent Form, for completion by children 10–16 years of age. All participants and their legal guardians were given a copy of the applicable consent documents.</p>
        <p id="Par11">There was one protocol amendment that increased the eligibility interval from &lt; 48 to &lt; 96 h after injury occurrence to increase the likelihood of enrolling children with an acute injury.</p>
        <sec id="Sec3">
          <title>Patients</title>
          <p id="Par12">The study included children aged 6–16 years with a clinically significant minor soft tissue injury sustained within the preceding 96 h, and spontaneous pain of at least moderate severity, defined as a score of ≥ 3 on the 6-point Wong-Baker FACES<sup>®</sup> Pain Rating Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Post-menarche girls were required to have a negative pregnancy test.</p>
          <p id="Par13">Patients were excluded if their injury was midline or major, involved the spine, digits, or hands, or if they had open skin lesions within the injured area. In accordance with the Warnings and Precautions of the package insert, patients with severe cardiac, renal, or hepatic impairment were excluded from the study. Other exclusion criteria included the use of a long-acting NSAID since sustaining the injury, or topical medication within the past 48 h. A complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in the Online Resource 1 [Online Supplemental Material (OSM)]. Given the known very low diclofenac exposure following FDETS usage compared to oral diclofenac, specific monitoring for cardiovascular or renal events was not undertaken.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Sec4">
          <title>Treatment and Assessment</title>
          <p id="Par14">Eligible patients were given 28 FDETS, each containing 180 mg of diclofenac epolamine, equivalent to 140 mg of diclofenac sodium. Data from a pharmacokinetic study in healthy adult volunteers show that approximately 5–6% of the diclofenac epolamine content of a patch is released during the 12- to 24-h application period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
          <p id="Par15">Study personnel demonstrated to patients and parents/guardians how to apply FDETS at the injury site and applied the first topical system at the end of the inclusion visit. After that, patients or their parents/guardians were instructed to apply one FDETS in the morning and another 12 h later, each day until they returned to the clinic for the final visit (pain resolution or Day 14), and were requested to have a topical system in place at the time of each visit.</p>
          <p id="Par16">If the site of injury was such that the edges of the FDETS were going to overlap after application, it was trimmed to avoid overlap, and if a patch needed to be replaced because of exposure to water (e.g., during bathing or swimming), a third topical system could be used in a single day.</p>
          <p id="Par17">In addition to the Day 1 visit, patients were asked to return to the clinic on Days 2, 4, 7, and 14, but were allowed to exit the study at any time for any reason. Therefore, the final study visit was defined as Day 14 or the day after pain resolution. Because of inconsistent visit times by patients, visits were categorized as follows: screening, Days 1–2 after treatment initiation, Days 3–4, Days 5–7, Days 8–11, and Days 12–15. On Day 2 (24 h after first application) and at the final visit, a blood sample was collected for the assessment of diclofenac concentration.</p>
          <p id="Par18">Pre-treatment baseline pain was assessed in the clinic prior to the first FDETS application. The Wong-Baker FACES<sup>®</sup> Pain Rating Scale (0 = No hurt; 5 = Hurts worst) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] was used to assess pain severity. Patients were administered the Pain scale by the study personnel at the site on the occasion of the first in-clinic visit (inclusion visit). During the treatment period at home, pain was self-assessed by patients using the same scale and it was recorded in their personal diary. At each post-enrollment visit, the pain score, AEs, local tolerability (application site reactions), and vital signs were recorded by the study personnel, and at the final visit, the Investigator assessed the patient’s global response to therapy. Local tolerance was evaluated following patch removal by the Investigator using an application-site scoring scheme (described in Sect. <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">2.4</xref>), with a fresh patch to be applied on completion of the examination. AEs were categorized using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) codes.</p>
          <p id="Par19">Patients were asked to rate their pain in the morning and evening of each day and record this information in a diary; the first diary entry was made on the evening after the first FDETS was applied in the clinic. Patients were monitored throughout the study for AEs and were also asked to record any AEs, local tolerability issues, and/or concomitant medication/treatment in their diaries.</p>
          <p id="Par20">Patients were instructed not to use any other topical medication within the injured area for the duration of the study, as well as any medications that may interact with diclofenac, or pose a risk to patients (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, lithium, antidiabetic agents, or anticoagulants), any over-the-counter analgesics, short- or long-acting NSAIDs, narcotic analgesics, systemic steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, or immunosuppressive therapy. Patients were permitted to use rest-ice-compression-elevation (RICE) techniques both before and during the study. Any unused topical systems were to be returned to the clinic at the final visit.</p>

          <title>Bioanalytic Assay</title>
          <p id="Par21">Two 5 mL blood samples were collected from each patient for the assessment of diclofenac concentration, the first at Visit 2, 24 h after initial patch application on Day 1, and the second on the day of discontinuation from the study (i.e., following pain resolution or at the latest on Day 14). Both sample collections were made while the patch was still applied to the injury site. It should be noted that these were not at specific pre-dose timepoints, as the study protocol directed patch application in the evening and on the morning of the following day. Therefore, two to three patches may have been applied by the time of the first blood draw, depending on the time of the first visit.</p>
          <p id="Par22">Diclofenac concentrations were determined in plasma at inVentiv Health Clinique, inc., Québec (Canada) (now Syneos Health), according to a fully validated method described using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), with tandem mass spectrometry detection (MS-MS) having a quantitation range of 50–50,000 pg/mL (0.05–50 ng/mL).</p>

          <title>Outcomes</title>
          <p id="Par24">The primary endpoint of this study was local tolerability (redness, swelling) and systemic safety. AEs were categorized using MedDRA codes. Local tolerability was assessed at each clinical visit using a seven-item scale, where a score of 0 = no skin changes; 1 = faint redness; 2 = moderate redness; 3 = intense redness; 4 = redness with edema and papules; 5 = redness with weeping vesicles, blisters, or bullae; and 6 = redness with an extension of effect beyond the margin of the contact site.</p>
          <p id="Par25">Secondary endpoints included an assessment of the analgesic efficacy of FDETS, assessed by both patients and investigators on an ordinal scale, and stratified by age (6–11 years and 12–16 years) and diclofenac plasma concentrations in children in comparison to data obtained in a comparative study of FDETS versus oral diclofenac in adults (Study CRO-PK-01-72; data on file, IBSA). The study protocol and results of CRO-PK-01-72 are summarized in OSM Resource 3. Analgesic efficacy was assessed by patients using the Wong-Baker FACES<sup>®</sup> Pain Rating Scale (from 0 = no hurt to 5 = most hurt) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Investigators provided an assessment of global response to therapy on a 5-point scale from 1 = no clinical improvement in pain intensity and/or functional performance to 5 = restoration of normal functional performance in the absence of any pain. For comparative purposes, pain score data were compared with data from another study in adults (00GB/Fp05; data on file, IBSA).</p>

          <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
          <p id="Par26">Based on previous studies in adults, a population of 100 patients would have 80% power to detect a mean change from baseline of 0.354 in pain intensity score (on a 0–5 scale) with a two-sided alpha of 0.05. In a population of this size, the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for an AE incidence of 10% would be 4.9–17.6%.</p>
          <p id="Par27">Data were analyzed in all patients who applied ≥ 1 FDETS, with separate analyses undertaken in children aged 6–11 and 12–16 years. The two age classes were defined by the FDA according to regulatory and scientific standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The lower limit of the younger pediatric subgroup was set under the assumption that 6 years of age approximates the age at which children have sufficient size and aggressiveness to be at increased risk of minor soft tissue injuries requiring pain therapy, and the upper limit of 16 years represents the maximum age for a pediatric population according to the FDA.</p>
          <p id="Par28">Continuous variables were expressed as means with standard deviation and range. Categorical variables were expressed as number and percentage. The two age groups were compared using the <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test for continuous variables and Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. A mixed model, adjusting for multiple assessments per patient, was used for analysis of plasma diclofenac concentrations.</p>
          <p id="Par29">Twice-daily pain scores from patient diaries expressed as a proportion of the pre-treatment pain score for each patient were analyzed. A pain score of 1.0 indicated no change from baseline, while 0.0 indicated no discernible pain. Analyses were truncated at Day 13 (morning) in order to remove time periods with too few patients. Statistical analyses used a generalized estimating equation (GEE) model on all post-treatment pain scores with categorical factors for age category (6–11 years, 12–16 years, and adults) and assessment period (Day 0 evening, Day 1 morning–Day 1 evening, Day 2 morning–Day 2 evening, etc.). Multiple values from the same patient were treated as repeated measures using an independent correlation structure. The three individual group comparisons were not adjusted for multiplicity, and imputation for missing data was not performed. Global responses in the two age groups were compared using Fisher’s exact test.</p>
          <p id="Par30">For the pharmacokinetic analysis, individual, median, and mean steady-state diclofenac concentrations for each of the two age subgroups were calculated. Data from blood draws &gt; 13 h after the last FDETS application were excluded. The comparable adult data came from the separate CRO-PK-01-72 Study, with blood drawn from 0 to 24 h on Day 4 after steady-state concentrations were reached. The 90% CI of the difference between the estimated geometric means of plasma diclofenac concentrations after FDETS application in the adult and pediatric studies was calculated. In addition, the mean steady-state diclofenac concentrations from the pediatric study were compared with the mean maximum serum concentration resulting from a single 50 mg oral diclofenac tablet in the adult study.</p>
          <p id="Par31">Statistical analyses of the three FDETS treatment groups used a GEE model with a single factor for treatment. Multiple values from the same patient were treated as repeated measures using an exchangeable correlation structure. The three individual group comparisons were not adjusted for multiplicity. Data were analyzed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).</p>

        <p id="Par47">This study explored the safety and analgesic efficacy of FDETS in children aged 6–16 years with minor soft tissue injuries. There was a low potential risk of local or systemic AEs, and indeed, no serious AEs were observed in pediatric patients with minor soft tissue injuries receiving FDETS. The decline in pain scores for patients aged 12–16 years was similar to adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Systemic diclofenac exposure was minimal in the pediatric study population, as has been observed in adult patients treated with FDETS. Although there was minor age-related variability in mean diclofenac concentration 24 h after administration and at the final visit—slightly higher diclofenac plasma concentrations were observed in the subgroup of younger patients (6–11 years old)—this was somewhat to be expected considering the smaller surface and blood volume, in average, in this pediatric age class as compared to adults. However, the overall similarity between pharmacokinetic profiles and pain score data in pediatric subjects and an historical adult population is consistent with that obtained with FDETS in adults, and provides evidence that the FDETS delivers diclofenac and reduces pain in a similar manner in both pediatric and adult subjects. The data suggest that diclofenac plasma concentrations in children aged 6–16 years would not be expected to be higher than in adults following application of the FDETS according to current labeling, and safety data generated in the current pediatric study further suggest they are unlikely to experience safety issues not previously reported in older subjects.</p>
        <p id="Par48">The safety profile for FDETS in children was also similar to that in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], with the most common AEs being headache (8.7%) and pruritus (6.7%). In the pediatric population, gastrointestinal (GI) events occurred in 9.6% of patients, of which nausea occurred in 2.9%, abdominal discomfort in 2.9%, and upper abdominal pain in 1.9%, only one of which (nausea) was considered to be treatment-related. A pooled analysis of published FDETS data (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 890) indicated a similarly low incidence of GI AEs: nausea in 1.5%, abdominal discomfort in 0.6%, and abdominal pain in 0.4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In particular, the low incidence of GI AEs following application of FDETS makes it an attractive treatment option for children.</p>
        <p id="Par49">Faint redness was the only response to FDETS noted by the Investigators in local tolerability assessments. This was consistent with data in adults showing that FDETS exhibited local tolerability comparable to a placebo topical system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. There were no unique safety signals in the pediatric population that might change the product's risk profile in this patient group compared with adults.</p>
        <p id="Par50">The analgesic response over the first 7 days of treatment was greater in the patients aged 6–11 years than in patients aged 12–16 years, and the overall response was significantly better in comparison to both the older pediatric cohort as well as an adult historical control group. The superior analgesic response in the young pediatric patients was not correlated with diclofenac plasma concentrations as these were quite low and correspondingly variable, suggesting that plasma concentrations may not be correlated with tissue concentrations attained under the topical system.</p>
        <p id="Par51">Children treated with FDETS had low systemic exposure to diclofenac. Although the younger cohort had significantly higher diclofenac plasma concentrations than either the older pediatric patients or an adult historical control group, it is not clear whether this is due to differences in the histology of the skin of the younger children or other factors. Most importantly, however, plasma concentrations of diclofenac following oral dosing with diclofenac in adults were &gt; 500-fold greater than those resulting from FDETS exposure of either children or adults (Study CRO-PK-01-72), highlighting the principal advantage of FDETS over any systemic analgesic, including NSAIDs and acetaminophen.</p>
        <p id="Par52">The topical route of drug administration is attractive for treating children with minor soft tissue injuries because they sometimes have difficulty swallowing tablets or capsules, and because their skin is well perfused but relatively thin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Importantly, the data show FDETS has excellent local and systemic tolerability with no evidence of allergic reactions.</p>

          <title>Limitations</title>
          <p id="Par53">The present study has three main limitations: the first limitation is the absence of blinding (i.e., the open-label design); the second is the lack of a concurrent control group (e.g., a placebo topical system); and the third is the use of historical adult data.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p id="Par54">This study demonstrates that FDETS can safely and effectively provide pain relief for minor soft tissue injuries in pediatric patients, with minimal systemic NSAID exposure and low potential risk of either local or systemic AEs. The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic profile of the FLECTOR topical system in the pediatric population was consistent with data in adults obtained from a previous study.</p>
