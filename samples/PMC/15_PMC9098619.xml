            <p id="Par2">As part of a randomized, controlled Phase 2 clinical trial investigating a novel drug candidate for nocturnal polyuria, adult nocturia patients completed the NI Diary and a voiding diary for three nights preceding their clinic visit at Baseline and Weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12 (end of treatment). Exit interviews were conducted to obtain patient impressions of the NI Diary.</p>

            <title>Results</title>
            <p id="Par3">A total of <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 302 participants were included. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) indicated that the 11-item measure is unidimensional with values of CFI, TLI, and RMSEA meeting relevant thresholds. Good internal consistency (Cronbach’s <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> 0.941) and test–retest reliability (intra-class correlation coefficients 0.730–0.880). Convergent validity with two reference measures was demonstrated with strong correlations of 0.573–0.730 were shown. Significant differences (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0018, standardized effect size = 0.372) between groups defined by number of night-time voids supported known-groups validity. Exit interviews in 66 patients indicated all participants experienced improvement in at least 1 NI Diary item and that a 1-point improvement on the item response scale and 1-void reduction per night (associated with an average best cut point on ROC analysis of − 11.6) constituted meaningful improvement. Anchor and distribution-based analyses identified a meaningful change threshold of − 15 to − 18 points on the NI Diary.</p>

        <title>Plain English summary</title>
        <p id="Par6">Waking up in the middle of the night to urinate is a condition called nocturia and can be very bothersome. To get an idea of how much of an impact this condition has on a person’s life, we tested a NI Diary where patients with this condition can answer a series of 12 questions pertaining to how this condition affects them. During a 12-week clinical trial in which participants received a novel drug candidate, participants were asked on five occasions to answer these questions every evening for three consecutive nights preceding the visit to the clinic. A number of measurement tests were conducted on the diary to ensure it reliably assesses the severity of nocturia and its impact on quality of life (QoL) in the patient population. In exit interviews, participants expressed support for the usefulness of this Diary to reflect their views. This Diary may become a valuable tool for use in clinical trials and real-world studies.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p id="Par7">Nocturia, or waking to pass urine during the main sleep period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], is a highly prevalent lower urinary tract syndrome affecting men and women of all ages, with higher rates in older populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although nocturia can have multiple causes, the most common is nocturnal polyuria—overproduction of urine at night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Lifestyle modifications are the first intervention for the management of nocturia but as symptoms progress, such measures may be inadequate, and pharmacotherapy warranted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Nocturia has a pronounced negative impact on patient QoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and is associated with reduced work productivity, more frequent physician visits, socioeconomic burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], sleep impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], higher risk of falls and fractures, depression, and increased mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. There has, however, been an unmet need for a validated, reliable, and specific patient-reported instrument to assess the impact of nocturia on patient QoL. The most frequently used symptom-specific nocturia questionnaire, the Nocturia QoL (N-QoL) was validated only in males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], with the content validity reexamined subsequently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, the measure did not meet the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 2009 guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] for content validity and the recall period (14 days or 1 month) was considered too long for a fluctuating disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. To provide a more acceptable patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure for use in clinical trials, a 12-item Nocturia Impact (NI) Diary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] was developed in dialogue with the FDA to measure the daily symptom impact of nocturia, to be used in conjunction with a nocturnal voiding diary. The NI Diary has 11 core items assessing impacts such as sleep disturbance, emotional disturbance, and fatigue, and a single overall QoL item. An earlier study with a small number of patients supported its psychometric properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The current study extends this work, investigating the reliability, validity, and interpretability of the NI Diary in a larger sample, using a range of evaluations (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait">

The current study is an independent, treatment-agnostic psychometric evaluation of the NI Diary performed to support the interpretation of the NI Diary as an endpoint in this trial. Patients completed the NI Diary and the nocturnal voiding diary for three nights preceding each visit at the clinic at Baseline, Week 1, 4, 8, and 12 (end of treatment).</p>

          <p id="Par9">Participants for this analysis were from the intent-to-treat (ITT) population from the trial and had completed the NI Diary at baseline. The sample size determination for the clinical trial was based on different dose–response scenarios indicating a required range of 60–75 patients per arm to achieve 80% to 90% power for the primary endpoint (reduction in nocturnal voids). The sample size of 302 patients exceeds the conservative minimum sample size of 10 patients per item for factor analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], as well as providing sufficient power (80%) to detect, at two-sided <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .05, typical psychometric endpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

            <title>NI Diary</title>
            <p id="Par10">The NI Diary© is a 12-item questionnaire with 11 core items and a single overall QoL impact question (Q12) that assesses the daily symptom impact of nocturia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The NI Diary was completed in the evenings with the recall periods “thinking over the day” (items 1–6), “thinking about last night” (items 7–8) and “overall” (items 10–12). Each item is rated on a 5-point response scale from 0 to 5 (“not at all”; “slightly”; “moderately”; “quite a bit”; “a great deal”). Q12 of the NI Diary, evaluating the overall impact of nocturia, is used separately. The NI Diary total score, the sum of questions 1 to 11, has a range of 0 (lowest severity) to 44 (greatest severity). Both the total score and Q12 were transformed to a 0–100 scale. The total score was computed only if all items were answered, otherwise, it was defined as missing. Missing values were not imputed. For the purposes of this analysis, the total scores at each timepoint were averaged over the three nights, except for assessing quality of completion and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).</p>

          <p id="Par38">Before entering the trial, more than half of participants (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 39–62) reported experiencing each NI Diary item except item 8 ‘Worried about tripping or falling’ (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 29). All participants reported improvement in at least one item of the NI Diary over the trial period. Fifty-three participants (80.3%) reported improvement in nocturnal urinations throughout the trial, none reported worsening, and 13 (19.7%) reported no change. Those reporting higher levels of improvement in the PGI-I experienced a greater reduction in nocturnal voids, with 81% of participants considering that a 1-point improvement on each NI Diary item response scale was meaningful. For instance, for the Tiredness question, one participant stated a 1-point difference means “Um, just that I'm getting more sleep and I'm not as tired”. A reduction of 1 void per night was considered to be meaningful (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 30; 45.5%; see Online Resource Table S7). Across global rating responses (i.e., PGI-S, PGI-I) patients described the response categories to mean: “A little better” (sleeping more, less tired), “Much better” (Sleep more, less tired, mood improved, better concentration, work productivity better), and “Very much better” (Sleep more, less tired, mood improved, less impact on daily activities, better concentration, less avoidance of activities, easier falling back asleep, improved work productivity).</p>

            <p id="Par41">There was some degree of overlap in the 95% CIs for true mean change between the “1-category” and “no change” groups for the two anchors of change in nocturnal voids and PGI-I (the non-overlapping 95% CIs for the other anchors indicated that the groups were distinct). Consequently, both “1-category” and “2-category” change in these anchors were considered. These overlaps can, however, be explained by the “no change” nocturnal voids category including only 21 patients and the PGI-I anchors being limited by having no “moderately better” category.</p>
            <p id="Par42">The change in NI Diary total scores for the “1-category” change groups are summarized for each anchor in Table S6; the mean change scores range from − 8.0 (PGI-I) to − 18.7 (NI Diary Q12), and the median change scores from − 5.9 (PGI-I) to − 18.9 (NI Diary Q12). It is important to note that the exit interview patient reports of a reduction of 1 void per night being meaningful is consistent with the choice of the “1 category” − 0.5 to − 1.5 nocturnal void reduction category to indicate meaningful change, with a mean (median) NI Diary total score change of − 14.7 (− 10.6). The much larger mean (median) changes in the “Much better” category of − 20.4 (− 16.7) and − 21.9 (− 21.2) for the PGI-I and PGI-I Interview, respectively, versus those in the “A little better” category of − 8.0 (− 5.9) and − 8.2 (− 5.9), indicate that these values are likely to provide an overestimate of meaningful change. The mean NI Diary total score change across all 4 “A little better” and “Much better” PGI-I mean change values is − 15.0. The average 95% CI for true mean change across each anchor, within each “1-category” anchor change category, is − 8.0 to − 18.7.</p>

            <title>ROC analyses</title>
            <p id="Par44">The findings from the ROC analyses were consistent with those from the other anchor-based methods, with the BCPs increasing the greater the average reduction of nocturnal voids. The BCP at d(0, 1) in the NI Diary change score for identifying participants who reported an average reduction of nocturnal voids of ≥ 0.5 was − 6.82; for ≥ 1.0 it was -9.47; for ≥ 1.5 it was − 17.4; and for ≥ 2.5 it was − 24.2. Given that the patients in the exit interviews reported that a reduction of 1 nocturnal void was meaningful, the ROC curve for identifying participants who reported an average reduction of nocturnal voids of at least 1.0 [BCP =  − 9.47 for d(0, 1) and − 11.6 overall] is presented in Fig. S4 of the Online Resource.</p>

            <title>Triangulation of results across anchor- and distribution-based data and exit interviews</title>
            <p id="Par46">The findings from the exit interviews indicated that a 1-point improvement in each NI Diary item is considered meaningful to patients; in the 11-item scale this would equate to an overall change of 11 points. This is consistent with the distribution-based estimates, with the value of 11 being larger than both 10.90 (0.5 SD) and 5.30 (SEM) and thus above measurement error. In the exit interviews the patients reported that an improvement of 1 void per night was meaningful; the ROC BCPs linked to this level of improvement were − 9.47 and − 11.6. The BCP from a ROC analysis would be expected to provide a lower bound for the MCT as it is the value that best distinguishes those who improve from those who do not. These findings suggest that a minimum MCT in the range of 10–11 points would be most likely to identify patients who have experienced a meaningful improvement in their symptoms. The anchor-based within-category change data support these findings with the average mean change across all anchors in the “1-category” improvement group of − 14.0 points, ranging from − 8.0 in the “A little Better” PGI-I category to − 18.7 in the NI Diary Q12 (and the average 95% CI also being − 8.0 to − 18.7). Taking into account the maximum separation observed in the CDF curves between − 10 and − 20 and the non-overlapping CIs for the “no-change” and “1-category” improvement groups, a conservative reduction of 15 to 18 points was taken as the MCT (in line with the smallest median change score in the non-overlapping groups of − 14.8). Thus, taking a reduction of 15–18 points in the NI Diary total score as the MCT would be consistent with all the results presented, anchor- and distribution-based as well as the patient perspective provided in the exit interviews.</p>

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p id="Par47">This study has provided additional psychometric evidence to support the validity and reliability of the NI Diary, together with an estimate of meaningful change, thus enhancing the interpretation of improvement on the NI Diary. The CFA supported the hypothesized unidimensionality of the 11-item NI Diary and the scoring algorithm. This was further evidenced by high internal consistency reliability of the measure and with inter-item correlations in the range 0.40–0.90 indicating that items were generally not redundant or overlapping. Item discrimination curves indicated response categories were adequately separated. A proposed MCT in the range of 15‒18 points for the standardized NI Diary total score was determined by triangulating information from the within-category change for all five anchors with the findings from the ROC analysis and distribution-based methods, together with findings from the exit interviews, and provides a conservative estimate of meaningful change.</p>
        <p id="Par48">All analyses were conducted following the FDA Guidance for development and validation of patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, a few limitations exist for the analyses presented. Incorporating post hoc correlated residuals in the CFA model (justified by similar item wording), nearly always improved model fit, but at the possible expense of generalizability of the model and with implications for the equal weighting of items within a sum score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. When models are modified based on MIs (which often can be unstable), cross-validation of results is highly recommended in another sample to test validity of the modified model) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The limitation in this study stems from the lack of such cross-validation using a different sample. Within the Exit Interview, what constitutes meaningful change was only queried for the NI Diary and nocturnal voids, thus no claims about meaningfulness of change from the patient’s perspective can be made for the PGI-S or PGI-I categories of change, although those scales were debriefed with patients in work preceding the inclusion in the clinical trial.</p>
        <p id="Par49">Determining what constitutes a meaningful change on an instrument requires linking meaningfulness from the patient’s perspective with statistical determination of response thresholds that may be interpreted as a treatment benefit. This is the first psychometric validation and examination of response thresholds for the NI Diary using a mixed methods approach with clinical trial data. While there are benefits of applying multiple anchors and multiple analytic methods, there are no clear and concise guidelines for how to interpret these results and determine a threshold, especially if threshold values vary between anchors. Moreover, the thresholds are sample dependent and thus require further validation using comparable datasets.</p>
        <p id="Par50">Despite these limitations, this research presents parameters for interpreting the scores in the nocturia patient population. Exit interviews demonstrated that patient impressions on the NI Diary were in alignment with quantitative psychometric data, thus providing support for the use of NI Diary in both clinical trial and real-world studies. Overall, these findings provide substantive evidence that the NI Diary is fit-for-purpose for deriving patient-relevant endpoints in clinical research for nocturia.</p>
