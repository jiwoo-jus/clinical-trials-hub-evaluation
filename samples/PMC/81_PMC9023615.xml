        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p id="P17">Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a proliferative disorder of the retinal vasculature that occurs in infants born extremely preterm. There is a delay in physiologic retinal vascular development along with vaso-attenuation early on in postnatal life followed by vaso-proliferation with neovascularization later.<sup>
            <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
          </sup> Severe ROP carries a risk of blindness. Serial screening eye exams are performed for infants at risk of ROP to identify disease that threatens vision and to enable timely intervention. One-third of children born extremely preterm have an eye or visual problem, and the rate of eye or visual problems climbs to over two-thirds when evaluating children who were treated for ROP.<sup>
            <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
          </sup>
        </p>
        <p id="P18">More severe forms of ROP for which infants undergo treatment, including laser photocoagulation or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) administration, are associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. In the ELGAN Study cohort, infants with severe ROP were at increased risk for low scores on the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-II (BSID-II) at 24 months after adjusting for risk factors for both ROP and brain injury.<sup>
            <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
          </sup> In the EXPRESS cohort, Holmstrom et al. found a significant correlation between visual impairment and treated ROP as well as between visual impairment and cognitive disability at 2.5 years.<sup>
            <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
          </sup> There were major eye or visual problems in 37.9% (147/388) of preterm children born at &lt;27 weeks’ gestation compared to 6.2% of term children at 6.5 years.<sup>
            <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
          </sup> Among the preterm children, 2.1% were blind, 4.8% were visually impaired by WHO criteria (&lt;20/60), and 8.8% were visually impaired by study criteria (&lt;20/40). In follow-up of preterm infants enrolled in the caffeine for apnea of prematurity trial, Schmidt and colleagues found an association between severe ROP and non-visual disabilities at 5 years of age.<sup>
            <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
          </sup> The incidence of severe ROP (defined as stage 4 or 5 disease or receipt of retinal therapy) was 6.5%, but only 0.9% of children were bilaterally blind. Of the children with severe ROP, 39.5% had at least 1 non-visual disability at 5 years compared with 15.8% of children without severe ROP (p&lt;0.001). The rates for more than one non-visual disability differed between those with severe ROP (14.9%) and those without severe ROP (2.4%, p&lt;0.001). Motor impairment, cognitive impairment, and severe hearing loss were all more common in children with severe ROP than in those without severe ROP. In a Canadian cohort of preterm infants born at 24-28 weeks’ gestation, cognitive and motor composite scores at 18 months corrected age were negatively impacted in children with severe ROP after adjusting for gestational age and severe brain injury.<sup>

        <p id="P19">Most of the aforementioned cohorts focused on severe ROP, which despite some variability in definitions, included treated ROP and stage 4 or 5 ROP. Not all ROP requires intervention because less severe (i.e. lower stage) ROP may regress without treatment. We need to better understand the relationship between ROP across the severity spectrum, including lower stage ROP that subsequently regresses, and neurodevelopment in early childhood. The effects of severe forms of major neonatal morbidities endure beyond infancy, but less is known about the effects of less severe forms of the major morbidities, including ROP. This study evaluated the neurodevelopment and vision outcomes of infants with ROP that did not undergo intervention compared to infants without ROP. This is an important knowledge gap to address in order to understand the associations of neonatal ophthalmologic pathology identified during ROP screening examinations and subsequent neurodevelopment and to inform counseling related to ROP across the severity spectrum.</p>

Maternal race differed between children with no ROP and children with ROP without intervention while maternal education differed between children with ROP without intervention and children with ROP with intervention (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Gestational age and birth weight differed between children with no ROP and those with ROP without intervention as well as between children with ROP without intervention and those with ROP with intervention.

The CBCL T-scores were similar for children with ROP without intervention and children with no history of ROP with the exception of aggressive behavior, attention deficit/hyperactivity problems, and externalizing problems. In each of these domains, the T-score differed by less than 2 points for the groups. The T-score was statistically lower (better) for children with ROP without intervention than children without ROP.

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p id="P27">This investigation addressed the knowledge gap in understanding the relationship between ROP that regresses without intervention and neurodevelopment. For children born extremely preterm, those with ROP stage ≤3 that regressed without intervention were no more likely to have adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years’ corrected age than children born extremely preterm without a history of ROP. Outcomes assessed included motor, cognitive, and language skills as well as neurological examination, cerebral palsy, and hearing loss. While parents of children with history of ROP without intervention reported fewer difficulties in the domains of aggressive behavior, attention deficit/hyperactivity problems, and externalizing problems than parents of children with no history of ROP, both groups’ T-scores fell within the normal range. Regarding ophthalmologic outcomes, children born extremely preterm with history of ROP stage ≤3 without intervention were more likely to have strabismus than children born extremely preterm without a history of ROP. There were four children with ROP stage ≤3 without intervention who were blind with some functional vision at follow-up. This is a clinically significant outcome but given the small number of patients we were unable to evaluate for a difference between groups. Ophthalmologic follow-up is necessary for extremely preterm infants, including those who did not undergo intervention for ROP, given the possibility of vision impairment.</p>
        <p id="P28">By contrast, children who underwent an ophthalmologic intervention for ROP had worse neurodevelopmental and vision outcomes at 2 years’ corrected age than did children born extremely preterm who did not undergo an intervention for ROP. While the incidence of cerebral palsy or behavioral problems was similar between the two groups, children with ROP who received an intervention were more likely to have worse gross motor function and to have hearing loss compared to children with history of ROP stage ≤3 without intervention. Regarding ophthalmologic outcomes, children born extremely preterm with history of ROP with intervention had worse visual acuity than children with history of ROP stage ≤3 without intervention. Although the two groups did not differ in the incidence of other ophthalmologic outcomes, the difference for the incidence of nystagmus approached statistical significance with nearly 13% of children with ROP with intervention affected by nystagmus compared to just over 2% of children with ROP without intervention (aRR 4.09, 95% CI 1.00 to 16.81).</p>
        <p id="P29">Data on children with blindness suggests that we should not look at vision outcomes in isolation from other neurodevelopmental outcomes. De Verdier et al. evaluated disability among 150 children affected by blindness in Sweden. The most common etiology of blindness in the cohort was ROP (34 children, 24%).<sup>
            <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
          </sup> There was a high incidence of coexisting non-visual disability, mostly commonly intellectual disability, with 54% of children having more than one additional disability. One possible pathophysiologic explanation for worse developmental outcomes is diminished visual acuity. Alternatively, there may be common pathways leading to impaired neural and vascular development in the brain and retina. Altered white matter maturation is another possible explanation for altered neurodevelopment in children affected by ROP.<sup>
            <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
          </sup> White matter maturation in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, external capsule, and optic radiations, regions critical for visual and motor pathways, is delayed in extremely preterm infants with severe ROP.<sup>

            <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
          </sup> They found that children with ROP had smaller unmyelinated white matter and cerebellar volumes and lower BSID-II scores than children without ROP after adjusting for perinatal risk factors.</p>
        <p id="P30">Because ROP occurs on a spectrum and because there may be shared physiology for brain and retinal development, it is important to understand neurodevelopment and ophthalmologic outcomes of children affected by less severe forms of ROP. This investigation adds to the literature evidence that milder forms of ROP, defined as ROP stage ≤3 without intervention, are not associated with poorer neurodevelopment among children born extremely preterm. Multiple studies have shown that severe ROP is associated with worse neurodevelopmental and ophthalmologic outcomes in affected children.<sup>

          </sup> Similarly, follow-up at 5.5 years of children enrolled in the multicenter trial of cryotherapy for ROP identified an association between the functional status and ROP severity. Any ROP had a relative risk of 2.27 (95% CI 1.26-4.07) for scoring in the lowest functional status, which was described as severe disability. While the focus of the trial was on those children with threshold disease (five or more contiguous or 8 cumulative clock hours of ROP stage ≥3 in either zone 1 or 2), the investigators were insightful in reporting the outcomes of those with less severe forms of ROP.<sup>

        <p id="P31">The current study identified differential neurodevelopment of young children with history of ROP with ophthalmologic intervention compared to children with history of ROP without intervention. In contrast, Molloy and colleagues evaluated visual processing, visual learning, visual-motor integration, intelligence quotient, and academic achievement in 180 adolescents born extremely preterm.<sup>
            <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
          </sup> The adolescents were grouped by ROP status into severe ROP (stage 3 or greater) versus no or mild ROP (stage 1 or 2). After controlling for perinatal risk, only visual acuity scores differed between adolescents with history of severe ROP (stage ≥3) and those with history of mild ROP (stage 1 or 2).</p>
        <p id="P32">Strengths of this study include the multicenter design, availability of ROP examination and intervention data from the inpatient and outpatient settings, and comprehensive neurologic follow-up at 22-26 months’ corrected age. The eye examination at 2 years, conducted as part of the neurological examination, included assessment for strabismus, nystagmus, roving eye movements, and ability to track 180 degrees. A limitation of the study was that visual acuity was obtained by history, either by parent report or review of the medical record, at the 2-year follow-up visit. There were not confirmatory ophthalmologic examinations to validate parent report of vision. There may have been variability in reporting the need for corrective lenses as well as a potential for referral bias to outpatient ophthalmology follow-up for those infants who underwent intervention for ROP. An additional limitation was the lack of postnatal growth evaluation; postnatal growth may also relate to both the risk of neurodevelopmental impairment and to the risk of ROP. Finally, the young age of follow-up may be a limitation with respect to assessment of neurodevelopment and vision outcomes. At two years, children are not yet able to be evaluated for executive function and academic achievement, two domains in which children born extremely preterm may manifest difficulties later in childhood.<sup>

        <p id="P33">This study informs ROP-related counseling for clinicians who care for extremely preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit as well as in outpatient follow-up. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were similar for children born extremely preterm with history of ROP stage ≤3 without intervention and those without ROP. Follow-up with ophthalmology is important for children born preterm with ROP stage ≤3 without intervention given the higher incidence of strabismus compared to those without ROP as well as the occurrence of blindness with some functional vision in a few children at follow-up. In contrast, both neurodevelopment, including motor, cognitive, and language skills, and visual acuity are more problematic for those children who underwent ophthalmologic intervention for ROP compared to those with less severe forms of ROP without intervention. Anticipatory counseling pertaining to ophthalmologic and developmental outcomes is indicated for all children born extremely preterm. This study informs how counseling may be tailored by the severity of ROP. Specifically, the neurodevelopmental outcomes of children with ROP without intervention do not differ notably from the outcomes of children born extremely preterm with no history of ROP at two years. Longer-term follow-up is needed to fully understand the associations between ROP without ophthalmologic intervention, neurodevelopment, and vision since neurodevelopment and vision difficulties may manifest later in childhood.</p>
