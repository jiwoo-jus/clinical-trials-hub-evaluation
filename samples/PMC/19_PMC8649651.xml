            <p>This study was designed to assess the efficacy of <italic toggle="yes">Bifidobacterium animalis</italic> ssp. <italic toggle="yes">lactis</italic> (Bl-04) for prevention of rhinovirus colds and to explore the interactions between the probiotic, the viral infection, the host response and the host microbiome.</p>

            <title>Methods</title>
            <p>The effect of ingestion of the probiotic Bl-04 was evaluated in a randomized, double-blinded rhinovirus (RV) challenge study. Healthy volunteers recruited from a university community in USA were randomized 1:1 using a computer generated code to ingest either Bl-04 (n=165) or placebo (n=169) for 28 days and were then challenged with RV-A39, and followed for 14 days. All study interactions and sample collection occurred in dedicated clinical research space. The primary analysis was the effect of the probiotic on the incidence of RV-associated illness. (Trial registration: <ext-link ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" ns0:href="NCT02679807">NCT02679807</ext-link>, study complete).</p>

            <title>Findings</title>
            <p>The first cohort of volunteers was randomized on March 14, 2016 and the last (5<sup>th</sup>) cohort was randomized on March 12, 2018. Sixty-three (56%, 95% CI [47%; 66%]) of the 112 subjects in the active group and 60 (50%,95% CI [41%; 59%]) of the 120 subjects in the placebo group had a protocol-defined rhinovirus-associated illness (χ<sup>2</sup>=0·91, p=0·34). The point estimate of the difference in illness (active-placebo) is 6.3% (95% CI -6.7;19.1). There were no adverse events that were judged as definitely or probably related to the study product.</p>
          </sec>
          <sec>
            <title>Interpretation</title>
            <p>In this study there was no effect of orally administered Bl-04 on the occurrence of RV-associated illness.</p>

The current evidence suggests that orally administered Bl-04 does not have a beneficial treatment effect on rhinovirus infections or illness. The absence of definitive effects of the probiotic on the host and host response suggest that the current understanding of potential mechanisms of action for probiotics in viral respiratory infection should be further evaluated.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p id="para0001">Probiotics, “live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host” are among the most commonly consumed dietary supplements [<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>]. A variety of probiotic preparations have been studied for different human illnesses with some evidence of a beneficial effect on various diarrheal and gastrointestinal disorders [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The results of studies using probiotics for the treatment or prevention of viral respiratory illnesses have; however, been inconsistent [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These inconsistent results may be due to the variable quality of the study designs and results reporting of the clinical trials <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. These trials have generally not addressed potential mechanisms of action in humans, and the proposed mechanism of action of probiotics as treatment for viral respiratory disease have been based primarily on animal models [<xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
        <p id="para0002">The experimental RV challenge model has been used for many years as a tool for the exploration of pathogenesis, prevention and treatment of these infections in human volunteers in a well-controlled, clinically relevant setting. Previous studies of a probiotic, <italic toggle="yes">Bifidobacterium animalis,</italic> subsp. <italic toggle="yes">lactis</italic> Bl-04 (Bl-04), in the experimental challenge model were directed at examining the effect of the probiotic on the nasal innate immune response to the viral infection <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Modest but inconsistent immune effects were noted and associated exploratory analyses suggested effects on viral shedding. Another exploratory analysis from the study found apparent effects of the nasal microbiota, unrelated to probiotic consumption, on the clinical and immunologic response to the RV infection <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The purpose of the present study was to further explore in a larger challenge study the effects of Bl-04 on clinical outcomes associated with RV infection as well as assess the virologic, immunologic, and microbiomic basis for any observed effect.</p>

        <title>Methods</title>
        <p id="para0003">
          <italic toggle="yes">Subjects</italic>: Healthy adult volunteers, 18-60 years old, were recruited by posted advertisements from the University of Virginia community. Written informed consent was obtained prior to study participation in a form approved by the Human Investigations Committee of the University of Virginia (FWA#:00006183) and the study was conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practices and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The trial was registered in clinicaltrials.gov (<ext-link ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" ns0:href="NCT02679807">NCT02679807</ext-link>) and the study protocol is available at that site. Subjects were compensated for participation. Volunteers susceptible to RV type 39, as evidenced by a serum neutralizing antibody titer of ≤.1:4, were invited to participate. Volunteers who had significant underlying respiratory or gastrointestinal disease or had an acute illness were excluded.</p>
        <p id="para0004">
          <italic toggle="yes">Study material and randomization</italic>: The active supplement was <italic toggle="yes">Bifidobacterium animalis</italic> ssp. <italic toggle="yes">lactis</italic> Bl-04 (Danisco US, Madison, WI). The daily dose of probiotic was provided in a sachet containing a minimum of 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> colony forming units of Bl-04 mixed with 1g of sucrose as a carrier. The placebo was provided as a sachet containing 1g of sucrose that was identical to the study product in appearance, smell, and taste. Volunteers enrolled in the study were randomized 1:1 to the probiotic or placebo group. The randomization sequence was created by the study sponsor using nQuery Advisor software (version 7.0.1490.0) using a block size of 6. All study personnel involved in the conduct and analysis of the study were blinded to the randomization scheme until the study database was locked. Volunteers were assigned sequential subject numbers as they enrolled in the study and then provided numbered study product corresponding to their subject number.</p>
        <p id="para0005">
          <italic toggle="yes">Conduct of the study</italic>: The study design was similar to that described in a previous study <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Study cohorts were conducted in the Spring of 2016, 2017, and 2018 and in the Fall of 2016 and 2017. All cohorts were conducted in an identical fashion; the schedule for study activities is outlined in <xref rid="sec00175" ref-type="fn">Supplemental Material Table 1</xref>. On day -28 of the study, all eligible volunteers had specimens collected and were then randomized to active or placebo supplement to be taken daily through study day 14. Volunteers returned to the study site on days -21, -14, and -7 to replenish supplies of study product and to monitor compliance with the study protocol. During the supplementation period, days -28 to 14, the volunteers were instructed to avoid ingestion of other probiotics or probiotic containing foods and were prohibited from taking antibiotics or anti-inflammatory agents.</p>
        <p id="para0006">
          <italic toggle="yes">Assessment of compliance and blinding</italic>: Compliance with study supplements was assessed by counting used sachets of the study products and by qPCR for Bl-04 on stool specimens collected at day 0. The adequacy of study blinding was assessed on day 0, after 28 days of supplementation but prior to virus challenge, by asking volunteers whether they believed they were receiving the active or placebo preparation or “don't know”.</p>

          <title>Statistical analysis</title>
          <p id="para0015">The primary outcome variable for this study was the incidence of rhinovirus-associated illness compared between the active and placebo groups. A rhinovirus-associated illness was defined by the study protocol as an illness that met the study criteria for illness in a volunteer who also met the definition for RV infection as described above. The per-protocol analysis cohort was the volunteers who were susceptible to RV-A39 (serum neutralizing antibody titer ≤ 1:4), had no virus detected in the nasal lavage on day 0, were infected with RV-A39, and completed the study taking at least 80% of the intended treatment doses. Two subjects voluntarily withdrew from the study after the virus challenge. These volunteers were excluded from the per-protocol analysis. There were two missing symptom score data points of 1160 in the per-protocol analysis cohort. No correction or imputation was made for the missing data.</p>
          <p id="para0016">Sample size analysis: The sample size for this study was calculated on the primary endpoint of rhinovirus-induced illnesses. The challenge model results in an infection rate of approximately 90% in the control group. Approximately 60% of all infected volunteers are expected to develop a symptomatic illness and will meet the study definition of a rhinovirus-induced illness. A sample size of 95 completed subjects/arm would be expected to detect a reduction in rhinovirus-induced illness of 20% (from 60% to 40%) with 80% power with pα= 0.05. A reduction from 60% to 40% was established as a target effect based on results of previous successful studies in the rhinovirus challenge model [<xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To ensure that a sufficient number of volunteers would be evaluable by the protocol criteria, a target of 254 subjects challenged with the study virus was established.</p>
          <p id="para0017">Analysis of results: The relationship between treatment and incidence of rhinovirus-associated illness was assessed by a chi-square test. Duration of illness, incidence of viral infection, quantitative viral shedding, shedding of virus in nasal lavage, and total symptom score both during the acute illness period and during the total study period were analyzed as secondary endpoints. The relationship between treatment and incidence of infection and shedding of virus in nasal lavage were analyzed exactly the same way as the primary response. For duration of illness Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used to compare durations between treatments. Quantitative viral shedding was analyzed with a repeated measures analysis of variance model (RM-ANOVA). Total symptom scores were analyzed with Poisson regression analysis models using the generalized estimating equations (GEE) technique for repeated measures. The main interest in these analysis models was the over-time treatment effect. All p values for these analyses were two-sided tests. A hierarchical strategy was used to control the type I error in the secondary analyses. As exploratory endpoints, changes in CXCL8, IFN-γ, IL-10, G-CSF, MCP-1, IP-10, IL-6, and IL-1β concentrations both from day -28 until virus challenge and from day 0 onwards were analyzed with repeated measures analysis of covariance models (RM-ANCOVA). For the exploratory endpoints there was no correction for multiple comparisons. All p-values are reported as two-tailed tests. A complete description of the statistical methods for the study is provided as <xref rid="sec00175" ref-type="fn">Supplemental Material</xref> and the Statistical Analysis Plan is provided at clinicaltrials.gov. The data in the study were captured in an electronic database (Viedoc™ Clinic; PCG Solutions AB, Uppsala, Sweden), all data were entered at the study site and monitored for accuracy.

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p id="para0031">This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study using the RV challenge model found no effect of oral administration of Bl-04 on RV infection or illness. These results are similar to the outcome of a previous study using the challenge model.<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> However, in contrast to the results of our previous study, we also found no substantial evidence of an effect of probiotic administration on the innate inflammatory response in the nose or on virus shedding. Similarly, an exploratory analysis in our previous study found evidence of an interaction between the nasal microbiome and clinical, virologic and immunologic responses to the virus infection that were not fully replicated in the current study <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
        <p id="para0032">The challenge model has been used for decades for the study of pathogenesis and treatment of viral respiratory infection in general and RV infection in particular and has proven to be a sensitive tool for detecting the effect of various treatments and a reliable predictor of the results in subsequent field trials <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The challenge model is limited by the fact that the route of inoculation is artificial and only a single serotype of rhinovirus is tested. Although a previous field trial found a modest effect of Bl-04 on the incidence of viral respiratory illness, that study did not characterize the infection status of the ill subjects <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Previous experience with the challenge model suggests that it is unlikely that an effect would be found in a field trial directed at rhinovirus infections and illness.</p>
        <p id="para0033">Many clinical trials have explored the effect of probiotics on URTI. However, most clinical trials have been conducted in children and the low number of studies in adults have made systematic comparison challenging [<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although some of these trials have reported beneficial effects, the results have been inconsistent. Many of the studies have not included viral diagnostics and the reported effects, whether frequency of illness, duration of illness, or severity of illness vary from study-to-study. Furthermore, there is little information about probiotic strain-specific effects, optimal dose, and potential mechanisms of action. Reviews of these studies have concluded that the usefulness of probiotics in viral upper respiratory disease is uncertain and more studies are needed to clarify the effectiveness of probiotics in healthy adults [<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Our study was designed to address some of the deficiencies in the earlier studies by using a well-defined and well-controlled model involving documented infection with single pathogen and an adequate sample size to detect a meaningful effect. The study also included extensive analysis by virologic, immunologic, transcriptomic, and microbiomic assays to assess the clinical and biologic effects of probiotic administration and interaction with viral infection.</p>
        <p id="para0034">One potential mechanism of action of the probiotics is alteration of the gastrointestinal or nasopharyngeal microbiota in a way that influences the innate immune response <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The ability to conduct longitudinal assessments of individual volunteers with collection of specimens in a fixed relation to the time of consumption of the probiotic and the initiation of the viral infection provides a powerful tool for the study of both microbiota and immunological responses to the probiotic. The administration of Bl-04 in the present study had no clinically relevant effect on cytokine responses or expression of innate immune or proinflammatory genes. Similarly, the oral administration of the probiotic did not produce a detectable change in either the fecal or the nasopharyngeal microbiota, supporting the idea that the microbiota of healthy subjects is relatively resistant to change by probiotic supplementation <xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Future studies of probiotics that have purported clinical effects should include similar assessment of both immunological and microbiota parameters.</p>
        <p id="para0035">A number of studies, including an exploratory analysis of data from our previous challenge study, have suggested an association between the composition of the nasopharyngeal microbiota and the incidence or severity of viral respiratory infection [<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>]. Many of these studies have been done in young infants and have reported a positive correlation between the abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Haemophilus</italic> species and severity of bronchiolitis. Interestingly, the influence of the microbiota on disease severity appears to vary by viral pathogen <xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. There is little longitudinal information about the interaction of the nasopharyngeal microbiota and viral respiratory infection in adults. Allen, <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. <xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, reported that bacterial detection from nasal lavage fluid was not statistically significantly influenced during a RV infection although <italic toggle="yes">Haemophilus</italic> species were less abundant in specimens from infected subjects. In our exploratory analysis and in the current study we also found that the composition of the nasal microbiota was not altered by the RV infection. In contrast to the findings of the current study, our previous study found evidence that different patterns of species dominance in the nasal cavity were associated with effects on viral replication, cytokine elaboration and symptom severity. The failure to detect these patterns in this study may be due to the fact that the species were differentiated at a more granular level (ASVs rather than OTUs) that would potentially obscure this finding. Additional work will be required to resolve this difference.</p>
        <p id="para0036">We found no effect of the probiotic supplementation on blood transcriptome in healthy subjects relative to supplementation or during the infection. In the statistical analyses, we found a statistically significant and unexplained cohort effect, however, within cohort results also showed no effect by the probiotic. These findings are consistent with a previous clinical study where Bl-04 or placebo supplementation to an active healthy adult cohort resulted in no difference in blood cytokine profiles, regulatory T cells or clinical chemistry <xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0033" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0034" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, indicating that in healthy subjects with normal immune function and physiology probiotics have no measurable effect on peripheral immune markers. On the other hand, modest cytokine level changes were observed in the nasal washes of subject supplemented with Bl-04 in this and the previous challenge study <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, indicating that the effect of probiotics on mucosal immune function should be investigated further.</p>
        <p id="para0037">This large study in the RV challenge model provided an opportunity for a carefully-controlled assessment of Bl-04 effects on the fecal, throat and nasal microbiome, nasal cytokine profiles and blood transcriptomics. No clinically relevant effects were found. The study did find limited evidence of the effect of the baseline microbiomic profile on clinical, virologic and cytokine responses to the viral infection consistent with but not identical to our previous study <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. These interactions will continue to be evaluated in future studies.</p>
