      "briefSummary": "The investigators aim to evaluate Wellframe, a patient engagement platform that includes a mobile phone application for patients, for its impact on supporting patients who have undergone a percutaneous coronary intervention. The patient mobile app has articles about cardiovascular disease and other health related topics, patient-reported outcomes surveys, physical activity tracking, reminders for medications and upcoming appointments, and two-way communication with a Wellframe Health Advocate. The Wellframe Health Advocate encourages patients to achieve their health goals and stay engaged in their health. The feasibility of onboarding patients to the app and the clinical efficacy of the platform will be evaluated."
