      "briefSummary": "The objective of the trial is to demonstrate superiority of dasiglucagon compared to placebo following a single subcutaneous dose administered to subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) with insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Additionally to compare the glycemic response observed after administration dasiglucagon with that of GlucaGen®.",
      "detailedDescription": "This was a global, multicenter, randomized, parallel, and double-blind clinical trial confirming the efficacy and safety of dasiglucagon for insulin-induced hypoglycemia in patients with T1DM. The patients were randomized 2:1:1 to receive a single subcutaneous 0.6 mg dose of dasiglucagon, placebo, or a 1 mg dose of GlucaGen and followed for at least 28 days after receiving treatment."
