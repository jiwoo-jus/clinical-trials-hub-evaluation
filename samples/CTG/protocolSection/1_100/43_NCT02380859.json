      "briefSummary": "Subjects diagnosed with Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease, between ages of 40-85 inclusive, who have been referred for gait training. Since there can be subtle differences in the brain organization of left- and right-handed people that may influence some of the measurements, right handed participants are preferred. However, a left handed participant may be considered. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups to undergo two weeks of twice-daily sessions. Group A receiving goggles fitted with lenses that distort vision and Group B patients receiving sham goggles",
      "detailedDescription": "The participants will be trained to undergo two daily sessions of visual adaptation at home for 14 consecutive days. For each adaptation session, subject will sit in a chair within reaching distance of a wall or cabinet upon which two dime-sized targets will be placed (one above the other, approximately ten inches apart). While wearing goggles, you will point rapidly to one target then the next, bringing the hand back to his/her torso between each pointing movement. They will be instructed to perform these movements \"as quickly as possible\" for a total of 50 pointing movements in each treatment session. After performing the 50 pointing movements, they will remove their goggles. Throughout the treatment period they will be asked to keep a diary in which they will log the time and duration of each prism adaptation session. At the first and second site visits, participants will be assessed for posture, gait and activities of daily living which will include some questionnaires. Questionnaires will be sent via mail after post-treatment at one week,1 month and 3 months."

Participants will be provided with goggles fitted with prismatic lenses that shift vision upward by 25 dioptres (about 17 degrees).

Participants make 50 pointing movements, as fast and as accurately as possible. Such a procedure induces a downward sensorimotor adaptation of pointing movements.
