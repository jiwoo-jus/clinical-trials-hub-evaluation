      "briefSummary": "In this project the investigators will create computer reminders through user-centered design and will validate the logic using retrospective electronic health record (EHR) data. Then the investigators will test the reminders in primary care clinics to see if they improve treatment of high blood pressure in early chronic kidney disease.\n\nHypothesis: The mean systolic blood pressure of the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population can be decreased by an intervention with three innovative features: 1) methods to synthesize EHR data in order to identify under-diagnosed chronic conditions, 2) iterative improvement in clinical decision support (CDS) content through human factors methods to maximize the \"informativeness\" of the CDS, and 3) the use of behavioral economic principles to create behavioral \"nudges\" internal and external to the CDS.",
      "detailedDescription": "Specific Aim 1: To develop and validate the intervention. Specific Aim 1a: To develop and validate the CDS that will: 1) synthesize existing laboratory tests, medication orders, and vital sign data; 2) increase recognition of CKD, 3) increase recognition of uncontrolled HTN in CKD patients; and 4) deliver evidence-based CKD and hypertension (HTN) management recommendations.\n\nSpecific Aim 1b: To improve the design and content of the CDS, we will use human factors methods, specifically usability testing.\n\nSpecific Aim 1c: To develop a \"wrap-around\" intervention including two behavioral \"nudges\": 1) pre-checked default orders, and 2) an email to obtain commitment from primary care providers (PCPs) to obtain their commitment to follow the CDS recommendations.\n\nAim 1a Study Procedures:\n\nDevelop Rules for Evidence-based Recommendations for HTN in CKD: The investigators will leverage past work that they have done in a study that delivered recommendations based on national guidelines. An example of one of the rules is to determine whether anti-hypertensive agents have been prescribed but are not at highest potency. If so, the CDS will deliver a recommendation to increase the dosage. The investigators will also include one-click access to recommended orders.\n\nImplementation: Before the start of the trial, the CDS will be moved to the Production environment in \"silent mode\" where it will record when it would fire, but it will not be displayed to the user. This step will allow us to validate that the rules are accurately identifying patients and producing the correct recommendations through a chart review. The CDS will be activated in the Production environment on the start date of the clinical trial in Aim 2.\n\nAim 1b Study Procedures:\n\nUsability Test Procedure: Usability testing clinical scenarios will be developed by subject matter experts. Contextual inquiry sessions will be conducted with PCPs and the investigators will ask for feedback on the usability test procedure, as well as content of test scenarios. The goal of Aim 1b is to iteratively improve other important aspects of the CDS that contribute to the overall informativeness of the CDS. The investigators will conduct two rounds of usability testing with PCPs. After each test, the research team and Epic build specialist will make iterative changes to the content of the CDS and layout of information.\n\nQualitative analysis: Qualitative methods will be employed to analyze the data. The transcripts will be organized by task and participant and then quotes will be identified that illustrate a user expectation, frustration, or misinterpretation of content or functionality.\n\nAim 1c Study Procedures:\n\n1. Pre-checked, no-action default: The first nudge will be part of the CDS. The investigators will display the CDS with certain options pre-selected.\n2. Pledge email to obtain commitment from PCPs to follow the CDS recommendations: As a starting point, we need to ensure that PCPs are aware of the clinical practice guidelines. At the beginning of the study, we will send an advertisement email to all PCPs in the network. In addition, as part of the intervention, we will ask intervention arm PCPs to commit to following the recommendations presented to them in the best practices advisory (BPA), or writing their rationale in the CDS if they choose not to. By clicking a link in an email, the intervention PCP will come to a REDCap survey asking them to type their name to pledge to consider the CDS recommendations provided in our BPAs. The control PCPs will receive a control email without the specific details about the study and without the REDCap link.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: To test the effectiveness of the intervention. Specific Aim 2a: To evaluate whether the intervention developed in Aim 1 significantly decreases mean systolic blood pressure in a population of CKD patients with blood pressure \\> 140/90. They will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in a pragmatic, cluster-randomized controlled trial, randomized at the level of the physician. Secondary outcomes will include hypertension-specific process measures, such as treatment intensification.\n\nSpecific Aim 2b: To evaluate whether the intervention improves process measures for quality of CKD care including: annual serum creatinine test, and annual urine albumin test.\n\nSpecific Aim 2 Study Procedures Please see below for detailed description of the clinical trial."
