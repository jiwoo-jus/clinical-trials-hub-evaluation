      "briefSummary": "This study is designed to 1) describe the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V114 and Prevnar 13™ in pneumococcal vaccine-naïve adults at increased risk for pneumococcal disease and to 2) describe the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of PNEUMOVAX™23 when administered 6 months after receipt of either V114 or Prevnar 13™. Increased risk for pneumococcal disease is defined as 1) an underlying medical condition, 2) behavioral habits such as smoking or alcohol use, or 3) living in a community/environment with increased risk of disease transmission."
