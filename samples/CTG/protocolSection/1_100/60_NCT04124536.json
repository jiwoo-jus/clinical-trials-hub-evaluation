      "briefSummary": "The overall objective of this study is to evaluate whether the addition of secondary distribution HIV self-test kits to existing partner notification guidelines increases the proportion of male partners who access facility-based HIV testing services, when compared to the partner notification strategy alone",
      "detailedDescription": "Pregnant women 18 years of age or older who enter antenatal care at Chipata Level 1 Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia will participate.\n\nHIV-positive and HIV-negative pregnant women will be randomized to one of two groups: partner notification alone or partner notification plus secondary distribution of HIV self-test kits. Women will return to the clinic 30 days after enrollment for an exit visit during which time information about their experience with the partner notification strategies will be collected.\n\nA random sample of women and health care workers will also participate in qualitative interviews."
