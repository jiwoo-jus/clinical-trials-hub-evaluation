      "briefSummary": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease affecting millions of people around the world, for which there is unfortunately no cure. Among existing therapies, viscosupplementation, i.e., the injection of hyaluronic acid into the joint, has an established place in the symptomatic treatment of knee OA.\n\nThe present Phase IIb/III aiming to assess the safety and efficacy of JTA-004 is organized in two phases. With results obtained in the first phase the best dose of JTA-004 is determined, and the efficacy of the selected dose will then be confirmed in the second phase."
