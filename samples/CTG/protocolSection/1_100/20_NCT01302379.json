      "briefSummary": "This objective of this randomized controlled trial is to conduct a 2x2 test of a lifestyle intervention and metformin (a drug used to treat diabetes) to investigate how these treatments, alone or in combination, affect biomarkers associated with breast cancer survival. The Reach for Health Study will enroll 340 overweight/obese, postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. After completing the screening process and baseline measures, participants will be randomized in equal numbers to: (1) placebo, (2) metformin, (3) lifestyle intervention and placebo, or (4) lifestyle intervention and metformin. The intervention was powered on the main effects and the planned analyses are to compare: Metformin to Placebo and a separate comparison of Lifestyle intervention to control. The interventions will last for 6 months. Concentrations of circulating biomarkers will be assessed at baseline and 6 months."
