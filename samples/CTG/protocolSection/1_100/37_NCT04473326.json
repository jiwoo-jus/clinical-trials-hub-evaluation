      "briefSummary": "Reinforcement learning is an advanced analytic method that discovers each individual's pattern of responsiveness by observing their actions and then implements a personalized strategy to optimize individuals' behaviors using trial and error. The goal of this pilot study is to develop and test a novel reinforcement learning-enhanced text messaging program to support medication adherence in patients with type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is an optimal condition in which to test this program, as it is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions in the US adult population and requires most patients to be on daily or twice daily doses of medications. This pilot study will be a parallel randomized pragmatic trial comparing medication adherence and clinical outcomes for adults aged 18-84 with type 2 diabetes who are prescribed 1-3 daily oral medications for this disease. Participants will be randomized to one of two arms for the duration of the study period: (1) a reinforcement learning intervention arm with up to daily, tailored text messages based on time-varying treatment-response patterns; or (2) a control arm with up to daily, un-tailored text messages. Our outcomes of interest will be medication adherence, as measured by electronic pill bottles, and HbA1c levels.",
