      "detailedDescription": "Extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, nasal type(ENKTL) accounts for about 6% of all lymphomas in china. Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection is found in all cases of ENKTL and maybe plays an important pathogenetic role.\n\nConventional anthrocycline-based regimens are not preferred to be used in ENKTL because of high p-glycoprotein expression. ORR of L-asparaginase based regimens is about 80% and no salvage regimens are recommended in ENKTL so far after failure of L-asparaginase based regimen.\n\nRecently, a phase II clinical trial result demonstrated high ORR of anti-PD-1 antibody treatment in ENKTL.IBI308, a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) directly against PD-1, is investigated in this phase II Chinese ENKTL clinical trial.\n\nAdditionally the correlation between PD-L1 expression and the response to IBI308 treatment in Chinese ENKTL subjects will also be assessed."
