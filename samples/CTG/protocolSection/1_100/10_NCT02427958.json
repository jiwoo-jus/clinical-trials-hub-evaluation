      "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to assess long-term safety and efficacy of leuprorelin in the treatment of Central Precocious Puberty (CPP).",
      "detailedDescription": "The drug in this study is called leuprorelin. It is administered as a 1 month subcutaneous depot injection. Leuprorelin is used to treat children who have CPP. This study will look at whether leuprorelin can stop early puberty in pre-pubertal children.\n\nThe study will enroll approximately 300 participants. Participants with body weight \\>=20 kg will receive the recommended dose of leuprorelin 3.75 mg subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks for 96 weeks. Participants with body weight \\<20 kg will receive recommended dose of 1.88 mg subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks for 96 weeks.\n\nThis trial will be conducted in China. The overall time to participate in this study is 104 weeks. Participants will make 11 visits to the clinic, and will be followed-up by the physician on a long-term basis until stable puberty is reached."
