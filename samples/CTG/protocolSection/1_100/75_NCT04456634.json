Abstinent female participants must agree to start a double method if they start a sexual relationship with a male during the trial. Female participants must not be planning in vitro fertilisation within the required contraception period.\n\n   Women of non-childbearing potential who will not require contraception during the trial are defined as: surgically sterile (tubal ligation is not considered surgically sterile), post-menopausal (spontaneous amenorrhoea for ≥12 months, or spontaneous amenorrhoea for 6-12 months and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) ≥40 IU/mL; either should be together with the absence of oral contraceptive use for \\>12 months).\n\n   Male participants who have, or may have female sexual partners during the course of the study must agree to use a double method of contraception including condom plus diaphragm, or condom plus stable insertable (implant or IUD), injectable, transdermal or combination oral contraceptive by the female partner, from the time of informed consent through to EOS. Abstinent male participants must agree to start a double method if they begin a sexual relationship with a female during the trial, and through to EOS. Male participants with female partners that are surgically sterile or post-menopausal, or male participants who have undergone sterilisation and have had testing to confirm the success of the sterilisation, may also be included and will not be required to use above described methods of contraception.\n\n   Regulations\n8.

History of an episode of mild/moderate depression lasting more than 6 months that required pharmacological therapy and/or psychotherapy within the last 5 years; or any episode of major depression. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) will be used as a validated tool for the assessment of depression at screening. In addition to the conditions listed above, individuals with a score of 20 or more on the BDI-II and/or a response of 1, 2 or 3 for item 9 of this inventory (related to suicidal ideation) will not be eligible for participation. These individuals will be referred to a general practitioner or medical specialist as appropriate. Individuals with a BDI-II score of 17 to 19 may be enrolled at the discretion of an Investigator if they do not have a history of the psychiatric conditions mentioned in this criterion and their mental state is not considered to pose additional risk to the health of the individual or to the execution of the trial and interpretation of the data gathered.\n13.
