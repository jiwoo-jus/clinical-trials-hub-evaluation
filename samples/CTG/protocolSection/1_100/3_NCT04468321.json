      "briefSummary": "This will be a prospective multi-center, randomized, controlled trial of 150 patients conducted to assess the impact of individual use of the Apple Watch compared to the Withings Move on patient-reported and clinical outcomes at 6 months and up to 1 year.",
      "detailedDescription": "This is a a randomized, controlled trial to determine the impact of the Apple Watch Series 6 compared to the Withings Move on both patient-reported outcomes and clinical utilization over 6 months and up to 1 year. Our research method will employ a patient-centered health data sharing platform (called Hugo) for real-world surveillance of outcomes in 150 total patients after they receive elective direct current cardioversion (DCCV) or catheter ablation for treatment of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Patients will be enrolled at each of 3 clinical sites: Yale-New Haven Hospital, the Mayo Clinic, and Duke Health. Half of the patients will be randomized to receive the Apple Watch Series 6, while half will receive a control device (Withings Move). Patients will then be queried about specific symptoms related to atrial fibrillation and medication adherence monthly. This project will provide novel and needed post-market data about the Apple Watch Series 6 ECG and irregular rhythm detection notification features and, on a larger scale, help delineate the impact of an innovative digital health technology on real-world patient outcomes.\n\nSpecific Aim 1: To assess the impact of using the Apple Watch ECG and irregular rhythm notification features on patient-reported outcomes and clinical utilization after patients receive cardioversion or catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: To determine the accuracy of the Apple Watch ECG compared to physician interpretation of 12-lead ECGs obtained in routine clinical care."
