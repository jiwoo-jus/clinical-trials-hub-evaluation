      "briefSummary": "The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of secukinumab 150 mg compared to placebo in the early management (Baseline to Week 8) of spinal pain, disease activity, fatigue, and predictability of disease flares in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) who had an inadequate response to prior non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This study also explored the efficacy and safety of secukinumab 300 mg compared to secukinumab 150 mg from Week 8 to Week 24 in order to assess the potential additional benefits of dose escalation in patients with axSpA.",
      "detailedDescription": "The study consisted of 2 treatment periods: a double-blind, placebo-controlled period from Baseline to Week 8 (Treatment Period 1) and a double-blind secukinumab treatment period from Week 8 to Week 24 (Treatment Period 2).\n\nAt Baseline (Treatment Period 1), patients were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to either secukinumab 150 mg (Group A) or placebo (Group B). At Week 8 (Treatment Period 2), patients were re-randomized and re-assigned respectively to 1 of 5 treatment arms to receive either secukinumab 150 mg or secukinumab 300 mg.\n\nPatients assigned to secukinumab 150 mg (Group A) at Baseline who were responders (i.e. spinal pain score \\< 4) at Week 8 continued on the same dose until Week 24 under 1 treatment arm (Arm A1). Patients assigned to secukinumab 150 mg at Baseline who were non-responders at Week 8 were re-randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms: secukinumab 150 mg (Arm A2) or secukinumab 300 mg (Arm A3) from Week 8 to Week 24.\n\nSimilarly, patients assigned to placebo (Group B) at Baseline were re-randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms: secukinumab 150 mg (Arm B1) or secukinumab 300 mg (Arm B2) from Week 8 until Week 24."
