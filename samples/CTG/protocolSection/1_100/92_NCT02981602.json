Liver biopsy (i.e., Metavir Score F4) within 2 years of Screening, or\n  2. Fibroscan \\> 12 KPa, within 12 months of Screening, or\n  3. AST-to-Platelet Index (APRI) \\> 2 and Fibrosure result \\> 0.7 within 12 months of Screening For patients without a test for cirrhosis in the above timeframes, Fibroscan, or APRI and Fibrosure, may be performed during the screening period to rule out cirrhosis\n* History of liver failure as evidenced by ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and/or gastric or esophageal varices\n* History of liver disease other than Hepatitis B\n* Co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or hepatitis D virus (HDV)\n* BMI \\> 35 kg/m2\n* History of, or suspected presence of vasculitis\n* Received solid organ or bone marrow transplant\n* Currently taking, or took within 3 months of Screening, any immunosuppressing drugs (e.g., prednisone)\n* Diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma or suspected hepatocellular carcinoma as evidenced by screening alpha-fetoprotein ≥ 200 ng/mL. If the screening alpha-fetoprotein is ≥ 50 ng/mL and \\< 200 ng/mL, the absence of liver mass must be documented by imaging within 6 months before randomization\n* Clinically-significant abnormalities aside from chronic HBV infection in medical history (e.g., previous acute coronary syndrome within 6 months of Screening, major surgery within 3 months of Screening, uncontrolled diabetes) or physical examination\n* History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy\n* History of extrahepatic disorders possibly related to HBV immune complexes (e.g., glomerulonephritis, polyarteritis nodosa)\n* History of excess alcohol consumption within 6 months of Screening\n* History of drug abuse or dependence, or recreational use of drugs: within 3 months of Screening for soft drugs (such as marijuana) and within 1-year of Screening for hard drugs (such as cocaine, phencyclidine \\[PCP\\])",
