The main objective in conducting this research is to collect data from patients who use the AHCL system at home, at work, at school and everywhere else. Subjects will use 670G 4.0 system with Guardian Sensor 3 (GS3) during study period, and will be allowed to participate in continued access phase, and use 670G 4.0 system with GS3 and 780G system with Guardian 4 Sensor (G4S)."
