      "briefSummary": "This RCT will test a new electronic health record module to improve guideline-compliant care of older adults with diabetes. The module incorporates effective behavioral economics (BE) principles to improve the degree to which care of older adults is compliant with Choosing Wisely (CW) guidelines; this generally involves less aggressive targets for HbA1c, and reductions of medications other than metformin. The implementation of the module is triggered by patient scheduling and medication prescribing in EPIC. The BE principles include suggesting alternatives to medications, requiring justification, setting of appropriate default order sets, and incorporation of anchoring and checklists to guide behavior."
