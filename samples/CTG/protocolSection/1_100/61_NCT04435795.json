      "briefSummary": "The CONTAIN (CiclesOnide cliNical TriAl covId-19 treatmeNt) is a randomized control study of ciclesonide vs placebo for mild covid-19 disease. The need for potential therapy for COVID-19 patients is urgent. Ciclesonide has shown encouraging in vitro results, is easy to be used and is readily available. It has a low rate of side effects and few interactions with other drugs. It is unusual to use an inhaled steroid drug for COVID-19 but there has been new data suggesting steroids may have an antiviral effect in addition to an anti-inflammatory effect. Investigators propose to use inhaled and nasal ciclesonide to stop viral replication in the nose and airways. Investigators hope this will accelerate recovery from COVID-19 illness in individuals who are not admitted to hospital at time of diagnosis of COVID-19."
