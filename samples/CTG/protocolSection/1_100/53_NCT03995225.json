Smokers will wear a smartband to detect and notify them of smoking for 21 days and obtain individual smoking profiles; detected smoking will then trigger a \"mindful smoking\" exercise for the next 7 days leading up to their quit date at 30 days; after which another mindfulness exercise (\"RAIN\": recognize, accept, investigate and note cravings rather than smoke) will be delivered prior to each predicted smoking episode according to their individual smoking profile for 30 days post-quit."
