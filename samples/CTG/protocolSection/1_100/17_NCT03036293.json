      "briefSummary": "The purposes of this study are:\n\n* To further examine the efficacy and safety of Tenoten® in the treatment of anxiety in patients with somatoform, stress-related and other neurotic disorders.\n* To compare the efficacy of two dosing regimens of Tenoten® (4 tablets daily vs.8 tablets daily, both for 12 weeks) in the treatment of anxiety in patients with somatoform, stress-related and other neurotic disorders.",
      "detailedDescription": "Design: an international, a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel group placebo-controlled trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of study treatment.\n\nThe study will enroll outpatient subjects of both genders aged 18-45 years with verified diagnoses of somatoform, stress-related and other neurotic disorders (F43, F45, F48) and signs of clinically relevant anxiety according to The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS).\n\nAfter signing the informed consent form to participate in the clinical study the subject will be interviewed (complaints, medical history, concomitant therapy) and objective examination will be performed; the subject will fill HADS scale. The severity of anxiety at screening should be ≥ 11 according to HADS. If the subject meets inclusion criteria and has no exclusion criteria he/she will be enrolled into the study. The investigator will determine the severity of anxiety using НАМ-А scale; the subject will fill EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. At Visit 1 (Day 1) the subject will be randomized into one of the treatment groups:\n\n* Group 1: Tenoten® at 2 tablets twice daily (4 tablets/day);\n* Group 2: Placebo at 2 tablets twice daily (4 tablets/day);\n* Group 3: Tenoten® at 2 tablets 4 daily (8 tablets/day).\n* Group 4: Placebo at 2 tablets 4 daily (8 tablets/day). The first dose should be administered at Visit 1 after the visit procedures are completed. Further administration of the study product will be made according to the dosing scheme. The subject will administer the study product and will be followed for 12 weeks during which additional three visits will be made. At Visit 2 (Week 4), Visit 3 (Week 8) and Visit 4 (Week 12) the physician will record patients' complaints and physical examination data, fill HAM-A scale, check the study and concomitant therapy, assess treatment safety and patient compliance with the study treatment. At the final Visit 4 the subject will fill EQ-5D-3L questionnaire and the investigator will fill the Clinical Global Impression Scale Efficacy Index (CGI-EI).\n\nSubjects will be allowed to take symptomatic therapy and medications for their co-morbidities during the study, except for the medicines listed in \"Prohibited therapy\"."
