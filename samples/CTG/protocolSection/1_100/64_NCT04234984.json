      "briefSummary": "Management of chronic knee pain remains a challenge to the treating physician. A radiofrequency treatment of the genicular nerves is a not yet established but promising technique. This procedure is minimal invasive and has few adverse events. For these reasons it can be advantageous and fulfilling the unmet needs of these chronic knee pain patients warranting further research of its efficacy.\n\nTo investigate this efficacy, all patients treated with radiofrequency ablation in the multidisciplinary chronic pain center between 1 September 2017 and 31 December 2019 with exclusion of patients with chronic widespread pain, will be retrospectively analyzed in a single-center cohort.",
      "detailedDescription": "This project has as primary objective the evaluation of treatment success of a conventional radiofrequency treatment of the genicular nerves in patients diagnosed with chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee or persistent post-surgical pain (PPSP) at six weeks post treatment. Secondary objectives are evaluation of treatment effect at a third time point at the end of the inclusion period, subgroup analysis of treatment success based on indication to treatment, evaluation of subjective functional improvement and change in analgesics, estimation of the duration of effect of the treatment and adverse events.\n\nThis study includes all patients treated with radiofrequency ablation in the multidisciplinary chronic pain center in Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg, Campus Sint-Barbara between 1 September 2017 and 31 December 2019 with exclusion of patients with chronic widespread pain.\n\nThe main study outcome is the proportion of patients with a global perceived effect of at least 50% at 6 weeks post intervention. Secondary outcomes include reduction in pain intensity, measured by Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) at six weeks and at a third time point, global perceived effect at a third time point, subjective change in physical functioning, duration effect of the treatment, use of strong opioids, and adverse events."
