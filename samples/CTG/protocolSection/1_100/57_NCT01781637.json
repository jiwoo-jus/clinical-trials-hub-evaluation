      "briefSummary": "The investigators will perform a double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial with Xolair (omalizumab) at four centers to safely and rapidly desensitize patients with severe peanut allergy. The investigators will determine if pretreatment with anti-IgE mAb (Xolair/omalizumab) can greatly reduce allergic reactions and allow for faster and safer desensitization.",
      "detailedDescription": "36 subjects will receive Xolair, and 8 subjects will receive placebo. The study will occur at 4 sites: Boston Children's Hospital, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Stanford University and Lurie Children's Hospital.\n\nPatients will be pre-treated with Xolair or placebo before rapid oral peanut desensitization. Patients will continue to receive Xolair during the 8 subsequent weeks of desensitization, receiving their final dose of Xolair one week after reaching the highest tolerated dose of peanut."
