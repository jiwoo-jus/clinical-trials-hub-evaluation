      "briefSummary": "To explore in a pilot randomized clinical trial, the impact of Home Blood Pressure Monitoring with patient directed information as compared to usual care on the postoperative management of blood pressure.",
      "detailedDescription": "The intervention and control groups will be defined by, 1) preoperative home blood pressure monitoring with a detailed report sent to the patient, and 2) usual standard of care including a suggestion during the pre-operative clinic appointment to follow up with Primary Care. Both groups will receive a brief questionnaire about their blood pressure treatment and medication adherence. We will examine the rate of primary care follow-up and changes in hypertension treatment at 60 days post-operative, through a telephone call. This information, along with information regarding patient acceptance of the intervention will be used to inform the design of a future clinical trial powered to outcomes, including follow-up visits and blood pressure management."
