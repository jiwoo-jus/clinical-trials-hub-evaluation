      "briefSummary": "Text2Connect (T2C) proposes to test a text-based intervention designed to improve engagement with mental health treatment.",
      "detailedDescription": "To enhance outcomes for transition-age youth with mental health disorders during the vulnerable period that occurs during their first several months of college, the investigators propose an automated TM intervention, \"Text to Connect\" (T2C), that aims to increase mental health self-efficacy through psychoeducation, self-monitoring of symptoms and stressors, and cues to action for college-bound youth.\n\nAssignment of Interventions:\n\nThe study will utilize block randomization whereby 2/3 of participants will be randomly assigned to receive T2C, and 1/3 to receive PE. Blocks will balance the groups on site (CCP versus STAR/CABS). A 2:1 randomization scheme will randomize 50 youth to either receive T2C (n=30) or a link to brief psychoeducational videos about mental health (PE; n=20). All participants will then complete a brief battery of self-report assessments online at baseline and again monthly through month 4. Youth randomized to receive PE will receive a text message with the link to the webpage with the psychoeducational videos. Youth randomized to receive T2C will be onboarded and initiate the TM intervention that sends automated prompts at minimum monthly through month 4.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nAim 1. To examine the feasibility of T2C for transition-age youth with psychiatric disorders (n=3 clinics, 50 adolescents). Youth randomized to receive T2C will:\n\nHypothesis 1a. engage with T2C at high rates (\\>70% response rate to SMS prompts).\n\nHypothesis 1b. report high levels of satisfaction (\\>70% satisfaction) and usability with T2C.\n\nAim 2. To examine the impact of T2C versus PE on mental health self-efficacy, symptoms and functioning, and treatment engagement. Over 4 months, youth who receive T2C, as compared with youth who receive PE, will report:\n\nHypothesis 2a (Primary). Greater mental health self-efficacy Hypothesis 2b (Secondary). Lower symptom severity and greater psychosocial functioning Hypothesis 2c (Secondary). Higher rates of follow-through with mental health services"
