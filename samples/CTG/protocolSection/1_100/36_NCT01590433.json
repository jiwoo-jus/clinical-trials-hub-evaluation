      "briefSummary": "The investigators are conducting a study that will investigate the possible mechanisms of weight loss associated with exenatide treatment and the metabolic characteristics of high responders (i.e. subjects who achieve greater than 5% weight loss) to exenatide treatment. The investigators will also examine the magnitude and duration of weight loss among a cohort of high responders over 52 weeks of treatment, and at 3 and 6 months following treatment.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nThe mechanisms of weight loss with exenatide are not fully understood, and weight loss responses to exenatide are highly variable, possibly reflecting distinct metabolic parameters. By identifying and following a group of obese women who lose greater than 5% body weight after short-term exenatide treatment, the investigators can gain insights into the possible mechanisms of weight loss and assess long-term weight loss with this pharmacotherapeutic intervention.",
      "detailedDescription": "Primary Outcomes\n\nThe primary objectives of this study is:\n\n\\- To investigate possible mechanisms and patterns of weight loss with exenatide treatment, especially among individuals who have robust early weight loss (greater than 5% weight loss in 12 weeks) with exenatide.\n\nSecondary Outcomes\n\nOur secondary objective is to identify metabolic characteristics that predict robust response to exenatide treatment.\n\nOutcome measurements:\n\n* Weight\n* Body composition\n* Resting energy expenditure (REE)\n* Mixed meal test\n* Thermic effect of food\n* Serum metabolic parameters\n* Hunger/Nausea/Satiety visual analog scales (VAS)\n* Physical activity monitoring\n\nStudy Population\n\nThe study population will be generally healthy, non-diabetic women age 18-70 years with BMI 28-48 kg/m\\^2."
