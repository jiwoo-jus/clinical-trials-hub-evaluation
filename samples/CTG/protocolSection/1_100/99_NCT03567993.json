      "briefSummary": "The mHealth Messaging to Motivate Quitline Use and Quitting, or \"M2Q2\" study, is a collaborative research project for a mobile health intervention designed to motivate smoking cessation and encourage access to counseling. The study is for men and women smokers in Vietnam's Red River Delta region who are 18 years of age or older.\n\nThe primary hypothesis is that smokers in the M2Q2 intervention will have higher rates of smoking cessation, compared with the comparison group.",
      "detailedDescription": "The specific aims of the M2Q2 study are:\n\nAim 1: In collaboration with the Institute of Population, Health, and Development (PHAD) in Vietnam, adapt a current, effective messaging system to Vietnam. The messaging system will:\n\n1. Motivate smokers to quit smoking, using tailored messages adapted to be culturally relevant.\n2. Encourage smokers to accept counseling services from the Quitline, and take advantage of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) that will be provided by the Quitline to those willing to quit.\n\nAim 2: To engage with the Quitline, providing additional training in tobacco cessation counseling for those ready to quit, and motivational interventions for those not yet ready to quit.\n\nAim 3: To evaluate the impact of the messaging system on: access to the Quitline, use of nicotine replacement therapy, increase in self-efficacy, and six-month biochemically verified smoking cessation.\n\nThe study will be conducted in the Red River Delta Region, an agriculturally rich and densely populated area in northern Vietnam. Four communes (Viet Hung, Binh Minh, Tan Viet and Bach Sam) located in four different districts in the Hung Yen province will be included in the M2Q2 study, based on their general representativeness to the rural northern Vietnamese population and because the investigators have developed infrastructure to support technology-assisted behavioral interventions through community health centers (CHCs) in these communes. Each of the selected communes satisfy the following criteria: (1) have a community health center with a medical doctor; (2) are not currently participating in other studies for smoking cessation; and (3) have a minimum geographic separation of 12 kilometers (7 miles) from all other study communes to minimize possible contamination.\n\nRecruitment and retention of study participants will be conducted by both CHC staff and community health workers. The investigators will recruit men and women, and plan for recruiting 15% women. The investigators will plan to recruit smokers regardless of their readiness to quit. Participants will not be compensated, other than being provided a cellphone if they currently do not own one.\n\nThe duration of an individual subject's participation in the study is 6 months (baseline survey, texting system, quitline data, and the 6-month follow-up survey). The duration anticipated to enroll all study subjects is 2 years, 2 months. The estimated date for the investigators to complete this study with primary analyses is the middle of year 5.\n\nThe main dependent variable is patient tobacco cessation rate (quit rate) at six months. The investigators will biochemically verify smoking status at baseline and at six months. The secondary outcome measure is self-efficacy. The investigators will administer an 12-item questionnaire (SEQ-12) to measure self-efficacy at baseline and at six months."
