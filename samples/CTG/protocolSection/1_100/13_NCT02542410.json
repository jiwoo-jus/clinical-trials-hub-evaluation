The arithmetic mean of the seven interference items is used as a measure of pain interference (i.e., how much a participant's pain interferes with her ability to complete activities of daily living and functioning). The score on the pain interference subscale ranges from 0-70. Higher scores are worse outcomes.\n\nOutcome measure calculated as the value at 6 months minus the value at baseline",
