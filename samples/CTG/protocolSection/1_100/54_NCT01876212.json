      "briefSummary": "Current therapeutic approaches available for patients with advanced-stage melanoma remain inadequate, and existing approaches including those involving immunotherapy with cytokines and/or targeted strategies have resulted in disappointingly low rates of durable and complete responses. Correcting immune dysfunction in advanced-stage melanoma patients using tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as dasatinib is proposed to relicense the patient's immune system to respond optimally to specific immunization. The integration of antigens expressed by tumor-associated blood vessel cells provides a means to selectively target the genetically-/antigenically-heterogeneous population of tumor cells in the advanced-stage melanoma patient.\n\nThis is a single-center, prospective randomized Phase 2 trial evaluating the activity, safety and immune effects of dasatinib given in combination with an autologous type-1 polarized Dendritic Cell (αDC1) vaccine. The current trial represents a randomized Phase 2 study to determine the activity and safety of intradermal (id) administration of αDC1s loaded with a mixture of six TBVA-derived peptides at the time of, or immediately after, an initial therapy cycle with the TKI dasatinib.\n\nDasatinib will be administered at the standard dose and schedule recommended by the FDA (70 mg BID). The autologous type-I DC vaccine will be administered either prior to, or concomitant with, the initiation of dasatinib administration. All patients will receive dasatinib at a starting dose of 70 mg twice daily by mouth in the outpatient setting approximately every 12 hours, at the same time each day.\n\nThe DC vaccine will be administered by a single intradermal injection of approximately 10e7 cells, with all the DCs being administered on days 1 and 15 of every cycle on an outpatient basis in the University of Pittsburgh Clinical and Translational Research Center (UPCI-CTRC).\n\nPatients on Arm A will start dasatinib administration on cycle 2, day 1 (week 5), while those patients in Arm B will start dasatinib administration on cycle 1, day 1 (week 1).\n\nMen and women at least 18 years of age must be HLA-A2+ and have histologically confirmed melanoma that is metastatic (Stage IV) or unresectable Stage IIIB/C and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective.\n\nNote: The outcome measures and time frames (previously) described in the PRS protocol record have been revised and articulated in the results section, to more accurately describe and represent the stated per-protocol investigations and endpoints, quantitatively."

Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum) within 7 days prior to treatment. A pregnancy test is not required for registration. Women who have not menstruated for more than 2 years will be considered postmenopausal, thus not of childbearing potential.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\n* Patients with documented c-KIT mutations.\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Patients with known active brain metastases should be excluded.
