      "briefSummary": "This study aims to determine whether a combination a first-line antidepressant plus \"RT2CK17\" in a capsule relative to a first-line antidepressant plus placebo in a capsule results in higher rates of medication adherence in individuals with moderate to severe depression. In this double-blind randomized placebo controlled trial, 100 individuals with a Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (QIDS-SR) scale score ≥ 14 will be enrolled to participate in an 8 week treatment study. Participants will be randomized with a 1-1 ratio to receive 5 milligrams (mg) \"RT2CK17\" + 10 mg escitalopram or placebo + 10 mg escitalopram to be taken orally once per day. Participants will undergo a 3 hour baseline evaluation visit at week 0, two 30-minute office visits (week 2 and 4), one 60-minute office visit (week 8) and three 5-minute phone calls (weeks 1, 3, and 6) during which clinical assessments and measures will be obtained. The trial is designed with two stages: 20 participants in Stage 1 will be used to estimate the adherence effect size; Stage 2 is designed with an interim analysis to test our hypotheses."
