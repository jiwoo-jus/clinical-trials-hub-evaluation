      "briefSummary": "Determine the effect of twice-daily chlorhexidine oral rinse on oral and lung microbiota biomass in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with chronic bronchitis. Our primary outcome will be to compare the microbiota biomass (number of bacteria as measured by 16S rRNA copy number) of induced sputum and the oral cavity before and after 8 weeks of twice-daily chlorhexidine oral rinse (n=25) compared to controls (n=25) using qPCR and next-generation sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene comparing total bacterial biomass",
      "detailedDescription": "Our hypothesis is that 8 weeks of chlorhexidine oral rinse will decrease microbiota biomass compared to baseline and those on placebo. Furthermore, we hypothesize that chlorhexidine treatment will: i) decrease lung and oral microbiota diversity; ii) alter microbiota taxonomic composition in the lung and oral cavity; iii) decrease systemic inflammation as measured by blood high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), fibrinogen and leukocyte count; and iv) demonstrate a trend towards improvement in respiratory health status as measured by the Breathlessness, Cough, and Sputum Scale (BCSS)\\[1, 2\\] and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).\n\nSubaim 1: Determine if chlorhexidine alters the lung and oral rinse microbiota diversity and taxonomic composition. Our hypothesis is that chlorhexidine oral rinse will decrease the diversity (Shannon and inverse Simpson diversity indices) and taxonomic composition of both oral and lung microbiota compared to those on placebo as determined by next-generation sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene.\n\nSubaim 2: Determine the impact of chlorhexidine on systemic inflammation. Our hypothesis is that the decrease in lung microbiota biomass is associated with a decrease in systemic inflammation as measured by blood hsCRP, fibrinogen, and leukocyte count.\n\nSubaim 3: Determine if respiratory symptoms associate with the lung microbiota biomass. Our hypothesis is that chlorhexidine will demonstrate improved respiratory health status as measured by the BCSS and SGRQ."
