      "briefSummary": "The purpose of the study is to evaluate the dose-response efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD5718 in participants with proteinuric chronic kidney disease.",
      "detailedDescription": "The study will be conducted in approximately 118 study centers across 12 countries. The overall study period will be around 28 weeks. Approximately 632 participants comprising of 67% diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and 33% non-DKD participants will be enrolled. After a screening period of up to 4 weeks, the participants will be randomised in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive one of the doses of AZD5718 and/or placebo for the first 12 weeks (Day 85 \\[treatment period 1\\]), with an add-on therapy of 8 weeks of dapagliflozin for all participants from Week 12 to 20 (Day 85 to 141 \\[treatment period 2\\]). Only participants still taking their assigned treatment from treatment period 1 will progress to treatment period 2. Any participant with urine albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) \\< 30 mg/g at Week 12 will be excluded from treatment period 2. The eligibility check to enter treatment period 2 will be done at Visit 7 (Week 12) using the last available urine ACR result. The final analysis will be done after all participants have completed follow-up period of up to 4 weeks. The expected total study duration, including the Screening Period, for each participant will be at least 28 weeks."
