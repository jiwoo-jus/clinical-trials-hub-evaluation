      "briefSummary": "This trial was designed to assess safety and preliminary efficacy of oral doses of iOWH032 on diarrhea output and clinical symptoms after a cholera challenge in healthy adult participants.",
      "detailedDescription": "The study consists of a screening phase, an inpatient containment period with challenge with Vibrio cholerae on Day 1 followed by treatment with iOWH032 or placebo and a post-challenge observation period until discharge, an outpatient follow-up period of at least 28 days, and a final follow-up (by telephone) 6 months post-challenge (Day 180) for the collection of serious adverse events.\n\nParticipants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either iOWH032 500 mg every 8 hours for three days or matching placebo. Blinded therapeutic dosing will start at the onset of diarrhea or by 48 hours after ingesting the challenge inoculum of V. cholerae. The observation and management of cholera diarrhea and symptomatology will occur on an inpatient isolation research ward over a duration of approximately 11 days, including a three-day course of antibiotics to treat all participants prior to discharge from the inpatient unit."
