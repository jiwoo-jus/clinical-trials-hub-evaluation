      "briefSummary": "The study will compare the efficacy and safety of treatment with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) versus paclitaxel in Asian, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive participants with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have progressed after failure of any combination chemotherapy containing a platinum and a fluoropyrimidine agent.\n\nThe primary study hypotheses are that pembrolizumab prolongs Overall Survival (OS) compared to paclitaxel and that pembrolizumab prolongs Progression-free Survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) assessed by blinded central radiologists' review compared to paclitaxel.",
      "detailedDescription": "Once the participant has achieved the study objective or the study has ended, the participant will be discontinued from the study and may be enrolled in an extension study to continue protocol-defined assessments and treatment. Enrollment in the extension study will be conditional on participant consent. Treatment with pembrolizumab or paclitaxel will continue until documented disease progression, unacceptable adverse event(s), intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, investigator's decision to discontinue the participant, participant withdraws consent, pregnancy of the participant, participant receives 35 administrations (approximately 2 years) of pembrolizumab, or administrative reasons requiring cessation of treatment."
