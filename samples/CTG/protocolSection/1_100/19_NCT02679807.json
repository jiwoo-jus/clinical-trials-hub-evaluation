      "briefSummary": "This is a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a probiotic (Bl-04) on the occurrence of rhinovirus-associated common cold illness in the experimental rhinovirus challenge model. A previous study documented that Bl-04 has significant effects on the innate immune response in the nose and this study will be powered to assess whether these effects translate into a demonstrable clinical benefit. Volunteers will be given Bl-04 or placebo for 28 days then challenged with rhinovirus. The primary analysis will be on the proportion of volunteers who develop a rhinovirus associated illness in the two treatment groups."
