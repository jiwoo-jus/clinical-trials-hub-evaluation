      "briefSummary": "Participation in community activities allows children to meet friends, learns new skills, fosters independence, and paves the foundation for lifelong health. High rates of community participation restriction have been reported in children with developmental disabilities who are aged six years or below, a critical developmental period.\n\nOccupational Performance Coaching (OPC), grounded in self-determination theory, is aimed to facilitate children's participation in life situations through coaching parents. Studies have shown that OPC is effective to promote children's activity participation. However, there have been limited randomized controlled trials demonstrating the efficacy of OPC, especially with the specific focus on children's community participation.\n\nThe investigators propose to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial of OPC for parents of preschool children with developmental disabilities in Hong Kong, and to test its initial efficacy on promoting children's community participation.",
      "detailedDescription": "Parent coaching emerges as a preferred approach for enhancing performance and participation of children with developmental disabilities (DD), but limited clinical trials examine its effects on community participation. Thus, this study aims to evaluate whether parent coaching, specifically using Occupational Performance Coaching (OPC), enhances community participation among young children with DD.\n\nYoung children with DD will be recruited from preschool-rehabilitation services offered by three non-governmental organisations in Hong Kong. Ethics approval has been obtained from the Human Subjects Ethics Sub-committee at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.\n\nA two-arm parallel, double-blind design will be adopted for the study. Fifty parents of young children with DD will be randomly assigned to the intervention group (i.e., OPC) or the active control group (i.e., parents' consultation). Four assessment points will be scheduled throughout the study: 5-6 weeks before intervention (Time 0), 1-2 weeks before intervention (Time 1), 1-2 weeks after intervention (Time 2), and 8-9 weeks after the intervention (Time 3). Randomisation allocation will be completed at Time 1. Participants and independent outcome assessors will not be informed about the groupings.\n\nEach parent will receive a maximum of eight coaching sessions or consultations. The primary outcome will be children's community participation as assessed through parent-report measures at baseline, pre-intervention, post-intervention, and an 8-week follow-up. Children in both groups will continue to receive their usual care, which may include services such as occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and speech therapy on a weekly/monthly basis, depending on their individual needs.\n\nIndependent t-test and chi-square statistics will be used to test for between-group baseline differences. To evaluate the effect of OPC on each outcome measure, repeated-measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) by controlling for baseline values per outcome will be used. Post-hoc analyses will be performed when the main effects were significant. Statistical significance is set at p \\< 0.05. Estimates of effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for each outcome measure."

During the exploration of the options for a particular goal, collaborative performance analysis is used. The coach follows the four steps to (a) identify parents' perception of what currently happens, (b) identify what they would like to happen, (c) explore barriers and bridges to the desired performance, and (d) identify their needs for taking actions to achieve goals. Parents are guided to find strategies to facilitate their child's performance to support goal achievement.",
