The primary objectives of the study are to characterize the incidence of treatment emergent sinus bradycardia, treatment emergent sinus tachycardia, or other treatment emergent cardiac arrhythmias after administration of sugammadex and to evaluate the general safety of sugammadex in a population of ASA Class 3 and 4 participants in a surgical setting."
