      "briefSummary": "Despite the psychosocial difficulties common among young adults with autism spectrum disorders(ASD), little to no evidence-based social skills interventions exist for this population. Using a randomized controlled trial(RCT) design, the current study tested the effectiveness of an evidence-based, caregiver-assisted social skills intervention known as PEERS for Young Adults with high-functioning young adults with ASD using self- and caregiver-report measures.",
      "detailedDescription": "1. Both the case and the control of this study shall be a high-functioning group consisting of young adults aged 18 to 35 years with ASD and an IQ of 70 or over. A total of 48 young adults will be recruited and divided into two groups. One will be the case group and the other will be the waitlist control group. And the study will be going on 3 institutions. Again, the case will be divided into two sub-groups of ten and carry out this new developed program for both parents and young adult. That is, the program will be carried out two times in each of both groups. The waitlist control group will be allowed to receive personal outpatient treatment and general therapeutic intervention from community while waiting.\n2. Effects of the program will be measured both at the case and the control by using a scale which measures social interaction, quality of peer relationship, disposition of autism and social anxiety. Equal assessments for both the case and the control will be conducted right before the beginning of the program and right after the completion of the program and four months after the completion of the program."
