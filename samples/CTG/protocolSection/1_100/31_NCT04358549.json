Subjects will be randomized within their study site and stratified by the severity of their disease to receive either favipiravir + standard of care (SOC) or SOC alone.\n\nThe dose regimen will be 1800 mg favipiravir bis in die (BID) plus SOC or SOC alone on Day 1 followed by 1000 mg BID favipiravir (800 mg BID for subjects with Child-Pugh A liver impairment) plus SOC or SOC for the next 13 days.\n\nThe study will have 14 days of treatment and 46 days of follow-up.\n\nApproximately 50 patients are planned to be enrolled in the trial at approximately 8 study sites in the US."
