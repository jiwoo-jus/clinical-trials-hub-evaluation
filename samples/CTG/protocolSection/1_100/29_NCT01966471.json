Following surgery and anthracycline-based chemotherapy, participants will receive either trastuzumab emtansine at a dose of 3.6 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) and pertuzumab at a dose of 420 milligrams (mg) intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (q3w) or trastuzumab at a dose of 6 mg/kg and pertuzumab at a dose of 420 mg IV q3w in combination with a taxane."
