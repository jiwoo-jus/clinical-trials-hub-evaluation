      "briefSummary": "The goal of this R21 grant is to test the feasibility of a theoretically informed, LGBTQ-affirming intervention (Proud \\& Empowered; P\\&E). Although LGBTQ adolescents experience disparities in behavioral health outcomes compared to their heterosexual peers, interventions are scarce. For example, LGBTQ adolescents are 3 to 4 times more likely to meet criteria for an internalizing disorder and 2 to 5 times more likely to meet criteria for externalizing disorders than their heterosexual peers. Our intervention seeks to address disparate behavioral health problems such as depression, anxiety and trauma symptomology. Our goal will be achieved by completing two specific aims: 1) Assess the feasibility, including recruitment, enrollment, fidelity of service delivery, satisfaction, safety, and retention, of the intervention in a randomized control trial with four schools, 2) Obtain preliminary estimates of intervention effects on key behavioral health symptoms for LGBTQ youth and school climate (norms, attitudes, beliefs, behaviors) at the school level in preparation for a larger efficacy trial. This innovative R21 application brings together a team of nationally recognized minority stress and prevention science experts and responds to a nationally established public health need for research from the Institute of Medicine, the National Institutes of Health, and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force."
