      "briefSummary": "Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has been proposed as a rescue therapy in critically ill COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study is to determine whether combining TPE with convalescent plasma (CVP) transfusion early during the intensive care unit (ICU) stay, improves survival among this heterogeneous population.",
      "detailedDescription": "This single centre prospective, non-randomised controlled trial will be conducted in an 8 bed COVID-19 ICU and will include patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring ICU monitoring and therapy. 19 patients will be treated performing TPE followed by CVP transfusion while for 19 patients will receive standard treatment according to hospital protocols. TPE will be initiated during the first 24 hours after ICU admission, followed immediately by transfusion of CVP. The primary endpoint is survival at 30 days. Secondary endpoints include assessing the evolution of biomarkers, such as the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio (P/F ratio), C reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ferritin at the 7-day follow-up."
