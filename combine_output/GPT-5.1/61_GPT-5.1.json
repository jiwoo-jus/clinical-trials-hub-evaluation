      "briefSummary": "This randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial (CONTAIN) evaluated whether inhaled and intranasal ciclesonide improves respiratory symptoms in non-hospitalized adults with confirmed COVID-19. Adults aged 18 years or older with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and at least one of fever, cough, or shortness of breath were randomized to high-dose inhaled ciclesonide plus intranasal ciclesonide or matching saline placebos for 14 days. The primary outcome was complete resolution of fever and respiratory symptoms at day 7. Among 203 participants (median age 35 years, mostly without comorbidities), ciclesonide did not significantly increase the proportion with symptom resolution at day 7 or day 14 compared with placebo, and hospitalizations were infrequent in both groups. The study concluded that in this relatively young, healthy outpatient population with prominent respiratory symptoms, inhaled and intranasal ciclesonide did not provide a clear clinical benefit, and further placebo-controlled research in higher-risk populations is needed.",
      "detailedDescription": "The CONTAIN trial was a multicentre, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study conducted in three Canadian provinces (Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia) to assess whether early administration of inhaled and intranasal ciclesonide improves respiratory symptom resolution in adult outpatients with COVID-19.\n\nAdults aged 18 years or older with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and at least one mandatory symptom (fever, cough—wet or dry—or dyspnoea, including shortness of breath, chest congestion, or chest tightness) were eligible, provided they were not hospitalized and were not already receiving inhaled corticosteroids. Recruitment was done via testing site lists, telehealth clinics, and social media, and enrollment occurred online with electronic informed consent. The trial aimed to recruit participants early in the disease course, initially within five days of symptom onset and later allowing up to six days if same-day delivery of study drug was possible. Vaccinated individuals were excluded once COVID-19 vaccination became widespread, to maintain a relatively homogeneous, unvaccinated outpatient cohort.\n\nParticipants were randomized 1:1 using a centrally generated, sex-stratified permuted block schedule to receive either active ciclesonide or placebo. The intervention consisted of high-dose inhaled ciclesonide 600 μg twice daily (total 1200 μg/day) plus intranasal ciclesonide 200 μg once daily, administered for 14 days. The control group received a saline metered dose inhaler and intranasal saline matched in appearance and dosing schedule. Study medication was shipped to participants, usually overnight, with same-day delivery for those enrolled on day 6 of symptoms. Investigators, participants, and statisticians remained blinded to allocation throughout the trial.\n\nOutcome data were self-reported using structured electronic surveys completed on the day of enrolment, treatment day 0, and days 1, 3, 7, 10, and 14, with an additional day-29 follow-up for longer-term outcomes (reported elsewhere). The prespecified primary endpoint was complete resolution of self-reported fever and all respiratory symptoms (cough and dyspnoea or equivalents) at day 7 after initiation of therapy. Respiratory symptoms were defined as any cough (wet or dry) or dyspnoea (shortness of breath, chest tightness, or chest congestion). Key secondary outcomes included hospital admission or death due to COVID-19, resolution of the primary symptom set by day 14, global improvement in overall feeling by days 7 and 14, resolution of dyspnoea among those with baseline dyspnoea, improvement in cough severity on a 0–10 visual analogue scale, and changes in patient-reported outcomes for dyspnoea, sleep disturbance, and anxiety using PROMIS instruments. Adverse events, including thrush, throat irritation, voice change, wheeze, nausea, and headache, were monitored via questionnaires and direct participant contact.\n\nThe modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population included participants who received at least one dose of study drug and completed at least one follow-up survey. Of 215 randomized individuals, 203 were included in the mITT analysis: 105 in the ciclesonide group and 98 in the placebo group. The median age was 35 years (interquartile range 27–47) and 54% were women. Chronic health conditions were reported by about one-fifth of participants, and only 7% were current smokers. At baseline, 86% reported cough, 50% reported dyspnoea or equivalent symptoms, and 46% reported fever, reflecting a cohort with prominent respiratory involvement.\n\nBy day 7, fever and all respiratory symptoms had resolved in 37% of participants overall. The primary outcome occurred in 40% (42/105) of the ciclesonide group and 35% (34/98) of the placebo group. Using binomial regression adjusted for sex, the absolute risk difference was 5.5% (95% confidence interval −7.8% to 18.8%), which was not statistically significant. The per-protocol analysis, excluding non-adherent participants, yielded a similar adjusted risk difference of 3.4% (95% CI −10.4% to 17.1%). At day 14, 66% (69/105) of the ciclesonide group and 58% (57/98) of the placebo group achieved resolution of fever and respiratory symptoms, with an adjusted risk difference of 7.5% (95% CI −5.9% to 20.8%), again without clear evidence of benefit.\n\nHospitalization was infrequent: six participants in the ciclesonide arm and three in the placebo arm required hospital admission; no deaths occurred. PROMIS-based measures of dyspnoea, sleep disturbance, and anxiety did not show meaningful between-group differences. Overall adherence to study medication was high in both groups (approximately 93–94% took the drug on most survey days or until symptom resolution). Side effects were somewhat more common in the ciclesonide group (22% vs 15%), with headache and nausea being the most frequently reported; however, no major safety concerns emerged, and blinding appeared to be well maintained.\n\nThe original sample size calculation, based on a prior outpatient COVID-19 hydroxychloroquine trial, assumed that 65% of participants would have symptom resolution by day 7 and that ciclesonide would increase this proportion to 80%, requiring 318 participants to provide 80% power with a two-sided α of 0.05, accounting for up to 15% dropout. The CONTAIN trial was halted early, after recruitment slowed markedly due to rising vaccination rates and declining COVID-19 incidence, and after emerging data and practical constraints suggested that the planned sample size and effect size would not be achievable. An interim data safety monitoring board review did not identify safety issues but confirmed lower-than-expected day-7 symptom resolution rates (~37%), likely reflecting the enrichment of participants with respiratory symptoms.\n\nThe investigators concluded that, in this predominantly young, otherwise healthy outpatient cohort with early, symptomatic COVID-19 and prominent respiratory complaints, high-dose inhaled plus intranasal ciclesonide did not confer a statistically significant advantage over placebo in achieving complete symptom resolution by day 7 or day 14. The trial may have been underpowered to detect small effect sizes, and the findings may not generalize to older or higher-risk populations. Given in vitro evidence of antiviral activity for ciclesonide and suggestive but methodologically limited findings from open-label inhaled corticosteroid trials (e.g., with budesonide), the authors recommend further adequately powered, placebo-controlled trials, particularly focusing on higher-risk patients and longer follow-up periods, to clarify whether inhaled corticosteroids meaningfully impact symptom burden or clinical deterioration in COVID-19."
