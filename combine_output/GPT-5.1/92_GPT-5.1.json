      "briefSummary": "This phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, first‑in‑human trial evaluated bepirovirsen, an antisense oligonucleotide that targets hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA, in adults with chronic hepatitis B infection. The study enrolled both treatment‑naïve patients and patients already on stable nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) therapy. Participants received subcutaneous bepirovirsen (150 mg or 300 mg) or placebo twice weekly for 2 weeks then once weekly for 2 weeks, followed by 26 weeks of follow‑up. The main goal was to assess safety and tolerability; a key secondary goal was to measure antiviral activity, particularly change in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) levels. Bepirovirsen produced dose‑dependent reductions in HBsAg and HBV DNA, with significant effects at 300 mg, and a generally favorable safety profile, though transient alanine aminotransferase (ALT) flares were observed and appeared related to antiviral activity.",
      "detailedDescription": "This first‑in‑human, phase 2, double‑blind, randomized, placebo‑controlled, dose‑escalation trial (NCT02981602; ISIS 505358‑CS3; GSK study 205695) investigated the safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of bepirovirsen (GSK3228836) in adults with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Bepirovirsen is a 2′‑O‑methoxyethyl (2′‑MOE) gapmer antisense oligonucleotide with phosphorothioate linkages that binds a conserved sequence present in all HBV mRNAs and pregenomic RNA, leading to RNase H–mediated cleavage, and reductions in HBV RNA, HBV DNA, and viral proteins, including hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).\n\nEligible participants had chronic HBV infection for at least 6 months and serum HBsAg ≥50 IU/mL; both hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)–positive and HBeAg‑negative patients were included. Treatment‑naïve participants required HBV DNA ≥2×10³ IU/mL; on‑NA participants had HBV DNA below the lower limit of quantitation while on stable tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or entecavir for ≥12 months.\n\nA total of 31 patients with CHB were enrolled at centers in Hong Kong and the Republic of Korea: 24 treatment‑naïve (randomized to placebo, bepirovirsen 150 mg, or bepirovirsen 300 mg) and 7 on stable NA therapy (randomized to placebo or bepirovirsen 300 mg). Study drug was administered subcutaneously six times over 4 weeks: twice weekly during weeks 1 and 2 (days 1, 4, 8, 11) and once weekly during weeks 3 and 4 (days 15 and 22). Treatment‑naïve patients then initiated NA therapy on day 29; on‑NA patients continued their background NA. All participants were followed through day 211 (week 31).\n\nThe primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability, including adverse events (AEs), laboratory parameters (notably liver enzymes, C‑reactive protein, coagulation tests), vital signs, ECGs, and physical examinations. Secondary objectives included evaluation of antiviral activity: changes from baseline to day 29 and week 31 in serum HBsAg, plasma HBV DNA, and serum HBeAg (in HBeAg‑positive patients), as well as the proportion of patients achieving HBsAg or HBeAg loss. Exploratory endpoints included HBV RNA, hepatitis B core‑related antigen (HBcrAg), and seroconversion to anti‑HBs or anti‑HBe antibodies.\n\nBepirovirsen was generally well tolerated. The most common treatment‑emergent adverse events were mild to moderate injection‑site reactions (erythema, swelling, pruritus, bruising, pain) and pyrexia. Transient elevations in C‑reactive protein were observed after initial dosing, consistent with known class effects of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, without consistent associated symptoms. Transient, modest prolongations of activated partial thromboplastin time occurred but were not clinically significant and were not associated with bleeding. No complement activation–related findings were observed.\n\nALT flares (ALT ≥2× upper limit of normal) occurred in 8 of 18 bepirovirsen‑treated treatment‑naïve patients and 3 of 5 bepirovirsen‑treated on‑NA patients but in no placebo recipients. These flares were transient and self‑resolving, sometimes reaching ≥10× ULN, and occurred in the absence of bilirubin elevations suggesting liver failure. ALT elevations tended to coincide with, or follow, substantial reductions in HBsAg and HBV DNA, and were rare in patients without HBsAg decline or in healthy volunteer studies, supporting the interpretation that ALT flares reflect pharmacologic, possibly immune‑mediated, clearance of infected hepatocytes rather than direct drug toxicity. One patient had a grade 4 ALT increase (ALT 781 U/L) accompanied by AST elevation but remained asymptomatic and recovered without lasting sequelae.\n\nAntiviral activity was dose‑dependent. Among treatment‑naïve patients, mean reductions from baseline to day 29 with bepirovirsen 150 mg were −0.50 log10 IU/mL for HBsAg and −0.38 log10 IU/mL for HBV DNA, which were not statistically significant versus placebo. With bepirovirsen 300 mg, mean reductions were −1.56 log10 IU/mL for HBsAg (P=0.001 vs placebo) and −1.66 log10 IU/mL for HBV DNA (P<0.001 vs placebo). No meaningful HBsAg or HBV DNA reductions occurred in placebo recipients. Six of 12 treatment‑naïve patients on 300 mg had ≥1.0 log10 HBsAg reduction by day 29 (three had ≥3.0 log10 reduction), and two achieved transient or more prolonged HBsAg loss (HBsAg below 0.05 IU/mL), with variable durability after treatment cessation.\n\nIn on‑NA patients receiving bepirovirsen 300 mg, mean HBsAg reduction was −1.99 log10 IU/mL by day 29. Three of four evaluable on‑NA patients experienced ≥3.0 log10 HBsAg declines; two achieved HBsAg loss, one with more sustained suppression through week 31 while maintaining a marked reduction versus baseline. Baseline HBV RNA and HBcrAg levels in on‑NA patients were low or near assay limits, consistent with effective NA therapy, limiting detailed interpretation.\n\nHBsAg and HBV DNA reductions occurred in both HBeAg‑positive and HBeAg‑negative patients, but log10 declines were generally greater in HBeAg‑negative patients, who also had lower baseline antigen and viral loads. All four patients who achieved HBsAg loss were HBeAg‑negative. Post hoc analyses showed that patients with larger HBsAg reductions often had parallel decreases in HBV RNA and HBcrAg, supporting on‑target inhibition of HBV transcription. Minimal changes in HBeAg were seen overall, with more substantial reductions observed in a minority of patients.\n\nTransient, treatment‑emergent anti‑HBs antibodies were detected in a subset of bepirovirsen‑treated patients, especially those with larger HBsAg reductions, consistent with unmasking of pre‑existing or newly generated antibodies once circulating HBsAg levels declined. Anti‑HBe seroconversion was rare but observed in isolated cases with sustained HBeAg decline.\n\nSequencing of HBV DNA or RNA from selected patients at baseline, day 29, and day 113 showed no changes in the bepirovirsen binding site, suggesting that virologic responses or non‑responses were not driven by loss of the target sequence.\n\nOverall, 4 weeks of bepirovirsen treatment at 300 mg induced rapid, sometimes profound, and variably sustained reductions in HBsAg and HBV DNA in both treatment‑naïve and virally suppressed CHB patients, with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile and ALT flares that appeared linked to antiviral activity. These findings support further clinical development of bepirovirsen, including studies of longer treatment durations and combination regimens aimed at achieving functional cure (sustained HBsAg loss with undetectable HBV DNA) in a broader chronic hepatitis B population."
