      "briefSummary": "This three-arm randomized controlled trial is testing whether a habit-formation intervention based on the cue–reward–repetition model can improve adherence to daily urate-lowering therapy in adults with gout. Participants receive electronic pill bottles and are randomized to: (1) a non-adaptive intervention linking medication-taking to a self-chosen daily cue plus a fixed charitable donation reward and conditional reminder texts; (2) an adaptive intervention that starts with a lower charitable reward and no texts, with escalation to higher rewards and cue-reminder texts if adherence is suboptimal at 6 weeks; or (3) a control arm with electronic monitoring only. The primary outcome is medication adherence over 18 weeks; secondary outcomes include habit automaticity, integration of medication-taking into routines, intentions and perceptions about medications, and exploratory changes in serum uric acid.",
      "detailedDescription": "This pragmatic, prospective, three-arm parallel randomized controlled trial evaluates a habit formation intervention to improve adherence to daily urate-lowering therapy (ULT) among adults with gout who have suboptimal serum uric acid control. Non-adherence to chronic medications is common and contributes to preventable morbidity, and poor adherence to ULT is a key reason many gout patients fail to achieve target uric acid levels and continue to experience debilitating flares. The intervention is grounded in habit formation theory, specifically the cue–reward–repetition model, which proposes that repeatedly performing a behavior in response to a consistent cue and receiving a reward leads to automaticity, such that the behavior becomes a habit driven by contextual cues rather than conscious intention.\n\nEligible participants are adults (≥18 years) with gout receiving a stable oral ULT regimen and with a recent serum uric acid level >6 mg/dL. They are recruited from rheumatology and primary care practices affiliated with Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and must have a smartphone with data or WiFi and be able to use electronic pill bottles; pregnant individuals and those unable to participate in English are excluded. After remote screening, electronic informed consent, and baseline questionnaires, participants are randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio, using block randomization stratified by recruitment source (rheumatology vs primary care) and baseline uric acid (>6.0–8.0 mg/dL vs >8.0 mg/dL), to one of two intervention arms or a control arm.\n\nAll participants receive electronic pill bottles (Pillsy) that record date and time of each opening via Bluetooth to a smartphone app and cloud portal, with device alerts disabled to minimize additional adherence prompts. Adherence is operationalized as the proportion of recorded bottle openings to prescribed doses, capped at one opening per 3-hour window to avoid counting multiple openings as extra doses. For patients on multiple study medications, adherence is averaged across medications.\n\nIn Arm 1 (non-adaptive intervention), participants select a daily lifestyle cue (e.g., brushing teeth) to which they will link medication-taking during a structured goal-setting exercise. They also choose a charity (local animal shelter, local food bank, or UNICEF). A sticker with the charity logo is placed under the pill bottle cap to reinforce the association between medication-taking and the charitable reward. For every adherent day over a 12-week intervention period, US$0.50 is donated to their chosen charity. Every 4 days, participants receive text messages summarizing donations and describing their potential impact. If 4-day adherence falls below 75%, participants receive additional reminder texts about their chosen cue. After 12 weeks, the intervention stops and participants are observed for a further 6 weeks without any cues or rewards.\n\nIn Arm 2 (adaptive intervention), participants initially receive the same cue-based structure and charitable donations but with a lower reward of US$0.25 per adherent day and no reminder texts for the first 6 weeks. At 6 weeks, adherence is assessed; participants whose adherence is <75% are “intensified”: they begin to receive cue-reminder text messages similar to Arm 1 and their charitable reward increases to US$0.50 per adherent day for the remaining 6 weeks. Participants in this arm are then followed for an additional 6 weeks without any intervention, for a total of 18 weeks.\n\nArm 3 (control) participants receive the electronic pill bottles for adherence monitoring only and no cue or reward intervention during the 18-week follow-up.\n\nBaseline data collection includes demographics, medical history, disease activity, and self-reported adherence, as well as measures of habit-related constructs. These include the Self-Report Behaviour Automaticity Index to assess the extent to which medication-taking is automatic; a routine assessment questionnaire evaluating how well medication-taking is integrated into daily routines; and a modified HIV Intention and Knowledge scale assessing intentions and perceptions about medications. Coexisting conditions and uric acid values are obtained from the electronic health record. At the end of follow-up, participants complete a questionnaire mirroring baseline measures, along with questions on the acceptability, feasibility, and perceived usefulness of the intervention. Participants receive a US$50 gift card after completing the end-of-study survey.\n\nThe primary outcome is mean adherence to ULT over 18 weeks post-randomization, calculated as the average proportion of prescribed doses taken (based on pill bottle openings) across study medications. Secondary outcomes include changes from baseline in medication-taking automaticity, sense of routine, and intentions/perceptions about medications, as well as feasibility and acceptability metrics within the intervention arms. Exploratory analyses will examine changes in serum uric acid from baseline using EHR values closest to the end of follow-up, recognizing that uric acid assessments may be incomplete (anticipated 15–20% missing) and potentially differential by adherence.\n\nAnalyses will follow intention-to-treat principles, including all randomized participants. Baseline characteristics will be summarized by arm, and intervention arms will be compared to control using appropriate parametric or non-parametric tests. Primary and exploratory continuous outcomes (mean adherence and serum uric acid) will be evaluated using generalized estimating equations with identity link and normal errors; adjusted analyses will be performed if baseline imbalances are present. Sensitivity analyses using multiple imputation and alternative lab time points will be considered if missing outcome data are substantial. The sample size of 20 participants per arm (60 total) is powered (80% at alpha 0.05) to detect a 20% relative increase in adherence from a baseline adherence rate of 50% in each intervention arm compared with control.\n\nThe study has Institutional Review Board approval at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Due to the behavioral and low-risk nature of the trial, no data monitoring committee was required. Data analysts will be blinded to treatment assignments, but participants cannot be blinded to the cue–reward intervention. Trial results will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed, publicly accessible journal. If effective, this individualized, habit-based cue–reward approach to medication adherence could be adapted and scaled to other chronic conditions, healthcare settings, and health behaviors."
