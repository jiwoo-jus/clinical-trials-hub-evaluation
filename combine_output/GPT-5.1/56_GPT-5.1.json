      "briefSummary": "The CHOICES study is a randomized clinical trial conducted in five HIV clinics that compares extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), an opioid antagonist injection that requires complete opioid abstinence before the first dose, with treatment-as-usual (methadone or buprenorphine) for people living with HIV and moderate or severe opioid use disorder (OUD). This qualitative sub-study interviewed 37 participants with HIV and OUD who had been randomized to XR-NTX, including individuals who did and did not successfully complete XR-NTX induction, to understand their experiences with opioid withdrawal and starting XR-NTX. The goal was to identify barriers and facilitators to successful XR-NTX initiation, such as readiness to change, withdrawal setting, support from staff and family, fear of withdrawal, ambivalence about stopping opioids, concerns about XR-NTX effects, and preferences for other medications.",
      "detailedDescription": "This qualitative investigation is nested within the \"Comparing Treatments for HIV-Infected Opioid Users in an Integrated Care Effectiveness Study (CHOICES) Scale-up study\" (CTN-0067), a multi-site randomized trial in five HIV clinics that allocate participants with HIV and moderate or severe opioid use disorder (OUD) to either opioid agonist therapy (methadone or buprenorphine) or opioid antagonist therapy with extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX). XR-NTX is a monthly intramuscular injection that blocks opioid effects but requires that patients be opioid-free for several days prior to induction to avoid precipitated withdrawal.\n\nBecause earlier work showed that many participants randomized to XR-NTX failed to complete induction, this sub-study sought to characterize, in depth, the experiences of individuals assigned to XR-NTX with respect to opioid withdrawal and induction. A convenience sample of 37 of the 55 participants randomized to XR-NTX was interviewed between 2018 and 2019, including 20 who successfully completed XR-NTX induction and 17 who did not. Participants were adults with HIV and moderate or severe OUD and unsuppressed HIV viral load (≥200 copies/mL) at enrollment. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted in person or by telephone, digitally recorded, professionally transcribed, and analyzed using constructivist thematic analysis following Braun and Clarke’s six-step approach. Three experienced qualitative researchers developed and refined the coding scheme, achieved inter-coder reliability (85% on 10% of transcripts), and identified key themes related to withdrawal and XR-NTX induction.\n\nAmong participants who successfully completed XR-NTX induction, themes included (1) a strong readiness or motivation for change (e.g., desire for a better life, concern for family, prior overdose experiences), (2) undergoing withdrawal in a supportive environment, particularly inpatient medically managed withdrawal settings with access to comfort medications and a controlled environment away from drug use triggers, and (3) caring and flexible interactions with clinic and study staff who provided education, emotional support, assistance with logistics such as child care, and medications to alleviate withdrawal symptoms.\n\nIn contrast, among those who did not complete XR-NTX induction, four contrasting themes emerged: (1) concern and anxiety about opioid withdrawal, often rooted in past negative withdrawal experiences and exacerbated by homelessness or lack of structured settings, with particular difficulty when fentanyl exposure was present; (2) ambivalence about or reluctance to stop opioids, including recognition of perceived benefits of opioids such as pain relief or coping with psychosocial stressors; (3) concerns and misperceptions about XR-NTX itself, including fear of precipitated withdrawal, unmanaged pain, persistent cravings, compensatory use of other substances (e.g., stimulants), or overdose if opioids were used while on XR-NTX; and (4) preference for alternative medications such as methadone or buprenorphine, especially when participants had prior positive experiences or were started on these medications during medically supervised withdrawal and chose to remain on them.\n\nThe study highlights that successful XR-NTX induction among people with HIV and OUD is facilitated by patient readiness to change, access to safe and supportive withdrawal management (ideally inpatient with ancillary medications), and strong therapeutic relationships with staff. Barriers include fear of withdrawal, particularly in the context of fentanyl use, insufficient structural support (e.g., homelessness, lack of access to detox facilities), ongoing ambivalence about abstinence from opioids, negative or conflicting information about XR-NTX, and strong preferences for agonist therapies. The findings support the importance of shared decision-making, motivational interventions, better management of opioid and fentanyl withdrawal (including comfort medications and appropriate settings), and clear patient education about XR-NTX versus agonist medications. They also underscore the need for targeted strategies to improve XR-NTX initiation in high-need populations such as individuals living with uncontrolled HIV and OUD."
