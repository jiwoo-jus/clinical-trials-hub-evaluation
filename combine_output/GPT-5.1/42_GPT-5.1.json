      "briefSummary": "This open-label, single-arm phase IV study evaluated the safety, local tolerability, systemic exposure, and analgesic effectiveness of the FLECTOR diclofenac epolamine topical system (FDETS) in children aged 6–16 years with recent minor soft tissue injuries and at least moderate pain. Children applied the diclofenac patch twice daily for up to 14 days or until pain resolved. The main focus was to determine whether the patch is safe and well tolerated in a pediatric population, with minimal systemic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug exposure, while providing effective pain relief similar to that seen in adults.",
      "detailedDescription": "This post-marketing, open-label, single-arm phase IV clinical trial was conducted at ten family medicine or pediatric practices in the USA from May 2014 to October 2016. The study was required by the US Food and Drug Administration to characterize the safety and efficacy of the FLECTOR diclofenac epolamine topical system (FDETS, 1.3% diclofenac epolamine; 180 mg per 10 × 14 cm system) in a pediatric population.\n\nEligible participants were children aged 6–16 years who had sustained a clinically significant minor soft tissue injury (e.g., minor strains, sprains, contusions, sports-related trauma not requiring surgery or immobilization) within the previous 96 hours and reported at least moderate spontaneous pain, defined as a score of ≥3 on the 0–5 Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale. Exclusion criteria included major or midline injuries, involvement of spine, digits, or hands, open skin lesions in the treatment area, severe cardiac, renal, or hepatic impairment, recent use of long-acting NSAIDs or topical medications at the injury site, and concomitant medications that could interact with diclofenac or pose safety risks. Post-menarcheal girls required a negative pregnancy test.\n\nAll enrolled patients received FDETS applied directly to the injury site twice daily (morning and evening) until pain resolution or up to Day 14. The first patch was applied in clinic under supervision, and subsequent applications were performed at home by patients or their caregivers. If the patch overlapped on itself at the application site, it could be trimmed; if a patch detached due to water exposure, a replacement patch could be applied, allowing up to three patches in a single day. Patients were instructed to avoid other topical medications on the injured area and systemic analgesics including other NSAIDs, opioids, and systemic corticosteroids; non-pharmacologic measures such as rest-ice-compression-elevation were allowed.\n\nThe primary endpoint was local tolerability and systemic safety. Local tolerability at the application site was assessed at each clinic visit using a 7-point scale (0 = no skin changes to 6 = severe erythema with extension beyond the contact area), capturing redness and other skin reactions. Adverse events were monitored throughout the study and coded using MedDRA. Vital signs were recorded at clinic visits; specific cardiovascular or renal event monitoring was not implemented, given known low systemic exposure from this topical formulation.\n\nKey secondary endpoints were systemic diclofenac exposure and analgesic efficacy. Systemic exposure was evaluated via plasma diclofenac concentrations measured by a validated HPLC–MS/MS assay (quantitation range 0.05–50 ng/mL). Two 5 mL blood samples were planned per patient: one approximately 24 hours after the first patch application (Day 2 visit) and another at the final study visit (on pain resolution or Day 14). Sampling occurred while a patch was in place; timing was not fixed relative to dosing, so 2–3 patches might have been applied by the first sample. Data were analyzed overall and by age subgroup (6–11 years and 12–16 years) and compared with historical adult pharmacokinetic data from a separate study (CRO-PK-01-72) in which adults received FDETS twice daily for 4 days or a single 50 mg oral diclofenac tablet.\n\nAnalgesic efficacy was evaluated using patient-reported Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale scores (0–5). Baseline pain was recorded in clinic prior to the first application, and patients then recorded morning and evening pain scores in diaries throughout treatment. Pain scores over time were analyzed as a proportion of baseline (1.0 = no change, 0.0 = no pain). Pain trajectories in the pediatric age groups were compared using generalized estimating equations and contrasted with pain data from an adult study (00GB/Fp05) using FDETS. Investigators also provided a global response to therapy at the final visit on a 1–5 scale, from no clinical improvement to complete restoration of normal function without pain.\n\nThe study enrolled 104 patients, evenly split between ages 6–11 and 12–16 years (mean age 11.6 years). The most common injury sites were ankle, knee, foot, and wrist. Patients used the patch for a mean of 9.5 days, with an average of 2.1 patches per day.\n\nLocal tolerability was excellent: at screening, 93% of patients had no skin changes; over the course of treatment the highest observed score was 1 (faint redness), and by the last observation among patients still using FDETS all had a score of 0. No higher-grade application-site reactions were recorded.\n\nA total of 54 adverse events were reported in 32 patients (30.8%), with similar frequencies across age groups. There were no serious adverse events. The most common events were headache and pruritus, followed by mild gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, stomach discomfort, upper abdominal pain) and a few other symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, and epistaxis. Fourteen events in nine patients (8.7%) were considered at least possibly related to FDETS; pruritus was the most frequent treatment-related event. All adverse events were mild or moderate, and vital signs remained within normal ranges.\n\nPain decreased progressively in both age groups, with a somewhat faster and greater reduction in children aged 6–11 years compared with those aged 12–16 years. The pain trajectory in the older pediatric group resembled that observed in adults from the historical study. By the end of the study, 87% of patients had a pain score of 0 at clinic visits, and most remaining patients had minimal residual pain (score 1). Investigators rated 83.7% of patients as restored to normal function in the absence of pain.\n\nSystemic diclofenac exposure was low. Mean plasma concentrations for all pediatric patients were approximately 1.65 ng/mL at the first assessment and 1.80 ng/mL at the last assessment. Younger children had higher mean concentrations than adolescents (about 1.83 vs 1.46 ng/mL at the first assessment and 2.49 vs 1.11 ng/mL at the last), but levels remained low and were substantially lower than those seen after oral diclofenac dosing. When adjusted for sampling time (<13 h post-application) and trimming, geometric mean steady-state diclofenac concentrations were similar between the overall pediatric cohort (1.07 ng/mL) and historical adults treated with FDETS (1.18 ng/mL), with a 90% confidence interval indicating equivalence in systemic exposure. In contrast, mean maximum concentrations after a single 50 mg oral diclofenac tablet in adults were more than 500-fold higher than those achieved with FDETS in either children or adults.\n\nAnalyses did not demonstrate a significant correlation between the low, variable plasma diclofenac concentrations and the magnitude of pain relief, supporting the interpretation that local tissue concentrations under the patch, rather than systemic drug levels, are primarily responsible for the analgesic effect.\n\nOverall, the study showed that in children aged 6–16 years with minor soft tissue injuries, twice-daily application of FDETS for up to 14 days was associated with excellent local tolerability, low rates of generally mild adverse events, minimal systemic diclofenac exposure, and clinically meaningful pain relief. The safety, pharmacokinetic, and efficacy profiles in this pediatric cohort were consistent with previously reported adult data, supporting the use of FDETS for acute pain due to minor soft tissue injuries in pediatric patients."
