      "briefSummary": "This study evaluates an adaptive, trauma-informed, culturally tailored, technology-delivered safety planning and support intervention (weWomen Plus) for foreign-born immigrant women in the U.S. who have experienced intimate partner violence (IPV) in the past year. Using a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design, participants are first randomized to a culturally adapted online/web-based safety decision and planning tool (myPlan) or usual care safety resources. Outcomes for safety (IPV severity and frequency), empowerment, depression, and PTSD are measured at 3, 6, and 12 months. Women who show little or no improvement in safety and empowerment at 3 months are re-randomized to receive either supportive text messaging alone or a combination of text messaging and phone-based sessions with trained advocates. The study aims to determine which intervention type and intensity works best for which women and whether adding text and phone support improves outcomes for early non-responders.",
      "detailedDescription": "The trial tests weWomen Plus, an adaptive, multi-component, technology-based intervention designed for foreign-born immigrant women in the U.S. who have experienced intimate partner violence (IPV) in the past 12 months. The intervention is trauma-informed and culturally tailored to address the unique risks, barriers, and safety planning needs of immigrant women, including those related to immigration status, language, cultural norms, lack of familiarity with U.S. systems, and limited social support.\n\nDesign and randomization:\nThe study uses a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design to optimize intervention type and intensity based on participant response. In the first randomization stage, eligible women (aged 18–64, immigrant, IPV within past year, with safe access to internet-enabled devices and phone/text) are randomized to either:\n1) An online/web-based intervention website delivering a culturally adapted version of the myPlan safety decision and planning app; or\n2) A control website with usual safety planning information modeled on national and state domestic violence resources (no Danger Assessment-based tailoring).\n\nData are collected via web or smartphone-based questionnaires at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. Primary outcomes include severity and frequency of IPV and measures of empowerment; secondary outcomes include depression and PTSD symptoms.\n\nIntervention components:\nThe core online component is a culturally adapted myPlan app. myPlan is grounded in Dutton’s empowerment model and includes: (a) education on relationship \"red flags\"; (b) a validated Danger Assessment (DA) adapted for immigrant women to estimate risk for severe or lethal IPV, with immediate feedback on danger level; and (c) a priority-setting activity to help women clarify what matters most (e.g., children’s safety, resources, health). Inputs are combined via an evidence-based algorithm to produce a tailored safety plan with links to local (when available) and national resources. An onboarding process provides guidance on safe technology use and requires creation of a PIN-protected login.\n\nWomen initially allocated to usual care receive standard, non-tailored online safety planning resources, including risk assessment items based on formative research identifying additional immigrant-specific risk factors, but they do not receive DA-informed tailored planning.\n\nSecond-stage randomization for non-responders:\nAt 3 months, women in both initial arms are classified as responders or non-responders based on changes from baseline in IPV severity/frequency and empowerment. Non-response is defined as less than a 0.25 standard deviation improvement in both decreased IPV and increased empowerment. Women who are non-responders are re-randomized to one of two additional, technology-delivered supports:\n1) A structured text messaging intervention; or\n2) A combination of the same text messaging plus two phone sessions with a trained facilitator.\n\nResponders continue with their original allocation and complete further follow-up assessments only.\n\nText messaging intervention:\nThe text component is based on an empowerment and strengths-based framework, informed by a psychosocial readiness model. Over 4 weeks, women receive tailored weekly text sessions at pre-selected safe times. Sessions assess current feelings of safety, readiness to take safety actions, past use and barriers to safety strategies, and self-perceived danger. Messages provide information on safety planning elements, local and national resources, formal and informal supports, and self-care strategies for mental and physical health. If a woman rates her future risk of severe violence higher than a specified threshold, she receives a short form of the Danger Assessment to further evaluate risk. Content is tailored according to readiness to change, usefulness of prior resources, living situation and relationship status. All text sessions end with emergency resource information and safety reminders (e.g., deleting messages).\n\nPhone call intervention:\nThe phone component augments the text messages and is delivered by trained facilitators using a trauma-informed, strengths-based, motivational enhancement and solution-focused approach. Two calls are conducted: the first one week after completion of the text series, and the second one week later. In the first call, facilitators build rapport, validate experiences, highlight strengths and protective factors, reframe deficits, explore primary concerns, use scaling questions to enhance motivation, encourage \"change talk,\" and collaboratively establish realistic, participant-driven goals related to safety and well-being. Safety assessment is conducted during each call. The second call reviews progress toward goals, identifies barriers, explores exceptions (times when problems are less severe), and reinforces both general and culturally specific strengths and resources, while refining safety and empowerment strategies.\n\nOutcomes and measures:\nPrimary outcomes:\n- Severity and frequency of IPV: measured with an adapted Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2), including subscales for physical aggression, injury, psychological aggression, and sexual coercion. Frequency in the past 12 months is recorded with standard CTS2 categories, and items are aggregated using severity-times-frequency weighted scores.\n- Empowerment (overall): assessed with the Personal Progress Scale-Revised (PPS-R), a 28-item self-report measure capturing self-evaluation, self-esteem, emotional regulation, cultural and gender identity awareness, self-efficacy, self-care, problem-solving, assertiveness, and access to resources. Items are rated from 1 (Almost Never) to 7 (Almost Always), summed to yield higher scores for greater empowerment.\n- Empowerment related to safety: measured with the 13-item Measure of Victim Empowerment Related to Safety (MOVERS), which assesses safety-related goal-setting, perceived ability to accomplish safety goals, perceived costs or difficulties triggered by safety efforts, and knowledge of and access to supports. Items are rated from 1 (never true) to 5 (always true), with higher total scores indicating greater safety-related empowerment.\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n- Depression: assessed using the PHQ-9, a 9-item measure of depressive symptoms over the past 2 weeks, scored 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day); total scores reflect depression severity.\n- Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): assessed with the 16-item Harvard Trauma Questionnaire PTSD subscale, measuring symptoms over the past week in intrusion, avoidance/numbing, and hyperarousal domains, with items scored from 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Extremely); higher scores indicate more severe PTSD symptoms.\n\nAnalysis plan:\nPrimary analyses follow intention-to-treat principles. T-tests and chi-square tests will assess baseline balance across randomized groups. Missing data will be addressed using multiple imputation via Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods, with predictors of missingness included in models. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) with robust variance estimation will evaluate group-by-time interactions for primary and secondary outcomes, comparing the online/web-based myPlan adaptation versus usual care across 3, 6, and 12 months.\n\nLogistic regression will identify baseline predictors of non-response (for safety and empowerment) among those assigned to the online intervention in the first stage, including demographics, acculturation, attitudes toward violence against women, and social support. These predictors will also be used as covariates in subsequent models.\n\nTo test the effect of adaptive augmentation for non-responders, GEE models will compare three groups: (1) initial responders from both original arms, (2) non-responders re-randomized to text messaging alone, and (3) non-responders re-randomized to text plus phone. Analyses will assess whether non-responders who receive additional support can reach outcomes comparable to initial responders. A weighted and replicated estimation method will be used to simultaneously estimate effects of embedded adaptive interventions, with inverse probability weights based on the number of randomizations.\n\nSample size and power:\nInvestigators estimate that 30% of women in the online intervention arm will be non-responders at 3 months. With 80% retention at 12 months and an effect size of 0.25, a sample of 253 participants per first-stage group (total N=1266; 633 per arm) provides 80% power (alpha=0.05) to detect differences in change over time between the online myPlan intervention and usual care. Under these assumptions, approximately 190 non-responders from the intervention arm will be re-randomized (95 per text-only vs. text+phone), and 316 non-responders in the control arm (158 per text-only vs. text+phone), allowing detection of small-to-moderate effects, particularly for the phone-augmented condition.\n\nSafety, ethics, and data monitoring:\nThe study is approved by the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine IRB. Participants provide verbal and electronic written consent. Safety protocols include guidance on private and secure use of devices, safe timing and modes of contact, and confidentiality procedures (use of non-identifying study IDs, separate storage of contact and survey data, SSL encryption, and strict access control). Women may stop participation at any time. The team performs periodic safety check-ins, provides information about emergency and IPV support resources, and follows a structured suicide risk protocol. Mandated reporting procedures apply for identified child abuse or imminent risk of suicide or homicide.\n\nA Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) comprising independent experts in ethics, intervention research, biostatistics, and immigrant/IPV work oversees participant safety and protocol adherence. The DSMB reviews interim analyses approximately every 6 months and may recommend continuing, modifying, or stopping the trial based on safety or other concerns.\n\nImplications:\nThis trial aims to generate rigorous evidence on a culturally tailored, adaptive, technology-based intervention for immigrant women exposed to IPV, addressing a major gap in IPV and immigrant health research. By leveraging web, text, and phone modalities in a SMART design, the study seeks to identify which combinations and intensities of support best improve safety, mental health, and empowerment for diverse immigrant women, and to inform scalable interventions for healthcare, social service, and IPV-focused settings."
