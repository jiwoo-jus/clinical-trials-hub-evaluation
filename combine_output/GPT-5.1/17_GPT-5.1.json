      "briefSummary": "This multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Tenoten, an anxiolytic drug containing highly diluted antibodies to S100 protein, in adults with anxiety associated with somatoform dysfunction, reactions to severe stress, adjustment disorders, and other neurotic disorders. A total of 390 outpatients aged 18–45 years with clinically diagnosed neurotic disorders and clinically significant anxiety (HADS-A ≥ 11) were randomized to receive Tenoten at two dosing regimens (4 or 8 tablets per day) or matching placebo for 12 weeks. The main hypothesis was that Tenoten would reduce anxiety severity, measured by change in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) scores, more than placebo while being well tolerated.",
      "detailedDescription": "This multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted at 23 sites in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan from February 2017 to September 2018 to investigate the safety and efficacy of Tenoten in treating anxiety in adults with somatoform dysfunction (SfD), reactions to severe stress (RSS), adjustment disorders (AjD), and other neurotic disorders (oNDs).\n\nTenoten is an anxiolytic drug containing highly diluted antibodies to the S100 protein, manufactured under GMP conditions and registered as a conventional drug in the European Economic Community. Preclinical and prior clinical data suggested stress-protective, anxiolytic, antidepressant, antiamnestic, and neuroprotective properties, with a safety profile comparable or superior to standard anxiolytics.\n\nEligible participants were outpatients aged 18–45 years with ICD-10 diagnoses of SfD (F45.0, F45.1, F45.2, F45.4, F45.8, F45.9), RSS and AjD (F43.0, F43.1, F43.2, F43.8, F43.9), or other neurotic disorders (F48.8, F48.9), and with anxiety scores ≥ 11 on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale—Anxiety subscale (HADS-A). Patients with significant depressive symptoms (HADS-D ≥ 11), other mental disorders, serious somatic or neurological diseases, substance use disorders, pregnancy, or breastfeeding were excluded. Psycholeptics, psychoanaleptics, antiepileptics, anticholinergics, dopaminergic agents, antioxidants, hormones, and psychotherapy were not allowed for 4 months before and during the trial.\n\nParticipants were randomized in a 1:1:0.5:0.5 ratio into four groups using an interactive randomization system: Tenoten group 1 (2 tablets twice daily; 4 tablets/day), Tenoten group 3 (2 tablets four times daily; 8 tablets/day), and two placebo groups (2 and 4), which were later combined for analysis. Tenoten and placebo tablets were identical in appearance and organoleptic properties. The treatment period lasted 12 weeks, with visits every 4 weeks. At baseline and follow-up visits, investigators assessed anxiety with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and documented medications and safety events. Patients also completed HADS and EQ-5D-3L; the Clinical Global Impression–Efficacy Index (CGI-EI) and EQ-5D-3L were evaluated at the final visit.\n\nThe primary endpoint was the change from baseline in mean HAM-A total score after 12 weeks of treatment in the Tenoten 4-tablet and 8-tablet groups compared with placebo. Exploratory endpoints included HAM-A changes after 4 and 8 weeks, the proportion of treatment responders (≥ 50% reduction in HAM-A score), the percentage of patients achieving remission of anxiety (HAM-A < 14) at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, changes in quality of life by EQ-5D-3L, and CGI-EI scores. Post hoc analyses explored the influence of specific diagnostic categories (F43, F45, F48) on overall HAM-A dynamics, item subscores (especially somatic items 7–13), and on placebo effects.\n\nSample size planning targeted control of type I error (0.05 overall, with α = 0.0166 per primary hypothesis) and type II error (0.2). Assumptions included a >4-point expected difference in HAM-A reduction between each Tenoten group and placebo and <3-point difference between Tenoten dose regimens, with variance of HAM-A change estimated as 44 and anticipated dropout <20%. ANCOVA was used to analyze changes from baseline, with normality assessed and Yeo–Johnson transformation applied if needed; nonparametric tests and Fisher’s exact test were used for categorical and non-normal data, and mixed or multinomial ANOVA for post hoc analyses.\n\nOf the 390 enrolled patients (safety population), 384 with HADS-A ≥ 11 formed the intention-to-treat (ITT) set, and 344 the per-protocol (PP) set. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, including diagnostic category distributions and HAM-A and EQ-5D-3L scores, were comparable across groups.\n\nAfter 12 weeks, mean HAM-A scores decreased from 18.81 ± 5.81 to 7.26 ± 4.63 in the Tenoten 4-tablet group and from 18.38 ± 4.3 to 6.40 ± 4.02 in the Tenoten 8-tablet group, compared with 8.48 ± 5.13 in the placebo group. Mean reductions were 11.25, 11.91, and 9.71 points for Tenoten 4-tablet, Tenoten 8-tablet, and placebo groups, respectively, with statistically significant differences favoring Tenoten over placebo (p = 0.0055 for 4 tablets/day; p < 0.0001 for 8 tablets/day). Remission of anxiety (HAM-A < 14) at week 12 was observed in 88.1% and 96.2% of the Tenoten 4- and 8-tablet groups, respectively, with superiority of the 8-tablet regimen over placebo. Responder rates at week 12 were 69.8% and 73.8% in the 4- and 8-tablet groups, versus 53.9% with placebo.\n\nQuality of life (EQ-5D-3L) improved in all groups, with a significantly greater improvement in the Tenoten 8-tablet group compared to placebo. CGI-EI scores indicated a more favorable efficacy-to-side-effect ratio for both Tenoten regimens versus placebo.\n\nPost hoc analyses suggested that diagnostic category (F43 vs F45 vs F48) did not significantly modify the treatment-related improvement in overall HAM-A scores, although baseline and mean anxiety and somatic subscores differed across diagnoses. Changes in anxious mood and tension (HAM-A questions 1–2) were driven by treatment rather than diagnosis. Somatic symptom dynamics (HAM-A items 7–13) differed by treatment regardless of diagnosis, with notably higher somatic subscores in somatoform dysfunction (F45) patients.\n\nSafety analyses showed 46 adverse events in 37 patients (10 events in Tenoten 4-tablet, 18 in Tenoten 8-tablet, and 18 in placebo groups). AEs were predominantly mild or moderate; no serious adverse events occurred, and overall AE frequency did not differ significantly among groups. Most AEs were assessed as unrelated or unlikely related to Tenoten, with no events definitely attributed to the study drug. The safety profile was considered favorable, with a high compliance index (~100%).\n\nThe authors concluded that Tenoten at both 4- and 8-tablet daily regimens was more effective than placebo in reducing anxiety in adults with somatoform dysfunction, reactions to severe stress, adjustment disorders, and other neurotic disorders, with good tolerability. They noted limitations including inclusion of heterogeneous psychiatric diagnoses, conduct mainly in neurological centers without standardized psychiatric interviews, fixed-dose regimens without adjustment, and a relatively high placebo effect potentially influenced by investigator–patient interactions. The article has since been retracted, as noted by the publisher."
