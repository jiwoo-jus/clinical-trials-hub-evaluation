      "briefSummary": "This open-label pilot study evaluated a very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD), called Nic's Ketogenic Diet, over 140 days in healthy adults aged 30–55 years who had normal to overweight body mass index and mildly elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Participants followed a diet providing about 5% of calories from carbohydrates, 70% from fat, and 25% from protein, with energy intake set at 90% of calculated maintenance needs. The study assessed changes in body composition (body fat and muscle mass), weight, blood pressure, lipid profile, glycemic control, inflammatory markers, and thyroid hormone levels. Results showed reductions in total body fat, android and gynoid fat, body weight, BMI, systolic blood pressure, and HbA1c, along with increases in muscle mass and HDL cholesterol, despite increases in total cholesterol and LDL-C that were not considered clinically relevant. The diet was generally well tolerated and appeared safe over 140 days.",
      "detailedDescription": "This open-label, single-arm pilot trial investigated the effects of a very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD), termed Nic's Ketogenic Diet, on cardiometabolic health in adults with mildly elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The study was conducted at KGK Science, Inc. (London, Ontario, Canada) between December 2019 and October 2020, following IRB approval and registration (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04195594).\n\nEligible participants were men and women aged 30–55 years with a body mass index (BMI) between 20.0 and 29.9 kg/m² (eutrophic to overweight range), LDL-C between 2.5 and 4.1 mmol/L (above optimal to borderline high), and otherwise healthy based on medical history and laboratory tests. Key exclusions included pregnancy or breastfeeding, menopause or postmenopause, current dieting, diabetes, hypertension or use of antihypertensive medications, recent major cardiovascular events, kidney or liver disease, use of statins or other drugs and supplements affecting blood pressure, weight, or lipid metabolism, and any unstable medical condition that could interfere with study completion or safety.\n\nThe intervention consisted of a VLCKD providing approximately 5% of total energy from carbohydrates, 70% from fat, and 25% from protein. Daily energy needs were estimated using the Harris–Benedict equation and then multiplied by 0.9 to provide 90% of maintenance caloric requirements, promoting moderate energy deficit without explicit calorie restriction. Participants received detailed dietary counseling from a registered dietitian, an e-book, and additional educational materials. They were instructed to avoid sweeteners, most fruits (except berries), starchy vegetables, low-fat dairy, soy, grains, beans, and alcohol, while emphasizing green leafy and cruciferous vegetables, avocado, eggs, meat, seafood, fermented foods, high-fat dairy, and organic/grass-fed fats and oils. Mindful eating and intermittent fasting were encouraged.\n\nStudy assessments occurred at Day 0 (baseline), 28, 56, 70, 84, 112, and 140. At each visit, weight and blood pressure were measured, and fasting blood samples were collected for lipid analyses (total cholesterol [TC], LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides [TG]). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans and BMI measurements were performed at baseline, Day 70, and Day 140 to determine body composition, including total body fat percentage, android and gynoid fat, android/gynoid fat ratio, and muscle mass percentage. At baseline and Day 140, additional blood tests were conducted for fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and free triiodothyronine (T3), along with standard safety labs and electrocardiograms.\n\nCompliance was evaluated using weekly 3-day food records (3DFR) completed via the Libro application and daily home monitoring of blood glucose and ketone levels (KetoMojo). Participants received ongoing nutrition counseling by phone and email based on review of their food records and biochemical markers. Mean dietary intake over 140 days closely matched the intended macronutrient distribution, with reported carbohydrate intake around 5–7% of calories, fat around 69–72%, and protein around 23%. Daily energy intake was reduced by approximately 594 kcal compared to preintervention intake, despite no formal calorie restriction. Mean fasting ketone concentrations increased from 0.52 mmol/L preintervention to 0.81 mmol/L at Day 140, and the glucose ketone index declined from 13.77 to 8.78, indicating a state of nutritional ketosis.\n\nThe primary outcomes were changes in body composition measures from baseline to Day 70 and Day 140: total body fat percentage, android and gynoid fat percentage, android/gynoid fat ratio, and muscle mass percentage, assessed via DEXA. Secondary outcomes included changes from baseline to Day 140 in ESR, CRP, HbA1c, fasting glucose, and T3. Additional exploratory outcomes included changes in body weight, BMI, blood pressure, and detailed lipid parameters over time. Safety was monitored via adverse event (AE) reporting, clinical chemistry, hematology, electrolytes, liver and kidney function tests, heart rate, and ECG.\n\nA total of 40 volunteers were screened and 14 were enrolled; 11 completed the 140-day intervention. Participants were on average 30–53 years of age, 50% female, predominantly of European ethnicity, with no current smokers and occasional alcohol consumption in most participants.\n\nBody composition improved significantly over the study. Total body fat percentage decreased by 2.25% at Day 70 and 4.41% at Day 140 relative to baseline. Both android and gynoid fat percentages declined, resulting in a significant reduction in the android/gynoid fat ratio, a marker linked to metabolic syndrome and cardiometabolic risk. Muscle mass percentage increased by 2.24% at Day 70 and 4.38% at Day 140, indicating that weight loss was largely due to fat mass rather than lean mass loss. Weight loss was evident by Day 28 and remained significant at all subsequent time points. By Day 56 there was a 5.65% reduction in body weight, reaching a 10.65% reduction by Day 140. BMI decreased by 6.2% at Day 70 and 10.6% at Day 140, with mean BMI shifting from overweight (26.27 kg/m²) at baseline to within the normal range (23.31 kg/m²) by Day 140.\n\nLipid parameters changed in a complex manner. Total cholesterol increased significantly at all postbaseline visits, and LDL-C increased significantly at all time points, although values remained within the acceptable lab range for this population and increases were judged not clinically relevant within the context of the study. HDL-C increased by 12.8% at Day 140, a change considered clinically meaningful due to its association with reduced cardiovascular risk. Triglycerides and the TG/HDL-C ratio did not change significantly. The TC/HDL-C ratio was transiently elevated at intermediate visits but was not significantly different from baseline at Day 140. Exploratory analysis suggested that at Day 140 all participants displayed a lipid profile consistent with a nonatherogenic LDL phenotype A, driven primarily by high HDL-C and low TG/HDL-C ratios, although LDL subclass measurements were not directly obtained.\n\nSystolic blood pressure decreased by about 5.3% (6.52 mmHg) from baseline to Day 140, a magnitude associated in the literature with reduced cardiovascular disease risk. Diastolic blood pressure showed a transient increase at Day 28 but no significant differences at later time points. HbA1c decreased significantly (approximately 4% relative improvement) by Day 140, while fasting glucose, ESR, and CRP did not change significantly. Free T3 levels decreased, which may be related to both the ketogenic diet and weight loss and could influence LDL-C clearance. Dietary cholesterol intake increased by over 300 mg/day during the VLCKD, and may also have contributed to the observed elevations in serum cholesterol.\n\nSafety assessments indicated that the VLCKD was generally well tolerated over 140 days. There were 44 postbaseline adverse events, 13 of which were considered possibly related to the diet. Diet-related adverse events were predominantly gastrointestinal (constipation, diarrhea, heartburn, nausea, vomiting) and all resolved by study end. Clinical chemistry, hematology, electrolyte levels, and liver and kidney function tests remained within normal clinical reference ranges or were considered not clinically significant. No clinically relevant ECG or heart rate changes were observed.\n\nThe study supports that a carefully designed VLCKD can produce substantial weight and fat loss, favorable changes in body fat distribution, improved muscle mass, reductions in HbA1c and systolic blood pressure, and increases in HDL-C in normal-weight to overweight adults with mildly elevated LDL-C. However, total cholesterol and LDL-C levels increased, and the long-term cardiovascular implications of these changes require further investigation, especially with respect to LDL particle size and subclasses. The study was limited by its open-label, single-arm design, small sample size, and short to medium-term duration, which restricts generalizability and causal inference. The authors recommend larger, randomized controlled trials with longer follow-up, assessment of LDL particle characteristics, gut microbiota, and micronutrient status, and evaluation of transition strategies from VLCKD to long-term maintenance diets in populations at higher cardiovascular risk."
