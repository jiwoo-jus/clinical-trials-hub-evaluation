      "briefSummary": "This single-blind, randomized clinical trial studied weight loss patterns in overweight and obese women treated with twice‑daily exenatide injections compared with a hypocaloric diet plus matched placebo injections. One hundred eighty‑two women (BMI 25–48 kg/m², without diabetes) were randomized 3:2 to exenatide or to dietary counseling with placebo injections for up to 52 weeks. Participants who lost at least 5% of their body weight by 12 weeks were classified as high responders and continued, while those achieving at least 10% loss at any time were classified as super responders. The main goal was to compare longer‑term weight change among early high responders in each group, and to identify clinical and metabolomic factors associated with greater weight loss. The study found that, among early responders, longer‑term weight loss with exenatide was similar to that achieved with a hypocaloric diet, and that greater early weight loss predicted later \"super responder\" status in both groups.",
      "detailedDescription": "This study was a 52‑week, single‑blind, randomized interventional trial designed to characterize weight loss responses to twice‑daily exenatide versus a hypocaloric diet with matched placebo injections in women with overweight or obesity but without diabetes. The primary objective was to assess long‑term changes in body weight among individuals who demonstrated an early robust weight loss (high responders) with either treatment. Secondary objectives included evaluation of changes in metabolic parameters (waist circumference, lipid profile, resting energy expenditure, body composition, and thermic effect of food) and exploratory analysis of metabolomic predictors of treatment response.\n\nA total of 249 women were screened and 182 enrolled. Eligible participants were 18–70 years old with BMI 25.0–48 kg/m², without acute or poorly controlled chronic disease, and without diabetes, prior exenatide use, or history of pancreatitis. Participants were randomized 3:2 to exenatide (n=127) or to hypocaloric diet plus placebo injections (n=55). Exenatide was administered as self‑injected subcutaneous doses titrated to a maximum of 10 µg twice daily; the control group received matched placebo injections plus structured nutrition counseling with a prescribed ~500 kcal/day deficit based on measured resting metabolic rate. Both groups were instructed to maintain their usual physical activity; only the diet group received ongoing dietary counseling. Neither group received specific exercise counseling beyond maintaining current routines.\n\nStudy visits occurred every 2 weeks during the first month and every 4 weeks thereafter. Participants were included in the main analysis if they completed at least 12 weeks of treatment (exenatide n=75, diet n=33). At 12 weeks, women in either arm who had lost ≥5% of their baseline body weight were classified as high responders and continued in the study up to 52 weeks; those who did not meet this threshold were classified as low responders and were discontinued per protocol. Participants in either arm who lost ≥10% of baseline weight at any time were categorized as super responders.\n\nAt each visit, blinded study staff measured body weight, waist circumference, vital signs, and body composition using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Comprehensive metabolic evaluations were performed at baseline and at weeks 12, 24, and 52, including fasting blood tests (hematology, electrolytes, lipids), resting metabolic rate via indirect calorimetry, and thermic effect of food (TEF) using a standardized liquid meal. Serial postprandial triglyceride and insulin levels were measured following the test meal.\n\nAn exploratory targeted metabolomics sub‑study used LC‑MS to quantify ~150 endogenous polar metabolites and acylcarnitines in baseline fasting plasma samples from exenatide high and low responders and from diet responders. Metabolite peak intensities were log‑transformed, quality‑controlled by coefficients of variation, and analyzed using nonparametric statistics to compare responders vs non‑responders and super responders vs responders in each treatment arm.\n\nThe trial found substantial inter‑individual variability in weight loss trajectories in both treatment arms. After 12 weeks, 56% of exenatide‑treated and 76% of diet/placebo participants were high responders. Peak absolute and percentage weight loss were similar between exenatide and diet high responders, but the diet group exhibited a wider range of maximum weight loss and a numerically higher proportion of super responders (23% exenatide vs 36% diet, not statistically significant). In both arms, greater early weight loss (at 3 months) predicted super responder status, while baseline age, BMI, weight, waist circumference, total cholesterol, and resting energy expenditure did not reliably predict high responder status. Both groups showed significant reductions in waist circumference, resting energy expenditure, and triglycerides among high responders, with additional improvements in insulin, systolic blood pressure, and percent body fat confined to diet high responders. Exenatide high and low responders both showed reductions in total and LDL cholesterol, suggesting potential lipid effects beyond weight loss alone.\n\nExenatide treatment, but not diet, led to a significant reduction in thermic effect of food over 12 weeks in both high and low responders, consistent with known GLP‑1 receptor agonist effects such as delayed gastric emptying. Despite similar total weight loss among early responders, diet responders tended to show less weight regain and more pronounced improvements in some metabolic parameters, possibly reflecting durable lifestyle changes.\n\nThe metabolomics analysis indicated that lower baseline cysteine levels were associated with subsequent weight loss response to exenatide. Compared with diet responders, exenatide responders had higher baseline glucose, caffeine, and C6 acylcarnitine. Within treatment arms, diet high responders had higher baseline niacinamide, anthranilic acid, and glycerol, whereas exenatide high responders and super responders tended to have higher levels of metabolites such as anandamide, sarcosine, aminoisobutyric acid, serotonin, and certain acylcarnitines, suggesting potential biologic pathways linked to appetite and energy metabolism. These metabolomic findings are exploratory and limited by small sample size.\n\nCommon adverse events included nausea, decreased appetite, and headache, with nausea and appetite suppression more frequent in the exenatide group. Dropout rates by week 12 were about 40% in both arms, primarily occurring early after randomization, but were lower after 12 weeks among continuing responders.\n\nOverall, in women with overweight or obesity who achieved early robust weight loss, prolonged exenatide therapy produced weight loss outcomes comparable to those achieved with a hypocaloric diet plus placebo injections. The magnitude of early weight loss was a key predictor of achieving ≥10% long‑term weight loss for both exenatide and diet. The results suggest that while exenatide has specific metabolic effects, including on lipids and TEF, its net weight loss effect in early responders resembles that of structured dietary energy restriction in this population. Larger and more diverse studies are needed to clarify predictors of response and patterns of weight regain with GLP‑1 receptor agonists versus lifestyle interventions."
