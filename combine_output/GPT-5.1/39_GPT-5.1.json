      "briefSummary": "This study develops and implements a 6‑month, culturally sensitive text‑messaging intervention to support hypertension self‑management among African American Veterans. Building on prior work using video‑recorded peer storytelling, the investigators transform key quotations from five African American Veteran storytellers into brief narrative SMS messages. These narrative texts are combined with educational and interactive (two‑way) messages within the Veterans Affairs Annie texting platform, with the aim of reinforcing lifestyle changes, medication adherence, and other self‑management behaviors between clinic visits. Each texting protocol corresponds to one Veteran storyteller, allowing participants to select the story that best resonates with their own experiences. A randomized trial is underway to evaluate the effect of this intervention on lifestyle behaviors and blood pressure control.",
      "detailedDescription": "The study focuses on extending the impact of an existing peer‑storytelling intervention for African American Veterans with hypertension by integrating story‑based content into a longitudinal mobile health (mHealth) texting program. Prior work showed that video narratives from African American Veterans improved emotional engagement and intentions to change hypertension‑related behaviors but did not produce sustained improvements in blood pressure after a one‑time viewing. To address this, the research team designed a series of structured text‑messaging protocols to 'continue the conversation' initiated by the videos.\n\nUsing the Department of Veterans Affairs Annie SMS texting platform, the team created five separate 6‑month protocols, each aligned with one of five previously recorded Veteran storytellers who had successfully managed uncontrolled hypertension. The protocol design was informed by Social Cognitive Theory, emphasizing self‑efficacy, behavioral capability, and reinforcement. The text content is organized around key hypertension self‑management domains (eg, medication taking, salt intake, physical activity, blood pressure monitoring, use of social support), which had been identified during the initial development of the video narratives.\n\nText messages fall into three categories: (1) narrative messages that incorporate quotations or paraphrased micro‑stories drawn from the storytellers’ transcripts; (2) educational messages that provide guideline‑based information from sources such as the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and (3) interactive two‑way messages that query patients about their self‑efficacy and performance of specific self‑management behaviors, using preset response formats. The interactive messages return tailored, automated feedback and often include links to additional resources, such as American Heart Association or VA educational webpages.\n\nTo create narrative texts, the team systematically reviewed full story transcripts, identified longer segments that expressed core self‑management concepts and narrative elements, and then distilled these into 160‑character SMS messages while striving to preserve each storyteller’s voice. Because the Annie system requires brevity and inclusion of an \"Annie\" identifier in every message, considerable editing and iterative review were necessary. Some storytellers did not speak to every key content area; in such cases, narrative texts from other storytellers were used, with wording that clearly indicated they came from 'a Veteran who shared his story with us' rather than the participant’s selected storyteller.\n\nTwo African American Veteran consultants played a central role in refining both language and protocol structure. They advised on cultural sensitivity, appropriate tone, and how to convey authenticity without perpetuating stigma. For example, although early drafts attempted to mirror vernacular spellings (eg, 'hafta', 'gonna'), consultants recommended using standard spelling to avoid reinforcing negative stereotypes and to respect Veterans who may have experienced educational inequities or stigmatization related to speech patterns. Consultants also suggested structuring each 2‑week content block so that the first week emphasized educational texts (to 'see if they can do it themselves') and the second week reintroduced the storyteller’s voice through narrative messages to re‑engage participants.\n\nThe final 26‑week protocol is organized into nine key content area blocks, with two high‑priority topics (salt intake and medication taking) repeated because of their broad relevance and rich narrative content. Each 2‑week block includes eight messages spaced across 14 days and begins and ends with interactive texts that serve as 'bookends': the first assesses self‑efficacy related to that content area, while the second assesses recent behavior and offers additional VA resource suggestions. After every four content blocks (approximately every 8 weeks), an all‑interactive 'check‑in' week is inserted to reassess overall confidence in managing blood pressure and to prompt reflection on behaviors performed during that week.\n\nMessages are scheduled for delivery at 11 AM and 3 PM to accommodate Veterans working varied shifts, based on consultant feedback. The Annie platform’s constraints—such as fixed character limits, required inclusion of the word 'Annie', lack of open‑ended interactive responses, and non‑trivial customization of send times—shaped both message content and implementation strategy. The researchers collaborated with VA operational partners and experienced Annie users to optimize message design within these constraints.\n\nThe intervention is being piloted and then tested in a randomized controlled trial among African American Veterans with hypertension (Trial Registration: NCT03970590). Participants will view all five storyteller videos (now often delivered virtually, especially during the COVID‑19 pandemic), choose the storyteller with whom they most identify, and then be assigned to the corresponding 6‑month texting protocol. Outcomes of interest include changes in self‑efficacy, hypertension self‑management behaviors (such as medication adherence and diet), and blood pressure control. The overarching objective is to deliver a scalable, low‑cost, culturally sensitive mHealth intervention that addresses mistrust, supports long‑term behavior change, and helps reduce racial disparities in hypertension‑related morbidity and mortality among Veterans."
