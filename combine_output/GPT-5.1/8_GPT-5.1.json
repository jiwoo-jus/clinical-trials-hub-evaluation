      "briefSummary": "This is a two-arm, individually randomised controlled trial in Kenya evaluating Mobile WACh NEO, an interactive (two-way) SMS messaging intervention for pregnant women and new mothers. About 5000 women in their third trimester are randomised 1:1 to receive tailored SMS messages during pregnancy and up to 6 weeks after delivery, or to receive no SMS (standard care). The messages provide information, motivation and behavioural skills to support essential newborn care, early recognition of neonatal danger signs, appropriate care-seeking, and maternal psychosocial well-being. The main hypothesis is that the SMS intervention will reduce neonatal mortality by improving essential newborn care practices, timely care-seeking, maternal social support, self-efficacy and reducing perinatal depression.",
      "detailedDescription": "Mobile WACh NEO is a multisite, parallel-group, superiority randomised controlled trial conducted at six health facilities in Kenya (urban Nairobi and rural Western Kenya). The trial targets pregnant women aged 14 years and older who are 28–36 weeks’ gestation, enrolled in antenatal care at a study site, have daily access to a Safaricom mobile phone, are willing to receive SMS, plan to remain in the area for at least 5 months, and are not enrolled in another study. Literacy is not required if a trusted person can read and send messages on the participant’s behalf.\n\nParticipants (n=5000) are randomised 1:1 to an interactive two-way SMS intervention (Mobile WACh NEO) or a control group with no study SMS. Randomisation is stratified by site, uses variable block sizes, and is implemented via a web-based system; participants and site staff are unblinded, but investigators are blinded to aggregate results until study completion.\n\nThe intervention consists of semi-automated, tailored SMS messages informed by the Information-Motivation-Behaviour Skills (IMB) model. Messages are sent in English, Kiswahili or Dholuo according to participant preference and are tailored to gestational age or postpartum age, with different frequencies across periods: weekly from enrolment until 38 weeks’ gestation, daily from 38 weeks to delivery, twice daily from delivery to 2 weeks postpartum, and every other day from 2 to 6 weeks postpartum. Content focuses on essential newborn care (ENC)—including early and exclusive breastfeeding, thermal care, delayed bathing, clean cord care, and kangaroo mother care for preterm/low birth weight infants—identification of neonatal danger signs, birth planning and facility delivery, and maternal mental health, social support and self-efficacy. Messages are interactive and typically contain questions prompting engagement.\n\nParticipants in the intervention arm can send SMS at any time; trained study nurses respond during business hours using a human–computer hybrid platform that supports two-way communication, templated responses for common issues, and triage. Nurses prioritise messages indicating maternal or neonatal danger signs, serious adverse events, or home delivery, and refer participants to facility care when appropriate. Participants reporting intimate partner violence, suicidal ideation, severe depressive symptoms or severe food insecurity are referred to local resources. High-risk messaging tracks provide additional tailored content for first-time or very young mothers (≤19 years), women screening positive for elevated depressive symptoms, and mothers of preterm or low birth weight infants. If a pregnancy or infant loss occurs, automated messages stop and women are offered an alternative track with supportive condolence messages and no pregnancy or infant-care content.\n\nThe primary outcome is neonatal mortality, defined as death within the first 28 days after a live birth, ascertained from clinic records and maternal report, with verbal autopsy conducted for infant deaths. Secondary outcomes include: early neonatal mortality (death within 7 days); early initiation of breastfeeding (within 1 hour of birth); delayed bathing (≥24 hours after birth); avoidance of substances on the umbilical cord; time to cessation of breastfeeding; provision of kangaroo mother care for preterm or low birth weight infants; maternal knowledge of neonatal danger signs; maternal depressive symptoms measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; social support measured by the MOS Social Support Scale; and parenting self-efficacy measured by the Karitane Parenting Confidence Scale. Exploratory analyses will evaluate relationships between maternal mental health, ENC practices, care-seeking, and intervention engagement.\n\nData are collected at enrolment (third trimester) and at 2 and 6 weeks postpartum via tablet-based questionnaires, supplemented by abstraction of clinical records (including maternity registers, maternal and child health booklets, and hospital discharge forms). Follow-up visits are conducted in conjunction with routine clinical visits when possible or via phone; home tracing is employed when needed, though in-person home visits were suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic according to national guidance.\n\nThe planned sample size of 5000 participants provides 80% power (alpha=0.05, assuming 10% attrition) to detect a risk ratio of ≤0.53 in neonatal mortality, based on an assumed control-arm neonatal mortality rate of 23 per 1000 live births. Power calculations for secondary outcomes are based on Bonferroni adjustment; analyses of secondary endpoints will ultimately use Benjamini–Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons. The primary analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle and use log-binomial regression for risk outcomes, Cox proportional hazards for breastfeeding duration, Poisson models for counts, and linear models for continuous psychosocial scores, with generalised estimating equations where appropriate. Sensitivity analyses will explore the impact of loss to follow-up on neonatal mortality, and an exploratory per-protocol analysis will exclude women who discontinue the SMS intervention. An interim analysis for neonatal mortality is planned using O’Brien–Fleming stopping boundaries when approximately 50% of person-time has accrued.\n\nSafety is monitored via systematic collection of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), including pregnancy loss, maternal or infant hospitalisation or death. SAEs are reported promptly to relevant ethics committees. A Data Safety Monitoring Board composed of independent experts in biostatistics, maternal–child health, paediatrics and mHealth oversees trial safety.\n\nThe trial is approved by institutional review boards at the University of Washington, Women and Infants Hospital, and Kenyatta National Hospital/University of Nairobi, and is registered under NCT04598165. The investigators plan to disseminate findings through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and policy briefs for Kenyan health authorities, with the goal of informing scalable strategies to reduce neonatal mortality and improve maternal and newborn health in resource-limited settings."

From enrollment to 38 weeks, weekly SMS focus on facility delivery, birth planning, neonatal danger signs, and emotional support. From 38 weeks to delivery, daily SMS emphasize identification of neonatal danger signs and essential newborn care (ENC) practices (immediate and exclusive breastfeeding, thermal and cord care). From delivery to 2 weeks postpartum, two messages per day are sent: one with screening questions for neonatal danger signs and prompting contact with nurses, and one with educational and psychosocial content. From 2 to 6 weeks postpartum, messages are sent every other day. Participants can send SMS at any time to study nurses, who respond during business hours using a human–computer hybrid platform, triage clinical concerns, and refer participants to facility care when danger signs or serious issues are reported. All SMS sending/receiving is free to participants; standard Ministry of Health antenatal and maternal–child health services continue as usual.",
