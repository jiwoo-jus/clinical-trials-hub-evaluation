      "briefSummary": "This multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 trial (ORIENT-4; NCT03228836) evaluated the efficacy and safety of sintilimab, a humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, in patients with relapsed or refractory extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL) who had previously failed at least one asparaginase-based regimen. Twenty-eight adults with measurable ENKTL received sintilimab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 24 months. The main goal was to see how many patients had tumor shrinkage (objective response rate) using Lugano 2014 criteria. Sintilimab achieved a high response rate with durable overall survival and a mostly mild to moderate side-effect profile, suggesting it may be an effective and tolerable treatment option for this difficult-to-treat lymphoma.",
      "detailedDescription": "ORIENT-4 is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 clinical trial conducted at six hospitals in China to assess sintilimab, a recombinant humanized anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody, in patients with relapsed or refractory extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (r/r ENKTL). ENKTL is an aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by frequent Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) association, poor response to conventional anthracycline-based chemotherapy, and limited options after failure of asparaginase-based regimens, where median survival is typically less than 6 months.\n\nKey eligibility criteria included age 18–70 years, histologically confirmed ENKTL with at least one measurable lesion (>15 mm or positive 18F-FDG PET uptake), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0–2, adequate organ and bone marrow function, prior receipt of at least one asparaginase-based chemotherapy regimen (with local radiotherapy for stage I/II disease), and relapse or refractoriness to previous treatment. Exclusion criteria included aggressive NK-cell leukemia, primary or secondary central nervous system lymphoma, severe hemophagocytic syndrome at initial diagnosis, and prior exposure to checkpoint inhibitors.\n\nPatients received sintilimab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until disease progression, death, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or completion of 24 months of therapy. Treatment beyond radiologic progression was permitted when investigators suspected pseudo-progression based on imaging, laboratory markers, and clinical status. Tumor assessments used 18F-FDG PET at baseline and weeks 6, 15, and 24, and contrast-enhanced CT at baseline, weeks 24, 36, 48, and every 24 weeks thereafter, with responses evaluated according to Lugano 2014 criteria. The best overall response was defined as the best response from treatment start to progression or relapse.\n\nThe primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR = complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) to sintilimab monotherapy. Secondary endpoints included CR and PR rates, disease control rate (DCR = CR + PR + stable disease), time to response (TTR), duration of response (DOR), overall survival (OS) at 1 and 2 years, safety, and health-related quality of life measured using EQ-5D-5L and EORTC QLQ-C30. Safety was graded by CTCAE v4.03. Anti-drug antibody (ADA) and neutralizing antibody (NAb) sampling was performed longitudinally.\n\nFrom August 31, 2017 to February 7, 2018, 34 patients were screened and 28 enrolled; all had failed asparaginase-based treatment. The median age was 37 years; most patients had advanced disease (67.9% stage IV), ECOG PS 1–2 (89.3%), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (64.3%), and a median of 3 prior lines of chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 30.4 months, the ORR was 75.0% (21/28; 95% CI 55.1–89.3%), incorporating 5 patients with initial apparent progression later deemed pseudo-progression. CR and PR rates were 21.4% and 53.6%, respectively, and the DCR was 85.7% (95% CI 67.3–96.0%). Median TTR was 1.3 months (95% CI 1.3–3.4), and median DOR was 4.1 months (95% CI 2.1–15.2). Subgroup analyses suggested higher ORR in patients with normal lactate dehydrogenase and without bone marrow involvement.\n\nSeven deaths occurred by data cut-off. The 1-year OS rate was 82.1% (95% CI 62.3–92.1%) and the 2-year OS rate was 78.6% (95% CI 58.4–89.8%), with median OS not reached. Pseudo-progression and fluctuating radiologic responses, such as transient new lesions or increased FDG uptake followed by regression, were observed in a notable subset of patients and were not associated with inferior survival, highlighting the need for cautious interpretation of early imaging under PD-1 blockade and potentially extended response assessment windows beyond the conventional 4–6 months.\n\nSafety analyses showed that 96.4% of patients experienced at least one treatment-related adverse event (TRAE), most of which were grade 1–2. The most frequent TRAEs included decreased lymphocyte count, pyrexia, and decreased white blood cell count. Only one grade 4 TRAE (diabetes) was reported, and no grade 5 TRAEs occurred. Serious adverse events were seen in 25.0% of patients, with only ketoacidosis considered related to sintilimab. Two TRAEs (diabetes and thrombocytopenia) led to treatment discontinuation. No positive ADA or infusion-related reactions were detected. Overall, the safety profile compared favorably with conventional chemotherapy regimens used in ENKTL.\n\nQuality-of-life scores improved during therapy, with significant gains in EQ-5D-5L index, EQ-5D-5L visual analog scale, and EORTC QLQ-C30 scores starting around weeks 15–24 and maintained through extended follow-up.\n\nA retrospective historical control cohort of 46 patients with r/r ENKTL who failed asparaginase-based regimens showed an ORR of 32.8% and median OS of 4.8 months, underscoring the poor prognosis with conventional salvage therapies. Compared with these data and other reported regimens, sintilimab monotherapy demonstrated a higher response rate and encouraging long-term survival.\n\nThe study was designed to test the hypothesis that sintilimab could achieve an ORR greater than 30% in r/r ENKTL; with the lower bound of the 95% CI for ORR exceeding 30%, this hypothesis was met despite early termination of enrollment at 28 patients. Limitations include the single-arm design, reliance on investigator-based response assessment using Lugano 2014 criteria (which may not optimally capture immune-related response patterns), incomplete planned sample size, and heterogeneous post-trial treatments. Nonetheless, ORIENT-4 provides prospective evidence that sintilimab is active and generally well tolerated in r/r ENKTL, supporting further evaluation of sintilimab-based regimens, including combination approaches, in this population."
