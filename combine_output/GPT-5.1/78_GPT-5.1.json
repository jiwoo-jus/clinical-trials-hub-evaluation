      "briefSummary": "This phase 1/2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (NCT04568031) evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of the AZD1222 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) COVID-19 vaccine in Japanese adults who were seronegative for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 256 participants aged 18 years and older were stratified into three age groups (18–55, 56–69, and ≥70 years) and randomized 3:1 to receive two intramuscular doses of AZD1222 or saline placebo 4 weeks apart. The main goals were to assess whether AZD1222 could induce antibody responses against the SARS-CoV-2 spike and receptor-binding domain (RBD) antigens and neutralizing antibodies, and to characterize local and systemic adverse events, serious adverse events, and laboratory safety parameters up to Day 57. AZD1222 induced strong humoral immune responses across all age groups and showed an acceptable safety profile without vaccine-related serious adverse events or deaths.",
      "detailedDescription": "This ongoing phase 1/2, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multi-centre clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04568031) was designed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of the replication-deficient simian adenovirus–vectored vaccine AZD1222 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) in Japanese adults. The trial is conducted at five centres in Japan, with planned follow-up of 1 year after first dosing; the current report covers data up to Day 57.\n\nEligible participants were adults aged 18 years or older who were seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 at screening and had a negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test. Individuals with a history of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, pregnant women, those with new-onset fever, significant immunodeficiency, recent or planned receipt of vaccines that could interfere with interpretation, or severe/uncontrolled comorbidities were excluded. Mild to moderate, well-controlled comorbidities were permitted.\n\nParticipants were stratified into age cohorts: 18–55 years and ≥56 years, with the ≥56-year cohort further divided into 56–69 years and ≥70 years; approximately 30% of the ≥56-year cohort were aged ≥70 years. Within each cohort, participants were randomized in a 3:1 ratio using an Interactive Response Technology system to receive either AZD1222 or placebo (0.9% saline). AZD1222 was given as two intramuscular injections of 5 × 10^10 viral particles per dose into the deltoid muscle on Days 1 and 29. Study drug preparation was done by an unblinded pharmacist, while participants, investigators, and sponsor staff remained blinded until safety data lock at Day 57.\n\nThe coprimary endpoints were: (1) immunogenicity, defined as seroresponse to the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen at Day 57 (≥4-fold rise in anti-spike antibody titre vs Day 1 baseline); and (2) safety, including solicited local and systemic reactogenicity during the first 6 days after each dose, unsolicited adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and adverse events of special interest (AESIs) for 28 days after each dose, and changes from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters.\n\nImmunogenicity assessments included measurement of anti-spike, anti-RBD, and anti-nucleocapsid antibodies using a validated multiplex electrochemiluminescent assay, and neutralizing antibodies using a validated HIV-1–based pseudovirus neutralization assay. Samples for serology were collected on Days 1, 15, 29, 43, and 57; neutralizing antibody samples were collected on Days 1, 29, and 57. The fully vaccinated analysis set included participants who received both doses, had no major protocol deviations affecting immune response interpretation, and did not show nucleocapsid seroresponse (which would suggest intercurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection) up to Day 57.\n\nSafety assessments included 30 minutes of post-vaccination observation, participant-recorded solicited local and systemic AEs for 6 days after each dose using electronic diaries, and unsolicited AEs for 28 days after each dose. Clinical laboratory safety (haematology and chemistry) was evaluated on Days 1, 8, 29, 36, and 57. AE severity was graded using scales adapted from U.S. FDA toxicity grading guidance. Analyses were descriptive, with Fisher’s exact test used to compare seroresponse proportions and neutralizing antibody response rates between AZD1222 and placebo at a two-sided 5% alpha level; no multiplicity adjustment was performed.\n\nAmong 256 enrolled participants (192 AZD1222 and 64 placebo in the total vaccinated analysis set), baseline characteristics were balanced between groups. All participants were Japanese. The prevalence of key comorbidities at baseline included hypertension (approximately 27%), obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m^2; about 4%), cardiac disorders, and type 1 or type 2 diabetes at lower frequencies.\n\nFor the coprimary immunogenicity endpoint, 100% (174/174) of participants who received two doses of AZD1222 achieved seroresponse to the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen at Day 57, compared with 0% (0/60) in the placebo group (P<0.001 in both age cohorts). Similarly, seroresponse to the RBD antigen at Day 57 was observed in 100% (174/174) of AZD1222 recipients and 0% of placebo recipients. Anti-spike and anti-RBD antibody titres rose substantially after the first dose (Day 29), increased further after the second dose, peaked around Day 43, and remained above pre–second-dose levels at Day 57 across all age cohorts.\n\nNeutralizing antibody responses at Day 57 (defined as ≥4-fold increase vs baseline) were seen in 67.5% of AZD1222 recipients aged 18–55 years, 60.3% aged 56–69 years, and 50.0% aged ≥70 years, with no neutralizing antibody responses in placebo groups. Corresponding neutralizing antibody geometric mean titres (GMTs) at Day 57 were 107.3 (95% CI 84.2–136.7) for 18–55 years, 101.5 (95% CI 74.3–138.5) for 56–69 years, and 70.2 (95% CI 45.6–108.1) for ≥70 years. There was a trend toward lower titres with increasing age, though confidence intervals overlapped. In placebo recipients, antibody titres to spike and RBD and neutralizing antibodies remained at baseline levels.\n\nFor the coprimary safety endpoints, solicited AEs within 6 days of any dose occurred more frequently in AZD1222 recipients than in placebo recipients and were generally mild to moderate. In the 18–55-year cohort, solicited AEs were reported by 85.4% of AZD1222 and 37.5% of placebo recipients; in the 56–69-year group, by 72.3% and 19.0%, respectively; and in the ≥70-year group, by 51.6% and 27.3%, respectively. The most common solicited local AEs were pain and tenderness at the injection site; common systemic AEs included malaise, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, and elevated body temperature. Severe solicited AEs were observed in 9.4% of AZD1222 recipients aged 18–55 years but not in older age groups, and no potentially life-threatening solicited AEs were reported. Reactogenicity tended to be more frequent after the first dose than the second, and was milder and less frequent in participants aged ≥70 years compared with younger adults.\n\nUnsolicited AEs occurring within 28 days after each dose were reported by 28.1%, 21.5%, and 22.6% of AZD1222 recipients aged 18–55, 56–69, and ≥70 years, respectively, versus 9.4%, 28.6%, and 27.3% of placebo recipients in the corresponding age groups. Most unsolicited AEs were mild or moderate, with severe events infrequent and observed in small numbers of both AZD1222 and placebo recipients. The most common unsolicited AEs were consistent with post-vaccination reactions such as injection site pain and tenderness, fatigue, and elevated body temperature. There were no notable imbalances for events not typically associated with vaccination.\n\nNo deaths, vaccine-related SAEs, or AESIs were observed in AZD1222 recipients up to Day 57. One SAE (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3) occurred in a placebo recipient and was considered unrelated to study intervention. Clinical laboratory assessments showed no clinically meaningful differences between AZD1222 and placebo groups. A transient grade 3 neutrophil decrease in one AZD1222 recipient resolved without sequelae, and no clinically relevant changes in platelet counts were seen.\n\nThe study demonstrates that AZD1222 induces robust humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD antigens, as well as neutralizing antibodies, in Japanese adults including older adults, and has an acceptable short-term safety and reactogenicity profile. Immunogenicity results were generally consistent with those observed in non-Japanese populations, particularly in trials with similar dose intervals. Longer-term follow-up and additional data from other studies and real-world use are needed to fully characterize durability of immune responses, cellular immunity, and clinical efficacy, including in special populations not included in this trial."
