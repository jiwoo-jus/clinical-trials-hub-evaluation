      "briefSummary": "This is a 9‑month, quadruple‑blinded, pilot randomized controlled trial evaluating whether a single 5 mg intravenous infusion of zoledronic acid, given 6–8 weeks after sleeve gastrectomy, can prevent bone loss compared with placebo. Thirty adults undergoing sleeve gastrectomy are randomized 1:1 to zoledronic acid or saline. All participants receive standardized calcium and vitamin D supplementation. The main outcome is change in bone mineral density at the total hip over 9 months. Secondary measures include bone density at the femoral neck and lumbar spine, volumetric lumbar spine bone density and strength by quantitative CT and finite element analysis, bone turnover markers, body composition, physical function, and feasibility (adverse events, side effects, compliance). The study focuses on adults undergoing sleeve gastrectomy who are free of major bone disorders and have adequate baseline calcium and vitamin D levels.",
      "detailedDescription": "This pilot, quadruple‑blinded, randomized controlled trial investigates whether a one‑time intravenous infusion of zoledronic acid can mitigate bone loss that occurs after sleeve gastrectomy (SG), a commonly performed bariatric surgery for obesity. SG is associated with rapid weight loss but also with clinically significant reductions in bone mineral density (BMD), particularly at the hip and femoral neck, comparable to several years of postmenopausal bone loss and potentially increasing fracture risk.\n\nAdults (≥19 years) scheduled to undergo SG at a single academic bariatric center are screened and enrolled if they weigh <350 lbs (158.8 kg), have adequate serum calcium and 25‑hydroxyvitamin D levels, and are free of major bone‑impacting diseases or medications. Women must be postmenopausal or otherwise incapable of childbearing (e.g., with documented non‑hormonal intrauterine devices), given potential fetal risks from zoledronic acid. Exclusion criteria include prior bariatric surgery, significant liver or renal disease, mineral metabolism abnormalities (hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia), vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL), bone‑modifying disorders, use of bone‑active medications, bisphosphonate sensitivity, recent or planned extensive dental work, type 1 diabetes, current malignancy, and autoimmune diseases affecting bone (such as rheumatoid arthritis).\n\nParticipants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio, using computer‑generated block randomization stratified by sex, to receive either zoledronic acid 5 mg or placebo (normal saline). The study drug is administered as a 100 mL intravenous infusion over 30 minutes, 6–8 weeks after SG. The trial is quadruple‑blinded: participants, care providers, investigators, and outcomes assessors are unaware of treatment assignment.\n\nAll participants undergo baseline assessments within 6 weeks before surgery and repeat assessments at 9 ± 1 months postoperatively. Baseline and follow‑up measures include dual energy X‑ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans of the total body, total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine to determine areal BMD and body composition (fat mass, lean mass, appendicular lean mass). Participants are classified as osteopenic or osteoporotic according to WHO criteria. Quantitative CT (QCT) scans of the lumbar spine (L1–L5) are performed at both time points using a standardized protocol with a calibration phantom to assess volumetric BMD, and subject‑specific finite element models of the L2 vertebra are generated to estimate vertebral strength and fracture risk.\n\nFunctional and patient‑reported outcome measures include the Human Activity Profile, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and a calcium intake survey from the National Osteoporosis Foundation. Objective physical function tests comprise the 5 Times Sit to Stand test (lower extremity strength and function), handgrip strength (upper extremity strength), and the 4‑meter walk test (functional mobility and gait). Blood samples are collected at baseline and 9 months for bone turnover markers, including serum procollagen type 1 N‑terminal propeptide (P1NP, a formation marker) and urinary N‑telopeptide of type 1 collagen (NTX, a resorption marker), which are analyzed in batch using ELISA.\n\nTo minimize risk of hypocalcemia associated with zoledronic acid, all participants receive standardized supplementation beginning before surgery: 1200 mg of calcium daily and vitamin D dosed according to baseline 25‑hydroxyvitamin D levels (1000 IU daily if ≥30 ng/mL, 2000 IU daily if 20–29 ng/mL). ProCare bariatric multivitamins are supplied, and supplementation is continued throughout the study. Kidney function is assessed immediately prior to infusion via a comprehensive metabolic panel; participants must have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥35 mL/min to receive the infusion. Those with lower eGFR are not infused and may be withdrawn per endocrinologist review. Participants are monitored during and after infusion for acute adverse events, with vital signs recorded and side effect questionnaires administered immediately after, and again by telephone at 24 hours and 2 months post‑infusion.\n\nThe primary outcome is the change in total hip areal BMD (g/cm²) over 9 months following SG. Secondary outcomes include changes in femoral neck and lumbar spine (L1–L4) aBMD by DXA, lumbar spine volumetric BMD by QCT, vertebral strength from finite element analysis, bone turnover markers (P1NP and NTX), body composition, physical function measures, and patient‑reported outcomes. Feasibility is evaluated by tracking adverse events, side effects, and compliance with visits and supplementation.\n\nStatistical analyses are planned primarily for hypothesis generation and feasibility rather than confirmatory inference. A sample size of 10 participants per group yields 80% power to detect a between‑group difference of 0.11 g/cm² in total hip BMD using a two‑sided Wilcoxon test, assuming an SD of 0.07 g/cm². Similarly, within‑group changes of 0.07 g/cm² can be detected with adequate power. To account for an anticipated 33% attrition, 15 participants per group (30 total) will be recruited. Baseline characteristics will be summarized and compared between groups. The primary analysis uses a linear mixed model with total hip aBMD at 9 months as the outcome, including treatment group, sex, and menopausal status as independent variables, and contrasts to compare changes over 9 months at an alpha level of 0.05. No adjustments for multiple comparisons are planned.\n\nThe study is approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Nebraska Medical Center and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04279392). It is designed to generate preliminary data on the efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid in preventing SG‑associated bone loss and to assess the feasibility of a larger, definitive trial in this bariatric surgery population."
