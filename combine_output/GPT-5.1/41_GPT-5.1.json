      "briefSummary": "This phase 2b/3 HERALD trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of CVnCoV, a chemically unmodified mRNA vaccine encoding the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, for the prevention of COVID-19. In a randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled design at 47 centres in ten European and Latin American countries, adults aged 18 years or older with no prior virologically confirmed COVID-19 were assigned 1:1 to receive two doses of CVnCoV (12 μg mRNA) or placebo 28 days apart. The main aim was to determine whether CVnCoV prevents symptomatic, virologically confirmed COVID-19 of any severity starting 15 days after the second dose and to characterise its safety profile. The study found that CVnCoV provided moderate protection against symptomatic COVID-19, with higher efficacy against moderate-to-severe disease, in a setting dominated by SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and interest, and that it had an acceptable reactogenicity and safety profile.",
      "detailedDescription": "HERALD is an ongoing, multicentre, randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 2b/3 clinical trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of the CVnCoV SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine candidate in adults. The trial is conducted at 47 public and private hospitals and clinics across ten countries in Europe (Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain) and Latin America (Argentina, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Panama, Peru).\n\nCVnCoV is a chemically unmodified, lipid nanoparticle–formulated mRNA vaccine based on the RNActive platform. It encodes the stabilised, full-length spike protein of the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strain. Preclinical studies showed robust immunogenicity and protection in animal challenge models, and a preceding phase 1 dose-escalation study identified the 12 μg dose (given twice, 28 days apart) as safe and immunogenic, with antibody responses comparable to convalescent COVID-19 sera.\n\nIn HERALD, adults aged 18 years or older without a history of virologically confirmed COVID-19 were eligible, provided they had not recently received or planned to receive other investigational or non-registered vaccines, certain licensed vaccines within specified windows, or other SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), stratified by country and age group (18–60 years and ≥61 years), to receive two intramuscular injections of CVnCoV (0.6 mL containing 12 μg mRNA) or 0.9% NaCl placebo on days 1 and 29.\n\nThe trial has an initial phase 2b component focused on characterising safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity, and a phase 3 component focused on efficacy and longer-term safety. COVID-19 cases accrued in phase 2b are pooled with those from phase 3 for efficacy analyses. An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) oversees safety, with interim reviews prior to phase 3 initiation and after completion of vaccinations in phase 2b.\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint is the first episode of virologically confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19 of any severity (mild, moderate, or severe), caused by any SARS-CoV-2 strain, occurring from 15 days after the second dose up to one year. Symptomatic disease is identified through active surveillance: participants report potential COVID-19 symptoms, are contacted twice weekly via a mobile application, and, when indicated, undergo rapid antigen testing and central RT-PCR testing. All primary endpoint cases are confirmed by an independent adjudication committee. COVID-19 severity is categorised as mild, moderate, or severe using predefined clinical and physiological criteria, including symptoms, respiratory parameters, oxygen saturation, radiographic evidence, organ dysfunction, ICU admission, and death.\n\nKey secondary efficacy endpoints include the occurrence of first episodes of moderate-to-severe COVID-19, severe COVID-19, and subgroup analyses by age group (18–60 vs ≥61 years). An exploratory endpoint, added via protocol amendment, is efficacy against specific variants of concern or interest, supported by whole-genome sequencing of viral isolates from confirmed cases.\n\nSafety assessments include solicited local and systemic adverse events for 7 days and unsolicited adverse events for 28 days after each dose in phase 2b participants. Medically attended adverse events are collected up to 6 months after the second dose, and serious adverse events, adverse events of special interest, fatal events, and events leading to withdrawal are collected up to 1 year after the second dose in both phase 2b and phase 3 participants. Adverse events are graded by intensity and assessed for relatedness to study vaccination by investigators.\n\nThe trial is event-driven, with sample size and power calculations based on detecting a vaccine efficacy greater than 30% for symptomatic COVID-19 of any severity, assuming a true efficacy of 60% and using a two-sided alpha of 5% with an O'Brien-Fleming type alpha spending approach across interim analyses. The primary efficacy analysis set includes participants who received both doses as randomised, were SARS-CoV-2–naive at baseline and at day 43 (15 days post-second dose), and had not developed COVID-19 prior to day 43.\n\nInterim results up to June 18, 2021, show that among 39,680 randomised participants, 39,529 received at least one dose (19,783 CVnCoV; 19,746 placebo). The primary efficacy analysis included 12,851 CVnCoV and 12,211 placebo recipients, with a mean follow-up of approximately 48 days from 15 days after the second dose. A total of 228 adjudicated cases of symptomatic COVID-19 of any severity occurred (83 in CVnCoV, 145 in placebo), yielding an overall vaccine efficacy of 48.2% (95.826% CI 31.0–61.4) against symptomatic disease, meeting the prespecified success criterion (lower bound >30%). Vaccine efficacy against moderate-to-severe COVID-19 was 70.7% (95% CI 42.5–86.1). In participants aged 18–60 years, efficacy against symptomatic disease was 52.5% (95% CI 36.2–64.8) and against moderate-to-severe disease 77.2% (95% CI 51.8–90.4). There were too few cases in participants aged ≥61 years to derive robust efficacy estimates.\n\nSequencing data indicate that the trial was conducted in a setting dominated by SARS-CoV-2 variants: only about 3% of sequenced cases were wild-type B.1 lineage. Roughly half of cases were caused by variants of concern (including alpha/B.1.1.7 and gamma/P.1) and about one third by variants of interest (including lambda/C.37 and mu/B.1.621). Efficacy estimates against alpha, gamma, and lambda variants in adults 18–60 years were similar to the overall efficacy in that age group.\n\nReactogenicity was higher in the CVnCoV group than in the placebo group. In phase 2b, 96.5% of CVnCoV recipients versus 67.9% of placebo recipients reported at least one solicited local or systemic adverse event; 27.1% versus 3.1% reported grade 3 solicited events. The most common local reaction was injection-site pain; the most frequent systemic reactions were fatigue and headache. These events were generally transient, with a median duration of about 1–2 days, and did not increase in frequency or severity after the second dose. Unsolicited adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse events of special interest were infrequent and similar in overall frequency between groups, although a small number of serious and special-interest events were deemed related to vaccination. No fatal serious adverse events were considered related to study vaccination.\n\nThe investigators conclude that CVnCoV provides moderate protection against symptomatic COVID-19 and substantial protection against moderate-to-severe disease, with an acceptable safety profile, in a challenging environment with widespread circulation of SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, considering the evolving pandemic, emergence of new variants, and development timelines, the sponsor has decided to discontinue further development of CVnCoV and prioritise next-generation mRNA vaccine candidates."
