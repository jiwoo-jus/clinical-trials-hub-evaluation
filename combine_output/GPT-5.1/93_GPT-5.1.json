      "briefSummary": "This modeling study used clinical and imaging data from 16 patients with recurrent high‑grade glioma enrolled on the phase I trial NCT02313272 to explore whether an alternative radiotherapy schedule could improve tumor control. In the original trial, patients received hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HFSRT; 6 Gy × 5 daily fractions) together with the drugs bevacizumab and pembrolizumab. The investigators built a simple mathematical model of tumor growth, response to radiation, and development of resistance to bevacizumab and pembrolizumab, and then simulated an alternative strategy called intermittent radiotherapy (iRT), where single high-dose radiation fractions (≥6 Gy) are given every 6 weeks, with an optional 3‑fraction boost at progression. They compared the time to tumor regrowth under HFSRT versus iRT and iRT plus boost. Simulations suggested that iRT plus boost was equal or superior to standard HFSRT in most modeled patients and could extend time to progression, especially in patients whose tumors remain sensitive to bevacizumab and pembrolizumab, supporting prospective clinical evaluation of iRT in recurrent high‑grade glioma.",
      "detailedDescription": "This work is a hypothesis-generating mathematical modeling study based on patients with recurrent high‑grade glioma (rHGG), including glioblastoma, who were treated on the phase I trial NCT02313272 at Moffitt Cancer Center. In that trial, 32 patients received a combination of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HFSRT; 6 Gy × 5 fractions over one week), the VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab, and the anti–PD‑1 antibody pembrolizumab. MRI‑based tumor volumes were measured approximately every 6 weeks and responses were assessed using RANO criteria. For the present analysis, the authors focused on 16 patients who had quantifiable tumor progression and sufficient longitudinal volumetric data (median of six post‑treatment data points).\n\nThe clinical problem is that patients with rHGG have a median overall survival under one year and no established standard of care. Localized treatments such as surgery and radiotherapy cannot eradicate diffuse, infiltrative disease, and systemic therapies (including bevacizumab and immune checkpoint inhibitors) commonly lead to eventual resistance. The original HFSRT schedule aims for maximal log cell kill in a short time but may promote competitive release of resistant subclones, limit opportunities for re‑irradiation, and provide only a single major immune stimulus when combined with PD‑1 blockade.\n\nTo explore alternative approaches, the investigators extended a previously published tumor growth inhibition model (Glazar et al.) to incorporate the effects of HFSRT. Tumor growth was modeled as exponential with a global growth rate (λ) across patients. The model includes: (1) a viable tumor compartment that grows at rate λ and shrinks with an effective kill rate γ(t) representing drug-induced volume reduction by bevacizumab and pembrolizumab; (2) an exponentially decaying effectiveness of the drug combination governed by a resistance evolution parameter ε, so that γ(t) decreases over time; and (3) a radiation component where, at each radiotherapy fraction, a fixed patient‑specific surviving fraction S of viable tumor remains, and the remainder is transferred to a dying compartment. The dying compartment decays at the same rate λ (mitotic catastrophe). The total observable tumor volume is the sum of the viable and dying compartments. To prevent overfitting given sparse data, λ was treated as a global parameter and γ0 was set equal to λ, leaving three main patient‑specific parameters: initial tumor volume V0, evolution of resistance rate ε, and radiation surviving fraction S.\n\nParameter fitting was performed in MATLAB using constrained optimization (fmincon) to minimize the discrepancy between measured and simulated volumes. A grid search over plausible doubling times (5–40 days) identified an optimal global growth rate λ ≈ 0.065 day⁻¹ (doubling time ≈11 days). The model fit the volumetric MRI data with reasonable accuracy (median RMSE ≈1.9 cm³; R² ≈0.83 on log-transformed volumes). Bootstrapping was used to assess parameter uncertainty, assuming up to 20% contouring variability.\n\nAfter model calibration to the actual HFSRT + bevacizumab + pembrolizumab data, the authors simulated alternative fractionation schedules while keeping patient‑specific parameters (ε, S, V0) fixed across schedules:\n\n1. Standard HFSRT: 6 Gy × 5 daily fractions (as in the trial), with concurrent bevacizumab and pembrolizumab.\n2. Intermittent radiotherapy (iRT): 5 fractions of ≥6 Gy each, delivered as single fractions every 6 weeks, with the same per‑fraction dose distribution (gEUD and D98% as in the original plans) and concurrent drugs.\n3. iRT plus boost: iRT as above, with an additional 3 daily fractions (boost) delivered at the time of modeled progression.\n\nProgression in the simulations was defined for iRT as tumor volume at 6‑weekly assessments exceeding the minimum post‑treatment volume by more than 20%, recognizing that RANO/RECIST criteria are not optimized for intermittent, tumor‑management strategies. To compare overall efficacy across schedules, time to progression was quantified as the time to reach the last clinically recorded tumor volume (considered a proxy for maximum tolerated tumor burden) or, for patients who discontinued for non‑progression reasons, time to a 20% increase over initial volume. Kaplan–Meier curves and log‑rank tests were used to compare schedules.\n\nIn the 5‑fraction comparison, population‑level Kaplan–Meier analyses showed no statistically significant difference between HFSRT, iRT, and iRT + boost, mainly due to small sample size. At the patient level, iRT alone was non‑inferior (equal or longer time to progression) to HFSRT in 11 of 16 cases. The 5 non‑responders to iRT were characterized by significantly higher ε, meaning faster loss of efficacy of bevacizumab and pembrolizumab. Adding a 3‑fraction boost at progression improved outcomes in 4 of these 5 patients, so that iRT + boost was non‑inferior to HFSRT in 15 of 16 patients. The remaining patient with inferior iRT + boost outcome had the highest estimated resistance evolution rate ε.\n\nThe authors then explored the theoretical benefit of allowing more than five iRT fractions, under the rationale that intermittent delivery may enable normal tissue repair and allow safe dose escalation in selected patients. They simulated up to 13 high‑dose fractions at 6‑week intervals, with the option of a boost. As the number of possible fractions increased, the simulated time to progression increased for many patients, and separation between the HFSRT and iRT + boost Kaplan–Meier curves grew. Statistically significant superiority of iRT + boost over HFSRT emerged only when up to 13 fractions were allowed (p≈0.045), and only a subset of patients (5 of 16) derived substantial benefit from more than 11 fractions, highlighting interpatient heterogeneity.\n\nBased on comparative simulations, four qualitative response groups were identified: (1) patients for whom standard HFSRT was best; (2) those for whom iRT was initially inferior but iRT + boost restored or improved outcomes; (3) those for whom iRT + boost clearly prolonged time to progression beyond either HFSRT or iRT alone; and (4) those for whom iRT (even without boost) was superior. Across these groups, the key discriminating factor was the resistance evolution rate ε for bevacizumab and pembrolizumab; tumors with lower ε (slower resistance development) were more likely to benefit from intermittent radiotherapy strategies. Radiosensitivity S did not significantly differ between groups and did not correlate with prescribed dose measures (gEUD, D98%), suggesting biological heterogeneity beyond simple dosimetric effects.\n\nThe authors discuss several hypothetical advantages of an intermittent radiotherapy strategy in rHGG: (i) potential for dose escalation with reduced normal tissue toxicity due to greater inter-fraction repair time; (ii) adaptive personalization, including adjusting fraction number, dose, and target volume based on serial imaging; (iii) repeated immune stimulation and antigen resampling that may synergize with immune checkpoint blockade; (iv) evolutionary management by maintaining a population of treatment‑sensitive cells to compete with resistant clones; and (v) alignment with the palliative goal of tumor burden control rather than attempted eradication in a setting with no curative options.\n\nThey also acknowledge important limitations. The model is intentionally simple, omitting explicit radiation‑induced immune effects and detailed pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of bevacizumab and pembrolizumab. It assumes a shared exponential growth rate across patients and uses exponential growth even at larger tumor volumes, which may overestimate growth in some scenarios. Parameter identifiability is limited by small sample size and sparse data, and the simulations cannot predict toxicity or quality‑of‑life outcomes. Moreover, the work is purely theoretical; iRT has not yet been tested prospectively in this population.\n\nIn conclusion, under a conservative, worst‑case modeling framework, intermittent high‑dose radiotherapy with an optional 3‑fraction boost appears numerically non‑inferior to standard 5‑fraction HFSRT in most modeled rHGG patients treated with bevacizumab and pembrolizumab, and may meaningfully delay time to progression in selected individuals. These findings support further prospective clinical investigation of personalized intermittent radiotherapy schedules in recurrent high‑grade glioma."
