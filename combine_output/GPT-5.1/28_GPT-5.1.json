      "briefSummary": "This phase 2, open-label, randomized multicenter clinical trial evaluated whether adding andecaliximab (ADX), a monoclonal antibody inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), to the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab (NIVO) could improve outcomes for adults with previously treated, unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. Patients were randomized to receive ADX plus NIVO or NIVO alone. The main goal was to compare tumor shrinkage rates between the two groups, with additional assessment of survival, disease progression, safety, and multiple tissue and blood biomarkers (including PD-L1, TMB, HER2, TGF-β signatures, and others) that might predict benefit from immunotherapy.",
      "detailedDescription": "This was a phase 2, open-label, randomized, multicenter study (NCT02864381; GS-US-296-2013) conducted at 34 sites in the USA, Europe, and Australia. The study population consisted of adults (≥18 years) with histologically confirmed, inoperable locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who had experienced disease progression after at least one prior systemic therapy/line of treatment for unresectable or metastatic disease. Key eligibility criteria included measurable disease by RECIST v1.1, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0–1, adequate organ function, availability of archival tumor tissue for biomarker analyses, and tumor sites accessible for repeat biopsies.\n\nPatients were randomized 1:1 via a centralized, interactive web response system to receive either nivolumab (NIVO) monotherapy or the combination of andecaliximab (ADX) plus nivolumab. Randomization was stratified by tumor PD-L1 status, defined as tumor cell (TC) membrane PD-L1 expression ≥1% versus <1% by a central laboratory assay (28-8 pharmDx). In the NIVO-alone arm, patients received nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously over approximately 60 minutes on day 1 and every 2 weeks thereafter. In the combination arm, patients received ADX 800 mg intravenously over approximately 30 minutes on day 1 and every 2 weeks, followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously over approximately 60 minutes on the same schedule. Treatment continued for up to 2 years or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.\n\nThe primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) by investigator assessment using RECIST v1.1, defined as the proportion of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) prior to initiation of any new anticancer therapy. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response, and the incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and laboratory abnormalities. Imaging (contrast-enhanced CT or MRI) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed at baseline and every 8 weeks to assess tumor burden. Safety follow-up was conducted 30 days after the last dose of ADX and 5 months after the last dose of NIVO, with survival follow-up approximately every 3 months for up to 5 years.\n\nExtensive exploratory biomarker analyses were incorporated to understand predictors of response and resistance to immunotherapy and the biological impact of MMP9 inhibition. Archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue was used for central PD-L1 testing and additional biomarkers. On-treatment tumor biopsies were obtained between weeks 5 and 9. Biomarkers included PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and tumor-associated immune cells (TC and TC+IC), mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) by IHC (MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, PMS2), intratumoral CD8+ T-cell density by IHC and quantitative image analysis, desmoplasia scoring by pathology, whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing to derive gene signatures (including interferon-γ [IFN-γ], effector T cells [Teff], activated T cells, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition [EMT], TGF-β fibrosis signatures, angiogenesis, hypoxia, and others), and tumor mutation burden (TMB) derived from whole-exome sequencing in a subset of patients. Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were used to evaluate pathway-level associations with survival and treatment outcomes.\n\nStatistical planning assumed an ORR of 12% for nivolumab monotherapy and sought to detect a 20% absolute improvement with the ADX+NIVO combination, with approximately 83% power at a one-sided 10% significance level using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method. ORR was tested at a two-sided alpha of 0.2, with Clopper-Pearson 95% confidence intervals. ORs for treatment effect were estimated using stratified CMH tests by PD-L1 status. OS and PFS were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age and sex. PFS was defined from randomization to death from any cause or first definitive progression, and OS from randomization to death from any cause. Given the exploratory nature, p values were not adjusted for multiple comparisons.\n\nIn total, 144 patients were randomized (intent-to-treat population), and 141 received at least one dose of study drug (safety population). The median age was approximately 61–62 years; 81% of patients were white, and 69% were male. Patients had a median of 2 prior lines of therapy. Approximately 18% were PD-L1-positive based on tumor cell staining (TC ≥1%), and 72% were positive when tumors and associated immune cells were combined (TC+IC). Only three patients had dMMR tumors, all in the nivolumab-alone arm.\n\nEfficacy results showed that adding ADX to NIVO did not improve outcomes. The ORR was 10% (95% CI 4–19) with ADX+NIVO and 7% (95% CI 2–16) with NIVO alone (odds ratio 1.5; 95% CI 0.4–6.1; p=0.8). Disease control rate (CR+PR+stable disease) was 30.6% with ADX+NIVO and 23.6% with NIVO alone. Median OS was 7.1 months (95% CI 4.8 to not reached) with ADX+NIVO and 5.9 months (95% CI 3.5–10.9) with NIVO alone (HR 1.24; 95% CI 0.49–1.26; p=0.23). Median PFS was similarly not improved with the combination (HR 1.33; 95% CI 0.94–1.88; p=0.10). No patient subgroup derived clear benefit from adding ADX to NIVO.\n\nSafety profiles were comparable between treatment arms. The most common adverse events included fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, and vomiting. Grade ≥3 AEs occurred in about two-thirds of patients, most often anemia and abdominal pain. Serious AEs occurred in 59% (ADX+NIVO) and 54% (NIVO alone), with similar patterns across groups, supporting an acceptable safety profile for the combination but no efficacy advantage.\n\nPaired biopsies (baseline and on-treatment) demonstrated that nivolumab treatment alone increased intratumoral CD8+ T-cell density and T cell–related gene signatures, confirming immune activation by PD-1 blockade in gastric cancer. The addition of ADX led to a numerically larger increase in CD8+ T-cell infiltrates, particularly in PD-L1 (TC+IC)-positive tumors, but this did not translate into higher T cell inflammatory gene signatures or better clinical outcomes. Thus, while there was some evidence of pharmacodynamic activity on CD8+ T cells, MMP9 inhibition did not enhance the antitumor efficacy of nivolumab.\n\nGiven the absence of a combination benefit, data from both treatment arms were pooled to explore biomarkers of response to PD-1–based immunotherapy. PD-L1 positivity was associated with higher response rates and numerically longer OS, although not statistically significant for OS or PFS in multivariable models. Exploratory analyses identified several key associations: (1) gene signatures reflecting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and high TGF-β fibrosis scores were correlated with poorer survival; desmoplastic tumors exhibited higher EMT and TGF-β fibrosis signatures; (2) HER2 (ERBB2) positivity and high expression of genes in the ERBB2 amplicon (e.g., GRB7, PGAP3, MIEN1) were associated with significantly longer survival; most HER2-positive patients had prior trastuzumab exposure, but benefit from PD-1 blockade did not clearly depend on prior trastuzumab response; (3) higher tumor mutation burden (TMB) (at or above the median of 2.01 mutations/Mb) was associated with significantly longer OS and PFS, even in this relatively low-TMB gastric/GEJ population; and (4) in a multivariable model incorporating TMB, TGF-β fibrosis signature, and HER2 status, TMB emerged as the main driver of improved survival.\n\nIn conclusion, this randomized phase 2 study found that andecaliximab, a selective MMP9 inhibitor, added to nivolumab did not improve response, progression-free survival, or overall survival versus nivolumab alone in previously treated metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma, despite a manageable safety profile. Exploratory biomarker analyses suggest that HER2 positivity, higher TMB, and higher GRB7/ERBB2 expression are associated with improved outcomes on PD-1–based therapy, whereas high TGF-β fibrosis signatures and EMT-related pathways are linked to inferior survival. These findings support further evaluation of immune checkpoint inhibitors, particularly in HER2-positive and/or higher TMB gastric/GEJ cancers, and highlight TGF-β–mediated fibrosis and EMT as potential mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy."
