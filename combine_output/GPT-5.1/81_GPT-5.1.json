      "briefSummary": "This study is a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial that examined the effects of myo-inositol on the development of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in extremely preterm infants born before 28 weeks of gestation. The analysis focused on whether children who developed milder ROP (stage ≤3) that regressed without requiring ophthalmologic intervention had worse neurodevelopmental outcomes or more eye problems at 22–26 months corrected age compared with children who never developed ROP, and how both groups compared with children who had ROP requiring intervention. Neurodevelopment was assessed with Bayley-III composite scores (motor, cognitive, language) and behavioral measures, while eye outcomes included strabismus, nystagmus, tracking ability, and visual acuity. The study found that children with ROP stage ≤3 without intervention had similar motor, cognitive, language, neurological, and behavioral outcomes to those without ROP, but had a higher rate of strabismus. Children who required ophthalmologic treatment for ROP had poorer neurodevelopmental scores, more motor impairment and hearing loss, and worse visual acuity than children with untreated milder ROP.",
      "detailedDescription": "This investigation is a secondary analysis of the \"Inositol to Reduce Retinopathy of Prematurity\" randomized controlled trial (NCT01954082), which enrolled infants born extremely preterm (<28 weeks’ gestation) at 18 centers in the NICHD Neonatal Research Network between April 2014 and September 2015. The original trial evaluated whether myo-inositol affected the incidence or severity of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). For this secondary analysis, infants who survived to final ROP status and completed follow-up at 22–26 months’ corrected age were included.\n\nParticipants were classified into three groups based on their ROP history: (1) no ROP, (2) ROP stage ≤3 without ophthalmologic intervention, and (3) ROP with ophthalmologic intervention (retinal ablation, scleral buckling, vitrectomy, or anti-VEGF therapy). The primary objective was to determine whether children with lower stage ROP that regressed without intervention had worse neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years’ corrected age than children without ROP. A secondary objective was to compare these two groups with children who required intervention for ROP.\n\nNeurodevelopment was assessed at 22–26 months’ corrected age using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd Edition (Bayley-III), providing composite motor, cognitive, and language scores (mean 100, SD 15). Children who were untestable because of severe delay were assigned standardized low scores. Behavioral outcomes were evaluated using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), yielding standardized T-scores across syndrome scales, internalizing, externalizing, total problems, and DSM-oriented scales. Neurologic outcomes included results of a detailed neurologic examination, diagnosis of cerebral palsy, and gross motor function classification system (GMFCS) levels. Medical history of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was also recorded.\n\nOphthalmologic outcomes at 22–26 months’ corrected age were documented as part of the neurologic visit and included strabismus, nystagmus, roving eye movements, ability to track 180 degrees, history of eye surgery for non-ROP indications, prescription of corrective lenses, and visual acuity (derived from parent report or medical record). Visual acuity categories distinguished normal vision, vision abnormalities, blindness with some functional vision, and blindness with no functional vision.\n\nBaseline maternal and neonatal characteristics and early neonatal morbidities (e.g., patent ductus arteriosus, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, spontaneous intestinal perforation, intracranial hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, late-onset sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis) were compared between ROP groups. Intracranial hemorrhage was classified using Papile criteria. Small for gestational age status was defined as birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age.\n\nPrimary outcomes (Bayley-III composite scores) were analyzed using generalized linear models with ROP group as the main exposure, adjusting for gestational age, sex, maternal race, and severe intraventricular hemorrhage (grades III–IV), with study center as a random effect. A Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple primary comparisons. Secondary outcomes (neurologic, behavioral, ophthalmologic measures, ASD, GMFCS categories) were analyzed using generalized linear or modified Poisson models with similar covariate adjustment, but without multiplicity correction due to their exploratory nature. A sensitivity analysis adjusting for myo-inositol randomization group did not change the findings.\n\nAmong 506 children evaluated at 22–26 months’ corrected age, 173 (34%) had no ROP, 262 (52%) had ROP stage ≤3 without ophthalmologic intervention, and 71 (14%) had ROP with intervention. Children with ROP stage ≤3 without intervention did not differ from children without ROP in adjusted mean Bayley-III motor, cognitive, or language scores. The incidences of abnormal neurologic examination, cerebral palsy, GMFCS ≥2, and history or suspicion of ASD were also similar between these two groups. CBCL T-scores were largely comparable; although some domains (aggressive behavior, attention deficit/hyperactivity problems, externalizing problems) showed statistically lower (more favorable) scores in the ROP-without-intervention group, differences were small (<2 points) and most children in both groups scored in the normal range.\n\nIn terms of ophthalmologic outcomes, children with ROP stage ≤3 without intervention were more likely to have strabismus than those without ROP (adjusted relative risk ~2.1). There were no significant differences between these two groups in nystagmus, roving eye movements, ability to track 180 degrees, eye surgery for non-ROP indications, or prescription of corrective lenses. A small number of children with ROP stage ≤3 without intervention were blind with some functional vision, but numbers were too low for robust between-group comparisons.\n\nIn contrast, children who had ROP with ophthalmologic intervention demonstrated significantly lower mean Bayley-III motor, cognitive, and language scores compared with children who had ROP stage ≤3 without intervention. They were more likely to have GMFCS level ≥2 and hearing loss, although the overall incidence of cerebral palsy and abnormal neurologic examination did not differ significantly. CBCL behavioral profiles were similar between the intervention and non-intervention ROP groups, with most scores in the normal range. Children with treated ROP had markedly worse visual acuity, with fewer having normal vision and more having significant vision impairment or blindness. The incidence of nystagmus was higher and approached statistical significance in the intervention group, whereas other ophthalmologic measures did not differ clearly after adjustment.\n\nThe authors interpret these findings as evidence that, among extremely preterm infants, milder ROP (stage ≤3) that regresses without intervention is not associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years’ corrected age relative to no ROP, although it is associated with a higher incidence of strabismus and occasional blindness with functional vision. By contrast, ROP severe enough to require ophthalmologic treatment is linked to poorer neurodevelopmental performance, more motor impairment and hearing loss, and substantially worse visual outcomes. These results support tailoring anticipatory counseling for families of extremely preterm infants based on ROP severity, emphasizing that untreated mild ROP does not appear to worsen early neurodevelopment but still warrants ophthalmologic follow-up, while treated ROP is a marker for increased risk of both neurodevelopmental and visual impairment. The authors note limitations including reliance on reported visual acuity rather than standardized testing, potential referral and reporting biases, lack of postnatal growth data, and relatively early age of follow-up, which may not capture later-emerging difficulties in executive function and academic skills."
