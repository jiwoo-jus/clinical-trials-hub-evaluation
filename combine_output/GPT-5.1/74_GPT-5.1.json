      "briefSummary": "This multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial evaluated the safety and effectiveness of an advanced hybrid closed-loop (AHCL) insulin delivery system (MiniMed AHCL/MiniMed 780G algorithm) in adolescents and adults with type 1 diabetes. After a run‑in period using the system as a sensor-augmented pump with or without predictive low glucose management or automated basal delivery, participants used automated basal and automated correction bolus functions for about 3 months with glucose targets of 100 mg/dL and 120 mg/dL. The study assessed safety events, changes in hemoglobin A1C, time in range (70–180 mg/dL), time below range (<70 mg/dL), and other continuous glucose monitoring metrics, and explored how different glucose targets and active insulin time settings affect glycemic outcomes.",
      "detailedDescription": "This pivotal trial was designed to assess the safety and glycemic impact of an advanced hybrid closed-loop (AHCL) insulin delivery system in adolescents (14–21 years) and adults (22–75 years) with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The AHCL system consists of a MiniMed 670G insulin pump running a next-generation version 4.0 algorithm (MiniMed 780G-type) integrated with the Guardian Sensor 3 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system and Guardian Link 3 transmitter. The algorithm provides automated basal insulin delivery (Auto Basal), automated correction boluses (Auto Correction) up to every 5 minutes, predictive low glucose management features, and a meal detection module that can intensify correction boluses when a meal is suspected. Users can choose a glucose target of 100 mg/dL or 120 mg/dL and may temporarily set a target of 150 mg/dL.\n\nThe study employed a multicenter, open-label, single-arm design. Eligible participants had type 1 diabetes for at least 2 years, used insulin pump therapy for more than 6 months, required at least 8 units of insulin per day, and had screening hemoglobin A1C <10%. Exclusion criteria included recent severe hypoglycemia requiring assistance, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), recent hospitalization for uncontrolled diabetes, hypoglycemia unawareness, and significant skin issues preventing sensor use.\n\nParticipants completed a baseline run-in period of approximately 14 days using the AHCL hardware as a sensor-augmented pump (SAP) with or without predictive low glucose management (PLGM) or with Auto Basal only; automated correction bolus (Auto Correction) was generally disabled during this phase. This run-in served as the comparator for subsequent closed-loop outcomes. Following run-in, participants entered a study phase of approximately 90 days in which both Auto Basal and Auto Correction were enabled. Each participant used one programmed glucose target (100 or 120 mg/dL) for about 45 ± 5 days, then switched to the alternate target for the remaining 45 ± 5 days, allowing within-subject comparison of different target settings. Active insulin time (AIT) settings were clinician- and user-selected and examined post hoc for their association with glycemic outcomes.\n\nThe intent-to-treat cohort included 157 participants (39 adolescents and 118 adults); 152 completed the full study phase. The primary efficacy endpoints were exploratory and included change in mean time in range (TIR, 70–180 mg/dL) and mean hemoglobin A1C from the end of run-in to the end of the study phase. Additional glycemic endpoints included mean sensor glucose (SG), coefficient of variation (CV) of SG, time below range (TBR) at thresholds <70, <54, and <50 mg/dL, time above range (TAR) at thresholds >180, >250, and >300 mg/dL, and day (6 AM–12 AM) vs night (12 AM–6 AM) metrics. Insulin delivery endpoints included total daily insulin dose, basal (including microboluses), user-initiated boluses, and automated correction boluses in absolute units and as a proportion of total bolus insulin. Safety endpoints included serious adverse events (SAEs), serious adverse device effects (SADEs), unanticipated adverse device effects, severe hypoglycemia, and DKA.\n\nAnalyses were performed primarily in the intent-to-treat population, with a per-protocol sensitivity analysis yielding similar results. Within-participant comparisons between run-in and study phase used Wilcoxon signed-rank tests or paired t-tests, and associations between AIT and glycemic metrics used Spearman correlations.\n\nDuring the study phase, participants spent on average about 95% of time in closed-loop mode, with roughly 1.2 exits per week. Compared with run-in therapy (SAP/PLGM/Auto Basal without Auto Correction), use of full AHCL (Auto Basal + Auto Correction) reduced mean A1C from 7.5% to 7.0%, increased 24-hour TIR from 68.8% to 74.5%, and reduced TBR (<70 mg/dL) from 3.3% to 2.3%, without severe hypoglycemia or DKA. Improvements were observed in both adolescents and adults and were more pronounced overnight, where TIR exceeded 80% and both TBR and TAR decreased. The fraction of participants achieving an A1C <7% and TIR >70% increased substantially, and a larger proportion met international consensus CGM targets for TIR and limited hypoglycemia (TBR <70 mg/dL <4% and TBR <54 mg/dL <1%).\n\nSubgroup analyses showed that setting the glucose target to 100 mg/dL yielded higher TIR than 120 mg/dL, and more aggressive AIT settings (as short as 2 hours) at the 100 mg/dL target further improved TIR without a meaningful increase in TBR. Automated correction boluses accounted for about 20–22% of total bolus insulin over the full day and more than 60% of bolus insulin overnight, indicating that the algorithm assumed a substantial part of corrective dosing burden, especially during sleep. Total insulin and total bolus doses increased modestly from run-in to the study phase, particularly in adolescents, while basal insulin decreased somewhat in adults over the full day and daytime.\n\nAcross more than 20,000 device days in the entire study and more than 14,000 days with Auto Basal and Auto Correction enabled, the safety profile was favorable: no device-related SAEs, no SADEs or unanticipated device effects, and no DKA. One severe hypoglycemia event occurred during the run-in period (before full AHCL use) and was not attributed to the investigational device. The AHCL system performance and safety were consistent with, and extended, prior smaller randomized controlled trials and cross-over studies of this algorithm in camp, supervised, and at-home settings.\n\nOverall, the study demonstrates that the MiniMed AHCL system is safe and effective for improving glycemic control in adolescents and adults with type 1 diabetes who are already experienced pump users, enabling more users to attain international CGM-based targets for time in range and hypoglycemia. The findings suggest that appropriate selection of glucose target and active insulin time settings can further optimize glycemic outcomes and may reduce day-to-day management burden by shifting more corrective dosing to the automated system."
