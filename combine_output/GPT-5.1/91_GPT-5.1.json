      "briefSummary": "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (PAUSE) investigated whether the drug abatacept, which blocks CD28/B7 costimulatory signaling on T cells, could prevent relapse of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis after stopping ustekinumab, a biologic that targets the IL‑12/IL‑23 pathway. Adults with plaque psoriasis first received open‑label ustekinumab; those who responded well at week 12 were randomized either to continue ustekinumab or to switch to abatacept while ustekinumab was withdrawn. The main question was whether abatacept could maintain the clinical benefits and suppress the psoriasis‑related molecular signature in skin and blood, thereby preventing or delaying relapse. The study found that abatacept did not prevent psoriasis relapse and did not maintain suppression of the pathogenic IL‑23‑mediated psoriasis molecular pathways after ustekinumab withdrawal.",
      "detailedDescription": "The Psoriasis Treatment with Abatacept and Ustekinumab: a Study of Efficacy (PAUSE) trial was a multicenter, parallel‑design, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled randomized clinical trial conducted at 10 sites in the United States and Canada. The trial enrolled adults aged 18 to 65 years with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, defined by a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) of at least 12 and body surface area involvement of at least 10%. Key exclusion criteria included prior exposure to ustekinumab or other IL‑12/IL‑23‑targeting agents, moderate to severe psoriatic arthritis, and comorbidities that increased risk.\n\nThe study was designed to test the hypothesis that blocking T‑cell costimulatory signaling via CD28‑CD80/CD86 with abatacept (CTLA4‑Ig) would induce or maintain T‑cell tolerance in resolving psoriasis lesions after ustekinumab induction, thereby preventing or delaying psoriasis relapse. T‑cell activation requires both antigen‑specific T‑cell receptor engagement and costimulatory signals; in the absence of CD28‑mediated costimulation, T‑cell tolerance may result. Abatacept competes with CD28 for binding to CD80/CD86 on antigen‑presenting cells, inhibiting T‑cell activation. Earlier phase studies suggested clinical benefit of abatacept in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, motivating this sequential therapy approach.\n\nThe trial comprised three phases: (1) a lead‑in phase (weeks 0–12), (2) a randomized treatment phase (weeks 12–40), and (3) an observation phase (weeks 40–88). During the lead‑in phase, 108 participants received subcutaneous ustekinumab at weeks 0 and 4 (45 mg if body weight ≤100 kg, 90 mg if >100 kg). At week 12, response to ustekinumab was assessed; 91 participants (84.3%) who achieved at least 75% improvement from baseline PASI (PASI 75) were randomized 1:1 using a stratified, permuted‑block design (stratified by baseline PASI 12–20 vs >20).\n\nRandomized participants either continued ustekinumab (ustekinumab group) or were switched to abatacept (abatacept group). The abatacept group received subcutaneous abatacept 125 mg weekly from weeks 12 to 39 and ustekinumab placebo at weeks 16 and 28. The ustekinumab group received active ustekinumab at weeks 16 and 28 and abatacept placebo weekly from weeks 12 to 39. All systemic biologic, immunosuppressive, and topical psoriasis therapies outside protocol drugs were prohibited. Study drug administration ended at week 39; participants were then followed for relapse through week 88. PASI was measured every 4 weeks.\n\nThe primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with psoriasis relapse between weeks 12 and 88. Psoriasis relapse was defined as loss of at least 50% of the original PASI improvement observed at week 12 versus baseline. Secondary endpoints included time to relapse, proportion relapsing between weeks 12 and 40, and safety (treatment‑emergent and serious adverse events). The primary analysis was performed in the intention‑to‑treat (ITT) population (all randomized participants). Logistic regression with treatment group as the main factor and baseline PASI stratum plus disease duration as covariates was used for the primary comparison. Participants who discontinued early because of relapse or worsening psoriasis were classified as having relapsed. Other early discontinuations were classified as dropouts; the primary analysis treated all dropouts as relapsed, with sensitivity analyses treating dropouts as non‑relapsed or excluding them.\n\nThe trial also incorporated extensive mechanistic endpoints. Paired lesional and nonlesional skin biopsies were obtained at baseline (week 0) and from the same lesion at week 12 and subsequently at week 24 (optional), week 40, and at the final visit. RNA was extracted and analyzed via RNA sequencing to characterize the psoriasis disease transcriptome, focusing on an IL‑23– and IL‑17A‑mediated psoriasis molecular signature, including keratinocyte‑induced genes downstream of IL‑17 receptor signaling. Differentially expressed genes were defined by fold change ≥1.5 and false discovery rate <0.05. In addition, serum cytokines (including IL‑17A, IL‑22, IL‑19, interferon‑γ, IL‑2, IL‑10, IL‑6, tumor necrosis factor, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin) were quantified using an ultrasensitive multiplex immunoassay; serum IL‑19 was assayed separately.\n\nOf the 91 randomized participants, 45 were assigned to abatacept and 46 to continued ustekinumab. The primary endpoint was not met. Between weeks 12 and 88, psoriasis relapse occurred in 41 of 45 participants (91.1%) in the abatacept group and 40 of 46 (87.0%) in the ustekinumab group (P = .41). A larger proportion in the abatacept group relapsed between weeks 12 and 40 (55.6% vs 30.4%; P = .01). The median time to relapse from enrollment was shorter with abatacept (40 weeks; 95% CI, 40–52) than with continued ustekinumab (60 weeks; 95% CI, 56–68), but when measured from the last ustekinumab dose, time to relapse was similar between groups (36 vs 32 weeks). Longer time to relapse was associated with achieving PASI 90 or greater response, but not with baseline weight or PASI. Adverse event frequencies and rates, including serious events, were similar between groups.\n\nTranscriptomic analysis at baseline identified 3,988 differentially expressed genes in lesional versus nonlesional skin, defining the disease transcriptome. After 12 weeks of ustekinumab induction, 2,705 genes were significantly modulated in resolving lesions versus baseline lesions, 2,553 of which belonged to the disease transcriptome. Ustekinumab effectively downregulated IL‑23‑mediated genes, including IL‑17A and key psoriasis molecular signature genes expressed by keratinocytes, as well as transcripts related to the CD28‑CD80/CD86 pathway (CD80, CD28, ICOS, CTLA‑4). Serum levels of IL‑17A, IL‑22, and IL‑19 were significantly reduced at week 12, along with modest reductions in interferon‑γ, IL‑2, IL‑10, IL‑6, tumor necrosis factor, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin.\n\nIn participants who completed blinded treatment through week 39, continued ustekinumab maintained suppression of the psoriasis molecular signature in resolving lesions, whereas switching to abatacept did not. The weighted mean expression (eigengene) of the psoriasis molecular signature and IL‑17A transcripts increased in the abatacept group by weeks 24 and 40, correlating with the earlier clinical relapse. Similarly, suppression of serum IL‑19 achieved at week 12 was not maintained at week 40 in the abatacept group, in contrast to the ustekinumab group. Serum IL‑17A and IL‑22 levels were comparable between groups over time, differing from the patterns seen at the transcript level in skin.\n\nAdditional mechanistic analyses focused on cytokines associated with regulatory T cells (Tregs). Because the CD28 costimulatory pathway is important for Treg development and maintenance, and abatacept is known to reduce circulating effector Tregs and follicular helper T cells, investigators examined IL‑2 and IL‑10. In the PAUSE cohort, serum IL‑10 and IL‑2 levels were significantly reduced at weeks 24 and 40 in the abatacept group versus the ustekinumab group. This pattern was consistent with an independent placebo‑controlled abatacept trial in multiple sclerosis (ACCLAIM), supporting the conclusion that abatacept decreases serum cytokines associated with Tregs in both settings. IL‑10 and IL‑2 transcripts in lesional skin showed a downward trend with abatacept but did not differ significantly between treatment groups.\n\nOverall, the study demonstrated that sequential costimulatory blockade with abatacept after ustekinumab‑induced remission did not prevent psoriasis relapse and did not sustain suppression of the pathogenic IL‑23‑mediated psoriasis molecular signature in skin. The findings suggest that relapse in plaque psoriasis may be driven by mechanisms that are at least partly independent of CD28‑CD80/CD86 signaling, potentially involving tissue‑resident memory T cells capable of producing IL‑17A and IL‑22 via CD28‑independent pathways. These data imply that abatacept is not effective for maintaining cutaneous remission after ustekinumab withdrawal and may not be suitable as a strategy to concurrently control skin lesions in patients with psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis when ustekinumab is discontinued. Limitations include the chosen abatacept dose and timing relative to ustekinumab induction, constraints on the number and timing of skin and blood samples, and the absence of a double‑placebo arm to disentangle effects of abatacept from natural disease course after ustekinumab withdrawal."
