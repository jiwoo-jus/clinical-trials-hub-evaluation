      "briefSummary": "This ongoing phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial (FLAIR; NCT04492722) is testing AZD5718, an oral 5‑lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) inhibitor, in adults with proteinuric chronic kidney disease (CKD) with or without type 2 diabetes. All participants have reduced kidney function and increased albumin in their urine despite standard treatments such as ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers, and some are on SGLT2 inhibitors. Participants are randomized to three different doses of AZD5718 or placebo for 12 weeks on top of their usual care, followed by 8 weeks in which all participants also receive the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin. The main goal is to determine whether AZD5718, especially when combined with dapagliflozin, further reduces urinary albumin‑to‑creatinine ratio (UACR), a surrogate marker for risk of kidney failure. The study also evaluates effects on kidney function, blood pressure, safety, pharmacokinetics, leukotriene pathway biomarkers, and, in a substudy, diabetic retinopathy.",
      "detailedDescription": "FLAIR (FLAP Inhibition in Renal disease) is a phase 2b, randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, multicenter clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of the FLAP inhibitor AZD5718 in adults with proteinuric chronic kidney disease (CKD), with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Leukotrienes are proinflammatory and vasoconstrictive lipid mediators generated via the 5‑lipoxygenase/FLAP pathway and are implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases and CKD pathogenesis. AZD5718 is a potent, selective, reversible FLAP inhibitor that suppresses biosynthesis of leukotriene B4 and the cysteinyl leukotrienes (C4, D4, E4).\n\nEligible participants are ≥18 years of age, have albuminuric CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 20–75 mL/min/1.73 m² and urinary albumin‑to‑creatinine ratio [UACR] 200–5000 mg/g), and are on stable standard of care including ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers when tolerated. Patients may have diabetic or nondiabetic CKD; approximately two‑thirds will have type 2 diabetic kidney disease and one‑third nondiabetic CKD. Use of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP‑1 receptor agonists is allowed if doses are stable before randomization. Key exclusions include polycystic kidney disease or anatomical causes of CKD, type 1 diabetes, severe hepatic impairment, active or recent severe COVID‑19, certain immunomodulatory or interacting drugs, and pregnancy or breastfeeding.\n\nParticipants are randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive one of three AZD5718 doses or matching placebo once daily for 12 weeks, added to their existing therapy. Randomization is stratified by presence of type 2 diabetes, pre‑existing SGLT2 inhibitor use, and Japanese vs non‑Japanese participants. After 12 weeks, participants without complete resolution of albuminuria (<30 mg/g) enter an 8‑week extension in which all continue their assigned AZD5718 or placebo and additionally receive dapagliflozin 10 mg/day, representing anticipated future standard of care. Participants previously on other SGLT2 inhibitors switch to dapagliflozin for this period. The total on‑treatment duration is 20 weeks, followed by a 4‑week safety follow‑up.\n\nThe primary objective is to characterize the dose–response effect of AZD5718 plus dapagliflozin on UACR from baseline to week 20. The key secondary objective is to assess the dose–response effect of AZD5718 on UACR at week 12 when given on top of current standard of care (with limited or no mandated SGLT2 inhibitor use). Other secondary objectives include evaluation of safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics of AZD5718, effects on ambulatory blood pressure, and effects on kidney function (eGFR) with and without dapagliflozin. Exploratory objectives include assessing dose–response effects on urinary and plasma leukotriene E4 as a pharmacodynamic biomarker of 5‑lipoxygenase pathway inhibition; collecting plasma, serum, and urine for additional biomarkers of inflammation and fibrosis (e.g., high‑sensitivity C‑reactive protein, interleukin‑6, PRO‑C6) that may reflect or predict response; assessing a subset of participants with diabetic kidney disease for changes in diabetic retinopathy using visual acuity (ETDRS charts) and optical coherence tomography; and characterizing dapagliflozin pharmacokinetics after 8 weeks of co‑administration.\n\nEfficacy is primarily assessed by change in UACR. To reduce variability, participants collect first‑morning urine samples for three consecutive days before each study visit; the geometric mean of triplicate UACR values is used for analyses. Kidney function is assessed using the CKD‑EPI creatinine‑based eGFR equation, with cystatin C collected for exploratory analyses including combined creatinine/cystatin C‑based eGFR. Safety assessments include adverse event and serious adverse event monitoring, physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs, and routine laboratory tests. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is performed at baseline and week 12 to quantify 24‑hour mean systolic blood pressure and ensure absence of clinically relevant hypertensive effects.\n\nThe planned sample size is 632 participants (158 per group), which, allowing for approximately 10% discontinuation, provides 91% power to detect a 30% reduction in UACR between the highest AZD5718 dose and placebo at a two‑sided alpha of 0.1, and at least 80% power to detect a dose‑response in the diabetic kidney disease stratum. The trial is being conducted at approximately 120 sites in 11 countries, with at least 72 Japanese participants to meet local regulatory requirements. The study follows Good Clinical Practice, the Declaration of Helsinki, and relevant regulatory guidelines. Outcomes are intended to determine whether FLAP inhibition with AZD5718 can meaningfully reduce albuminuria and favorably affect kidney and cardiovascular risk markers in CKD, inform AZD5718 dose selection, define responder populations using biomarker data, and guide the design of future phase 3 trials using eGFR slope and other hard renal endpoints."
