      "briefSummary": "This single-center randomized controlled trial (ISOCRATe) investigated whether a slower rewarming rate after targeted temperature management (TTM) at 33 °C would reduce systemic inflammation in adults who remained comatose after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with a shockable rhythm. After achieving and maintaining hypothermia at 33 °C for 24 hours using a closed-loop cooling device, patients were randomly assigned to be rewarmed at either 0.25 °C per hour or 0.50 °C per hour, then maintained at 37 °C for 24 hours. The main measure was the level of the inflammatory marker interleukin-6 (IL-6) between 24 and 48 hours after reaching 33 °C. The study found no significant difference in IL-6 levels, neuroinjury biomarkers, or 90-day neurological outcomes between the two rewarming rates, suggesting that slower active rewarming from 33 °C did not improve inflammatory or functional outcomes in this population.",
      "detailedDescription": "The ISOCRATe (Impact of Speed Of rewarming after CaRdiac ArresT(e)) trial was an investigator-initiated, pilot, parallel-group, randomized controlled study conducted in a French medical-surgical intensive care unit. The trial addressed a specific component of targeted temperature management (TTM) after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA): the optimal rate of active rewarming from therapeutic hypothermia at 33 °C.\n\nAdult patients (≥18 years) who were unconscious (Glasgow Coma Scale ≤8) after OHCA with an initial shockable rhythm (ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia) and treated with TTM at 33 °C using a closed-loop cooling device (Artic Sun) were eligible. Exclusion criteria included prolonged no-flow (>10 min) or low-flow (>60 min) times, severe hemodynamic instability requiring high-dose vasopressors, delay >300 minutes from arrest to inclusion, moribund status, advanced liver disease (Child–Pugh C), current treatment with IL-6 receptor antagonists or high-dose corticosteroids, pregnancy, incarceration, previous enrollment in another cardiac arrest RCT with 90-day functional outcome as the primary endpoint, lack of statutory health insurance, or refusal by next of kin.\n\nTTM was protocolized: rapid induction of hypothermia to 33 °C, followed by 24 hours of maintenance at 33 °C, with esophageal temperature monitoring. Sedation was standardized using midazolam and sufentanil to achieve deep sedation (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale −5), and shivering was managed with a stepwise protocol including additional sedatives, opioids, and neuromuscular blockade (cisatracurium) as needed. Life-sustaining treatment withdrawal followed guideline-based multimodal neuroprognostication.\n\nRandomization occurred 18–24 hours after reaching 33 °C, at the end of the maintenance phase, to avoid including patients who died during induction or maintenance and therefore could not contribute IL-6 data. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio via a web-based system to one of two rewarming strategies: (1) slow rewarming at 0.25 °C/h to 37 °C, then maintenance at 37 °C for 24 hours; or (2) faster rewarming at 0.50 °C/h to 37 °C, then maintenance at 37 °C for 24 hours. Treating clinicians were not blinded due to the nature of the intervention, but the psychologist assessing 90-day outcomes was blinded to treatment allocation.\n\nThe primary endpoint was systemic inflammation assessed by serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels between 24 and 48 hours after reaching 33 °C. IL-6 was measured at achievement of 33 °C (H0) and at 12, 24, 36, 40, and 48 hours thereafter using a Luminex Magpix-based assay, but only post-randomization values (24–48 hours) were analyzed. The primary analysis used the area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) for IL-6 from 24 to 48 hours, calculated by the trapezoidal rule and compared between groups using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.\n\nSecondary outcomes included: (1) neurological functional outcome at day 90, measured by the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scale, with favorable outcome defined as CPC 1–2; (2) ICU mortality and hospital (day-90) mortality; (3) ICU length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation; and (4) additional biomarker profiles. Other inflammatory and injury biomarkers (IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor, TNF-α, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin) were assayed at the same time points as IL-6. Serum neurofilament light chain (NF-L) at 48 hours and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) at 48 and 72 hours after OHCA were measured as markers of neuronal injury. Some biomarker outcomes were dichotomized against the lower limit of detection, and others were analyzed as continuous variables.\n\nSample size was calculated for the IL-6 endpoint, assuming a 15% difference in mean IL-6 at 48 hours between groups, strong within-patient correlation of repeated IL-6 values, and a standard deviation based on prior data, with α=0.05 and β=0.10. This yielded 25 randomized patients per arm. Anticipating approximately 20% pre-randomization mortality, investigators planned to enroll 60 patients; ultimately, 58 were included and 50 randomized.\n\nAmong the 50 randomized patients (25 per group), baseline characteristics, cardiac arrest parameters (e.g., location, bystander CPR, initial rhythm, epinephrine dose, no-flow and low-flow durations), illness severity (SAPS II, CAHP score), and rates of coronary revascularization were generally similar between groups. Median time from randomization to rewarming initiation was about 4.5–5 hours, the time from rewarming onset to 37 °C was approximately 16.5 hours in the 0.25 °C/h group and 8.8 hours in the 0.50 °C/h group, confirming clear separation of exposure to the two rewarming rates.\n\nThe primary outcome analysis showed no significant difference in IL-6 exposure between groups: median IL-6 AUC (24–48 h) was 12,389 pg/mL·h (IQR 7,256–37,200) in the 0.25 °C/h group versus 8,859 pg/mL·h (IQR 6,825–18,088) in the 0.50 °C/h group (P=0.55). One patient who died between 32 and 40 hours post-H0 was excluded from this AUC analysis due to missing late IL-6 values. IL-6 time courses across all measured points likewise did not demonstrate a favorable pattern with slower rewarming.\n\nSecondary biomarker analyses did not reveal consistent differences between rewarming strategies. Aside from a difference in IL-2 at a single time point (H40), which may represent a chance finding in exploratory analyses without multiplicity adjustment, levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, GM-CSF, TNF-α, CRP, and procalcitonin did not differ significantly between groups. Median NF-L at 48 hours was 76.0 pg/mL (IQR 25.5–3,074.0) in the 0.25 °C/h arm versus 192 pg/mL (IQR 33.6–4,199.0) in the 0.50 °C/h arm (P=0.43). NSE levels at 48 and 72 hours were also similar between groups.\n\nClinical outcomes were likewise comparable. At 90 days, 13 of 25 patients (52.0%) in each group had a favorable CPC score (1 or 2), with identical point estimates and overlapping confidence intervals. ICU mortality and hospital mortality did not differ significantly; the hazard ratio for ICU death for 0.25 °C/h versus 0.50 °C/h was 1.43 (95% CI 0.62–3.32; P=0.41), and a similar estimate was found for in-hospital mortality. ICU and hospital lengths of stay and durations of mechanical ventilation showed no meaningful differences. Exploratory analyses of metabolic disturbances, arrhythmias, and cardiovascular SOFA score trajectories also did not demonstrate clear separation between the rewarming strategies.\n\nThe authors discuss that while TTM is widely used to mitigate postcardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS), the optimal rewarming parameters remain uncertain, and existing observational studies on rewarming rate have yielded conflicting results. IL-6 was chosen as a surrogate marker of systemic inflammation and PCAS severity because it rises early after cardiac arrest, is associated with worse outcomes in prior studies, and has a short half-life that permits detection of rapid changes. However, in this trial, modifying the rewarming rate within the commonly used range (0.25–0.50 °C/h) did not appear to alter IL-6 dynamics, neuronal injury biomarkers, or neurological outcomes at 90 days.\n\nThe authors note limitations, including the single-center design, the focus on OHCA with shockable rhythms (potentially limiting generalizability to non-shockable arrests), and the use of a surrogate primary endpoint rather than functional outcome. The trial was deliberately designed as a pilot to inform future, larger RCTs that might use blinded, long-term functional outcomes as primary endpoints. In conclusion, active rewarming from 33 °C at 0.25 °C/h did not provide an inflammatory or clinical advantage over 0.50 °C/h in this population, and additional research is needed to define the optimal TTM and rewarming strategies after cardiac arrest."
