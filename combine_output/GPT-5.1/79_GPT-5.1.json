      "briefSummary": "This 52‑week, multicenter, randomized, open‑label trial evaluated the long‑term safety, tolerability, and preventive efficacy of fremanezumab in Japanese adults with chronic or episodic migraine. Patients were randomized to receive subcutaneous fremanezumab either monthly or once every 3 months (quarterly). Safety was assessed by monitoring treatment‑emergent adverse events, injection‑site reactions, laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and immunogenicity (anti‑drug antibodies). Efficacy was explored by changes from baseline in monthly migraine days, monthly headache days of at least moderate severity, use of acute headache medications, and headache‑related disability. The study found fremanezumab to be generally well tolerated, with mainly mild to moderate injection‑site reactions and nasopharyngitis, a low rate of discontinuations, and infrequent anti‑drug antibody development, along with sustained reductions in migraine frequency and disability over 12 months.",
      "detailedDescription": "This multicenter, randomized, open‑label, parallel‑group trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03303105) was conducted in Japanese patients with chronic migraine (CM) or episodic migraine (EM) to assess the long‑term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of fremanezumab for migraine prevention. The trial included a 4‑week screening period, a 52‑week treatment period, and a 225‑day post‑treatment follow‑up for anti‑drug antibody (ADA) assessment.\n\nNewly enrolled adult patients had a history of migraine for at least 12 months and fulfilled International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (beta version) criteria (or clinical judgment consistent with migraine). During the 28‑day screening period, EM patients had headache on ≥4 and ≤14 days and CM patients had headache on ≥15 days, with a minimum number of days fulfilling migraine criteria (≥4 days for EM, ≥8 days for CM). A separate cohort of rollover patients from prior phase IIb/III CM and EM trials (Japanese and Korean) was included for immunogenicity evaluation only and did not receive fremanezumab in this study.\n\nNewly enrolled patients were randomized 1:1 using interactive‑response technology, stratified by migraine subtype (CM or EM), to receive either monthly or quarterly fremanezumab by subcutaneous injection. For CM, the monthly regimen consisted of a 675‑mg loading dose (three injections of 225 mg/1.5 mL) at baseline followed by 225 mg monthly. For EM, the monthly regimen was 225 mg at baseline and 225 mg monthly thereafter. For both CM and EM, the quarterly regimen was 675 mg once every 3 months (at baseline, months 3, 6, 9, and 12).\n\nSafety assessments included collection and coding of treatment‑emergent adverse events (TEAEs) by MedDRA, evaluation of their severity, seriousness, and relationship to study drug, and documentation of TEAEs leading to discontinuation. Injection‑site reactions (erythema, induration, ecchymosis, pain) were systematically monitored and graded for size and pain intensity. TEAEs of special interest mirrored those in previous phase IIb/III studies and included injection‑site reactions, potential drug‑induced liver injury, ophthalmic events of at least moderate severity, anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity reactions, and cardiovascular events. Safety monitoring also comprised clinical laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, coagulation, urinalysis), 12‑lead ECGs, physical examinations, vital signs, body weight, and suicidality screening with the Electronic Columbia‑Suicide Severity Rating Scale.\n\nImmunogenicity was assessed in a larger cohort (newly enrolled plus rollover patients) with serial ADA testing. Patients who were ADA‑negative before any fremanezumab exposure and became positive after treatment were classified as having treatment‑emergent ADA. Neutralizing antibody assays were also performed, and potential associations with safety or efficacy outcomes were explored.\n\nEfficacy endpoints for newly enrolled patients were analyzed descriptively in a full analysis set requiring at least 10 days of baseline and post‑baseline entries in an electronic headache diary. Primary efficacy measures included changes from baseline in average monthly migraine days and in monthly headache days of at least moderate severity, normalized to a 28‑day period when ≥10 diary days were available. Additional efficacy outcomes included average monthly headache days of any severity, monthly days with use of any acute headache medication, monthly days with nausea/vomiting, and monthly days with photophobia and phonophobia. Responder analyses examined the proportions of patients achieving ≥50% reductions from baseline in monthly migraine days or monthly headache days of at least moderate severity at months 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12.\n\nDisability and functional impact were measured with validated instruments: the 6‑Item Headache Impact Test (HIT‑6) in CM patients and the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) questionnaire in EM patients. Higher HIT‑6 and MIDAS scores indicate greater headache impact and disability, respectively; changes from baseline at month 12 were summarized.\n\nFifty Japanese patients were newly enrolled and treated (25 monthly, 25 quarterly; 34 with CM and 16 with EM). Most were female (84%), with a mean age of 46.3 years and a long migraine history (mean 20.2 years). Nearly half (46%) were using preventive migraine medications at baseline, and almost all (98%) used acute headache medications; 92% used migraine‑specific acute treatments (triptans or ergot derivatives). The mean baseline monthly migraine days and monthly headache days of at least moderate severity were 13.9 and 12.3, respectively.\n\nTEAEs occurred in 90% of patients overall, most commonly nasopharyngitis (64%) and injection‑site reactions, primarily erythema (24%), induration (10%), pain (8%), and pruritus (6%). All injection‑site reactions were mild or moderate and resolved; one patient discontinued due to an injection‑site reaction. Serious TEAEs occurred in two patients (8%) in the quarterly group (rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and subarachnoid hemorrhage), none considered related to fremanezumab. No deaths, anaphylaxis, severe hypersensitivity reactions, or trial‑agent‑induced liver injury were reported. Cardiovascular TEAEs included hemiparesis (in the context of subarachnoid hemorrhage), tachycardia, increased blood pressure, and hypertension in single patients; these were not judged drug related. Changes in vital signs and ECGs were minor, and no patient developed suicidal ideation or behavior on the C‑SSRS.\n\nIn the immunogenicity cohort of 587 patients, 14 (2.4%) developed treatment‑emergent ADAs, and 12 developed neutralizing antibodies. No clear relationship between ADA positivity and clinical efficacy or safety was identified, and no ADA‑associated anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity occurred.\n\nEfficacy analyses showed that fremanezumab led to early and sustained reductions in migraine and headache frequency. By month 1, monthly migraine days decreased by about 4 days from baseline in both dosing groups, and monthly headache days of at least moderate severity declined by roughly 3.6–4.7 days. At month 12, the mean reduction in monthly migraine days was approximately 5.9 days in the monthly group and 1.6 days in the quarterly group, with corresponding reductions of 4.3 and 2.1 days, respectively, in monthly headache days of at least moderate severity. Similar patterns were seen for headache days of any severity and days with acute medication use, with sustained improvements over 12 months. Responder analyses showed that at 12 months, 43.5% of patients in the monthly group and 22.7% in the quarterly group achieved ≥50% reduction in monthly migraine days; for monthly headache days of at least moderate severity, the corresponding proportions were 34.8% and 18.2%.\n\nHeadache‑related disability improved over time. Among CM patients, mean HIT‑6 scores decreased by about 5 points from baseline to month 12 across both dosing schedules, indicating a clinically meaningful reduction in headache impact. Among EM patients, MIDAS scores also decreased on average, reflecting reduced migraine‑related disability, though variability was high due to the small sample size.\n\nOverall, long‑term monthly or quarterly fremanezumab treatment in Japanese patients with CM or EM showed a favorable safety and immunogenicity profile and produced sustained reductions in migraine frequency, acute medication use, and headache‑related disability over 12 months. The main limitations include the open‑label design, absence of a placebo comparator, and relatively small sample size, which constrain definitive efficacy inferences but support the long‑term safety and tolerability profile established in larger international studies."
