      "briefSummary": "This randomized controlled trial in rural Vietnam tests whether a culturally adapted motivational text messaging program can help adult smokers quit tobacco. Participants are randomly assigned to receive either regular motivational and assessment text messages that encourage quitting, promote use of the Bach Mai Hospital telephone Quitline, and facilitate access to free nicotine replacement therapy, or assessment text messages alone. The main hypothesis is that those receiving motivational messages will have higher smoking cessation rates, greater confidence in their ability to quit, and more frequent use of Quitline counseling and nicotine replacement therapy than those in the control group.",
      "detailedDescription": "This study evaluates an mHealth (mobile health) intervention designed to increase smoking cessation among adult smokers living in rural communes in Hung Yen province, Vietnam. The trial adapts an automated, theory‑based motivational text messaging system previously shown to be effective in the United States and tailors it culturally and linguistically for Vietnamese smokers.\n\nThe design is a two‑arm, community‑based randomized controlled trial with a planned sample of 600 participants (ultimately 750 were recruited to account for attrition). Eligible men and women are current smokers, literate, residents of one of four selected communes (Binh Minh, Viet Hung, Tan Viet, Bach Sam), able to receive and read text messages, and not cognitively impaired or involved in developing the intervention messages. Individual randomization uses a permuted block scheme with varying block sizes, and both participants and research staff are initially blinded to allocation. Follow‑up is conducted at 6 months.\n\nParticipants in the intervention arm receive an intensive schedule of one‑way motivational text messages plus two‑way assessment messages. The motivational stream consists of seven messages during the first week and two messages per week for weeks 2–26. Content is grounded in social cognitive theory and current cessation guidelines and includes both expert‑written and smoker‑written messages. Themes include health risks of tobacco, self‑efficacy, family motivations, quitting tips, and the benefits of contacting the Bach Mai Quitline. The messages were translated into Vietnamese, reviewed by former Quitline users and counselors, and refined through an iterative process. In addition, intervention participants receive weekly assessment texts asking about smoking in the past 24 hours and whether they would like to receive a call from the Quitline. A \"yes\" response triggers a call‑back from Bach Mai Quitline counselors, who provide counseling and can facilitate free nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine lozenges) for up to 6 weeks.\n\nParticipants in the comparison (control) arm receive only twice‑monthly two‑way assessment text messages asking how many times they smoked in the previous 24 hours. They are not proactively encouraged by the study team to use Quitline services or nicotine replacement therapy, although they may seek these services independently through usual care.\n\nThe primary outcome is smoking cessation at 6 months, defined as self‑reported abstinence over the previous 7 days (no smoking, even a single puff) biochemically verified by exhaled carbon monoxide less than 10 ppm. Secondary outcomes include changes in smoking self‑efficacy measured by the 12‑item Smoking Self‑Efficacy Questionnaire (SEQ‑12), changes in craving assessed by the Brief Questionnaire of Smoking Urges, uptake and patterns of Quitline use (number of calls, counseling received), use of nicotine replacement therapy, details of quit attempts, and participant perceptions of the intervention. Assessment data are collected at baseline via in‑person surveys at commune health centers and throughout the 6‑month trial via the text system. Follow‑up visits are conducted in person when possible, with telephone follow‑up as needed.\n\nThe Bach Mai Quitline is staffed by registered nurses and public health professionals trained as tobacco treatment specialists, using principles from motivational interviewing and the 2008 US Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence guidelines, including the 5 As and 5 Rs frameworks. As part of the project, the University of Massachusetts Medical School team provided approximately 10 hours of additional training to Quitline staff on pharmacotherapy, behavioral interventions, individual and telephone counseling, and the relationship between tobacco use and COVID‑19.\n\nSample size calculations assumed a 10% cessation rate in the control group and were designed to detect a 10 percentage point difference between groups with 91% power at a two‑sided alpha of 0.05, accounting for 15–20% attrition. Analyses will follow an intention‑to‑treat approach. Group differences in quit rates will be assessed with chi‑square tests and multivariable logistic regression if adjustment is needed. Changes in self‑efficacy will be analyzed using repeated‑measures analysis of variance and generalized linear models. Standardized differences will be used to assess baseline balance between arms.\n\nThe trial includes data safety and monitoring procedures, overseen by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Risks are considered low, primarily related to the use of nicotine lozenges (with standard contraindications applied) and potential discomfort discussing smoking behavior. Confidentiality is protected through deidentification, secure data systems, and limited access to personal identifiers, which remain in Vietnam. The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the University of Massachusetts Medical School and the Institute of Population, Health and Development in Vietnam and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03567993). The broader aims include not only testing the effectiveness of the text messaging intervention on smoking cessation and treatment uptake, but also building capacity among Quitline staff and strengthening collaborative infrastructure for tobacco control in Vietnam."
