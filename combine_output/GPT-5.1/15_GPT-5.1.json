      "briefSummary": "This study is a psychometric evaluation of the 12‑item Nocturia Impact (NI) Diary, conducted within a randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled Phase 2 trial (DAWN; NCT03201419) of a novel drug for nocturnal polyuria in adults with nocturia. Participants completed the NI Diary and a nocturnal voiding diary over three consecutive nights before clinic visits at baseline and weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12. The objective was to assess whether the NI Diary reliably and validly measures the day‑to‑day impact of nocturia on quality of life and to determine what amount of score change represents a meaningful improvement from the patient’s perspective.",
      "detailedDescription": "This study performed an independent, treatment‑agnostic psychometric validation of the Nocturia Impact (NI) Diary using data from a multicenter, randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled Phase 2 clinical trial (DAWN; NCT03201419) designed to test a novel pharmacologic treatment for nocturnal polyuria in adults with nocturia. The NI Diary is a 12‑item patient‑reported outcome (PRO) instrument, with 11 core items covering sleep disturbance, emotional disturbance, fatigue, activity limitation, worry, and safety concerns, plus a separate global quality‑of‑life (QoL) item. Items are rated on 5‑point severity scales and summarized into an 11‑item total score (0–44, transformed to 0–100) and a separate transformed QoL item.\n\nAdults with nocturia due primarily to nocturnal polyuria completed the NI Diary and a night‑time voiding diary for three consecutive nights prior to study visits at Baseline and Weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12 (end of treatment). The number of nocturnal voids was averaged across the three nights at each visit. Additional measures included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), patient‑rated nocturnal frequency bother, and Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI‑S) and Improvement (PGI‑I). A subset of 66 patients participated in qualitative exit interviews focused on living with nocturia, the relevance and clarity of NI Diary items, and what constitutes a meaningful change in both NI Diary responses and nocturnal voids.\n\nPsychometric analyses, aligned with FDA 2009 PRO guidance, evaluated: (1) quality and completeness of NI Diary data; (2) item distributions and floor/ceiling effects; (3) inter‑item and item–total correlations; (4) item discrimination indices and category response curves; (5) factorial structure via confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using baseline data; (6) internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha); (7) test–retest reliability using intra‑class correlation coefficients (ICC) in relatively stable subgroups; (8) convergent validity with ISI and nocturia bother scores; (9) known‑groups validity using nocturnal void frequency strata (0–2 vs ≥3 voids/night); and (10) interpretation of score changes, including identification of a meaningful change threshold (MCT) using both anchor‑based and distribution‑based methods, supported by qualitative findings from exit interviews.\n\nThe sample comprised 302 intent‑to‑treat participants (mean age 58.8 years, 59.6% female, predominantly White), which exceeded standard psychometric sample size recommendations (≥10 subjects per item). Overall completion of NI Diary items and three‑night diary sets was high (≈83–84% at baseline and week 12), with low levels of completely missing data. Floor and ceiling effects were observed for some items (notably items 8, 10, and 12), but were generally consistent with expected symptom improvement over time under active study treatment.\n\nAt baseline, corrected item–total correlations ranged from 0.607 to 0.841, and inter‑item correlations from 0.427 to 0.844, supporting that items measure a common underlying construct while covering distinct aspects of nocturia impact. Item discrimination indices ranged from 0.535 to 0.915, indicating very good differentiation across severity levels. CFA supported a unidimensional structure for items 1–11, with excellent CFI and TLI and acceptable RMSEA after allowing two conceptually justifiable residual correlations (between activity‑related items 3 and 4, and between sleep‑related items 7 and 9). This confirmed the scoring of a single total NI impact score and separate treatment of the global QoL item (Q12).\n\nInternal consistency of the 11‑item NI Diary was high (Cronbach’s alpha 0.941). Test–retest reliability over baseline to week 1 in relatively stable patients was strong, with ICC estimates between 0.730 and 0.880 depending on the stability anchor (PGI‑I, PGI‑S, nocturnal voids). Convergent validity was demonstrated by a strong correlation with the Insomnia Severity Index (Spearman’s ρ = 0.730) and a moderate correlation with nocturnal frequency bother (ρ = 0.587), reflecting the expected relationships between nocturia impact, sleep disturbance, and nocturia‑related bother. Known‑groups analyses showed that patients with ≥3 nocturnal voids had significantly higher NI Diary scores than those with 0–2 voids (49.6 vs 41.5 on a 0–100 scale; p = 0.0018; standardized effect size ≈0.37), supporting construct validity.\n\nInterpretation of change focused on defining a patient‑centered meaningful change threshold (MCT) for the NI Diary total score. Anchor‑based analyses used changes from baseline to week 12 in: nocturnal void count, PGI‑S, PGI‑I, PGI‑I as reported in exit interviews, and NI Diary Q12. All anchors showed sufficient correlation with change in NI Diary total score (r ≥ 0.389), allowing their use in MCT estimation. Within‑subject changes in NI Diary total score were examined within anchor‑defined categories of change (e.g., \"no change\" vs. 1‑category improvement), with standardized effect sizes generally ≥0.5 for the minimal improvement categories. Cumulative distribution function (CDF) curves demonstrated clear separation between no‑change and improvement groups across anchors, with maximal separation around NI Diary change values of roughly −10 to −20 points.\n\nReceiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses evaluated the NI Diary change score cut points that best discriminated patients with varying thresholds of nocturnal void reduction (≥0.5, ≥1.0, ≥1.5, ≥2.5 voids/night). For a ≥1‑void/night reduction—a level patients described as meaningful—the best cut point for NI Diary change was approximately −9.5 to −11.6 points. Distribution‑based indices yielded lower‑bound estimates for true change beyond measurement error (0.5 SD ≈ 10.9 points; SEM ≈ 5.3 points). Exit interview data showed that 81% of patients considered a 1‑point improvement on each item’s response scale to be meaningful; across 11 items this corresponds to an aggregate change of about 11 points on the total score. Patients also qualitatively confirmed that a 1‑void/night reduction was meaningful and associated with better sleep, less fatigue, improved mood, and better daily functioning.\n\nTriangulating across quantitative anchor‑based results, distribution‑based metrics, ROC analyses, and qualitative patient input, the investigators concluded that a reduction of approximately 10–11 points reflects a minimum meaningful within‑patient improvement, and a more conservative responder definition in the range of a 15–18 point reduction on the 0–100 NI Diary total score represents a robust threshold for clinically meaningful benefit. The study thus provides evidence that the NI Diary is a reliable, valid, and interpretable PRO instrument suitable for use as an endpoint in clinical trials and potentially in real‑world studies to quantify the impact of nocturia and treatment‑related improvements in patient quality of life."
