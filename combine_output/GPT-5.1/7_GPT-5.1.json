      "briefSummary": "This phase I clinical trial evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (how the body absorbs, distributes, and eliminates a drug), and pharmacodynamics (biological effects) of trazpiroben (TAK‑906), a new peripherally selective dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist being developed to treat chronic gastroparesis. The study enrolled 24 healthy Japanese men who were randomized in a double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, parallel‑group design to receive oral trazpiroben at doses of 10 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg (single dose on day 1, then twice daily on days 3–7) or placebo. Safety outcomes, blood and urine drug levels, and changes in serum prolactin (a marker of D2 receptor blockade) were measured. Results were compared descriptively with those from a prior similar study in healthy participants in the United States to assess potential ethnic differences in trazpiroben disposition and effects.",
      "detailedDescription": "This was a phase I, randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, single‑ and multiple‑ascending dose, parallel‑group study designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of trazpiroben (TAK‑906) in healthy Japanese men. Trazpiroben is a novel, peripherally selective dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist under development for the chronic treatment of gastroparesis, a gastric motility disorder characterized by delayed gastric emptying and symptoms such as early satiety, postprandial fullness, nausea, vomiting, bloating, and abdominal pain.\n\nA total of 24 healthy Japanese male participants (age 20–60 years, BMI 18.5–25 kg/m², body weight ≥50 kg) were enrolled and allocated to 3 parallel cohorts (n = 8 per cohort). In each cohort, 6 participants received active trazpiroben and 2 received placebo. Cohort 1 received 50 mg, cohort 2 received up to 100 mg (dose selected based on blinded review of preceding safety and PK data), and cohort 3 received 10 mg. All participants received a single oral dose of blinded study drug on day 1 (single‑dose phase), followed by twice‑daily dosing from day 3 through day 7 (multiple‑dose phase), with no evening dose on day 7. Morning doses were administered after at least a 10‑hour fast, and evening doses were given 12 hours after the morning dose and at least 2 hours after the evening meal.\n\nInclusion criteria required healthy Japanese men with no clinically significant medical history, particularly no seizure or tardive dyskinesia, hyperprolactinemia, pituitary adenoma, hypothyroidism, or gastrointestinal diseases that could affect drug absorption. Participants with prolonged QTc, abnormal liver or kidney function, or abnormal ECGs at screening or baseline were excluded.\n\nSafety assessments included continuous monitoring of treatment‑emergent adverse events (TEAEs), physical examinations, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and 12‑lead ECGs at multiple time points after dosing on specified study days. No serious or severe AEs occurred, and no participants discontinued due to AEs. Only five mild TEAEs were reported (pharyngitis, increased creatinine, increased lactate dehydrogenase, and others), none in more than one participant and none considered related to trazpiroben. There were no QTc prolongation–associated, neurological, or hyperprolactinemia‑associated TEAEs, and no clinically meaningful differences in laboratory tests, vital signs, or ECGs between trazpiroben and placebo groups.\n\nFor PK analysis, plasma samples for trazpiroben and its pharmacologically inactive metabolite M23 were collected before and at multiple time points up to 24 hours after dosing on days 1, 2, 7, and 8, and pre‑dose on days 3–6. Urine samples were collected over defined intervals on days 1, 2, and 7. Trazpiroben and M23 concentrations in plasma and urine were quantified using validated LC‑MS/MS methods. PK parameters included Cmax, AUC (various intervals), tmax, elimination half‑life (t1/2z), fraction excreted in urine, and renal clearance.\n\nTrazpiroben showed rapid absorption (median tmax ~1 hour, and tmax at steady state ~1.0–1.3 hours) and relatively rapid elimination (mean t1/2z ~1.9–5.2 hours after a single dose and 3.7–6.5 hours after multiple doses). Cmax ranged from 7.2 to 64.7 ng/mL after single doses, and Cmax at steady state from 8.0 to 81.8 ng/mL. Cmax and AUC increased in a dose‑proportional or approximately dose‑proportional manner over the 10–100 mg range for both trazpiroben and M23. Minimal accumulation was observed after twice‑daily dosing for 5 days, with accumulation ratios based on AUC and Cmax generally around 1.1–1.8. Urinary excretion parameters were similar between day 1 and day 7 and across doses.\n\nPharmacodynamically, serum prolactin concentrations were used as a biomarker of dopamine D2 receptor antagonism. Blood for prolactin was collected at similar time points to PK sampling. After trazpiroben administration, prolactin levels increased rapidly compared with placebo, with a median tmax of about 1 hour for single doses and 1–2 hours at steady state. Prolactin t1/2z ranged from about 13.9–29.1 hours after single dosing and 71.3–84.7 hours after multiple dosing. Mean prolactin Cmax values during the single‑dose phase ranged from about 79.0 to 93.6 ng/mL with trazpiroben versus 10.8 ng/mL with placebo, and steady‑state Cmax ranged from about 41.9 to 78.8 ng/mL with trazpiroben versus 11.9 ng/mL with placebo. Increases in prolactin exposure with higher trazpiroben doses were less than dose‑proportional, suggesting that a near‑maximal pharmacodynamic effect is achieved at the lowest 10‑mg dose. Little accumulation of prolactin was observed with repeated dosing.\n\nFindings from this Japanese study were compared informally with those from a prior phase I study in predominantly White and Black/African American healthy participants in the United States (AT‑01C, NCT03268941). PK parameters, including Cmax and AUC, were generally similar between Japanese and US populations, with overlapping distributions of individual exposures, although median values were slightly higher in Japanese participants. Serum prolactin responses also overlapped between studies, with near‑maximal increases already at the 10‑mg dose and minimal accumulation upon multiple dosing in both ethnic groups. These results indicate no clinically relevant ethnic difference in trazpiroben disposition or pharmacodynamic profile between Japanese and US participants.\n\nOverall, trazpiroben administered as single and multiple oral doses of 10, 50, and 100 mg was well tolerated in healthy Japanese men and demonstrated predictable, approximately dose‑proportional PK and robust PD target engagement via prolactin release, consistent with D2/D3 receptor antagonism. The safety and PK/PD profiles were highly similar to those observed in the US phase I study, supporting the potential for trazpiroben to be used across different ethnic populations for the chronic treatment of gastroparesis. Further evaluation is ongoing in phase II studies in patients with idiopathic or diabetic gastroparesis (e.g., NCT03544229)."
