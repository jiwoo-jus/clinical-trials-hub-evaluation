      "briefSummary": "This randomized controlled trial tested Proud & Empowered (P&E), a 10‑session, school-based, small-group intervention for sexual and gender minority adolescents (SGMA). The program is designed to reduce minority stress (such as discrimination, family rejection, and internalized homonegativity) and to improve mental health outcomes including depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and suicidality. Four high schools in a Southern California district were randomized to either receive the P&E intervention during the school day or to continue with classes as usual (control). SGMA students completed questionnaires on minority stress and mental health symptoms before and after the 10‑week program. The study hypothesized that youth in the intervention schools would report lower minority stress and better mental health, and that participation in P&E would weaken the link between minority stress and negative mental health outcomes.",
      "detailedDescription": "This study evaluated the preliminary efficacy of Proud & Empowered (P&E), a theory‑driven, school‑based preventive intervention for sexual and gender minority adolescents (SGMA), defined as youth who identify as non‑heterosexual and/or whose gender identity does not align with sex assigned at birth. SGMA experience elevated rates of internalizing psychopathology (depression, anxiety, self‑harm, posttraumatic stress disorder) and externalizing outcomes (substance use, suicidal behavior) relative to heterosexual, cisgender peers. Minority stress theory posits that discrimination, violence, and victimization contribute to chronic minority stress, which in turn drives these behavioral health disparities.\n\nP&E was developed using the NIH Intervention Stage Model and informed by extensive qualitative and quantitative work, including creation of the Sexual Minority Adolescent Stress Inventory (SMASI), a validated 54‑item measure capturing 10 minority stress domains (social marginalization, family rejection, internalized homonegativity, identity management, homonegative climate, intersectionality, negative disclosure experiences, religion, negative expectancies, and homonegative communication). Each of P&E’s 10 sessions maps onto these domains and includes content on stress and coping, disclosure decision‑making, family, school climate, peers and friendship, relationship safety, spirituality and religion, race/ethnicity and social justice, LGBTQ community and history, and intersections of health, substance use, HIV, and the medical system. Sessions use psychoeducation, guided discussion, and interactive activities, and are delivered in ~45‑minute weekly class‑period groups.\n\nThe randomized controlled trial was conducted in fall 2019 in four diverse public high schools in a unified Southern California district, all of which had gender and sexuality alliances but no other SGMA‑specific programming. Schools (not individual students) were randomized to intervention or control. In intervention schools, SGMA students attended P&E once weekly during an advisory/homeroom period, led by a project coordinator and a trained school staff co‑facilitator; in control schools, SGMA students attended regular classes and received no additional SGMA‑specific program. All participants completed pretest assessments one week before the first session and posttest assessments one week after the final session, with gift‑card incentives.\n\nEligibility criteria included being enrolled at one of the four high schools, English‑speaking, self‑identifying as LGBT or other non‑heterosexual or non‑cisgender identity, and able to provide assent/consent. Due to confidentiality concerns and risk of forced disclosure of sexual or gender identity, parental consent was waived by the institutional review board. The study ultimately retained 44 participants (26 intervention, 18 control; 95.6% retention), with no significant baseline differences between conditions in demographic variables or in minority stress and mental health measures.\n\nOutcome measures included: (1) minority stress (SMASI total and 10 subscales); (2) anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory); (3) depression (Beck Depression Inventory‑II); (4) PTSD symptoms (PTSD Checklist for DSM‑5, plus a 6‑item PTSD index); and (5) suicidality (adapted Columbia‑Suicide Severity Rating Scale, scored by worst‑point severity in the past 30 days). Demographic characteristics (gender identity, sex assigned at birth, age, grade, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, religion, language, work status, and living situation) were collected at both time points. Fidelity monitoring documented adherence to curriculum, dosage, quality of delivery, participant responsiveness, and cultural appropriateness.\n\nAnalytically, the study used chi‑square tests and one‑way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) to verify baseline equivalence between groups, then two‑by‑two (group × time) repeated‑measures ANOVAs to test condition differences over time on minority stress (SMASI total and subscales) and mental health outcomes. Moderation analyses were conducted using multiple regression (PROCESS in SPSS) to test whether intervention condition moderated the associations between minority stress and each mental health outcome at posttest, controlling for baseline symptom levels.\n\nResults showed a significant group × time interaction for the SMASI internalized homonegativity subscale: intervention participants showed a decrease in internalized homonegativity from pre‑ to posttest, while control participants showed an increase. There were no significant group × time interactions for SMASI total or other subscales, or for the main mental health outcomes, in this small sample. However, descriptive patterns indicated that intervention youth reported reduced anxiety and stable depression symptoms, whereas control youth showed no change in anxiety and increased depression.\n\nModeration analyses revealed significant intervention × minority stress interactions for PTSD, depression, and suicidality. Among control participants, higher minority stress at posttest tended to be associated with higher PTSD, depression, and suicidality scores. Among intervention participants, these associations were attenuated or reversed, such that higher minority stress was not associated with increased symptoms and in some cases trended toward lower symptom levels. These findings suggest that P&E may mitigate the impact of minority stress on PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation/behavior, potentially by enhancing coping skills and social support, even when distal stressors (e.g., school climate, family rejection) remain present.\n\nThe trial had several limitations, notably the small sample size from a single, urban school district, which limited statistical power, precluded subgroup analyses (e.g., by race/ethnicity or gender identity), and restricted generalizability. Additionally, planned longer‑term follow‑up was not possible due to COVID‑19–related school closures. Despite these limitations, the study provides preliminary evidence that Proud & Empowered reduces specific aspects of minority stress (particularly internalized homonegativity) and buffers the relationship between minority stress and key mental health outcomes in SGMA. The intervention is positioned as an individually chosen, school‑based program that does not rely on family involvement, addressing a critical gap in psychoeducational and preventive services for sexual and gender minority adolescents.\n\nThe trial was approved by the USC Social Behavioral IRB and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04041414). Funding was provided by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)."
