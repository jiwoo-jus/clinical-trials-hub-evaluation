      "briefSummary": "This randomized controlled trial evaluated the Korean adaptation of the Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills for Young Adults (PEERS®-YA-K) for high-functioning young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) aged 18–35 years. The original US PEERS®-YA manual was translated and culturally adapted, with a particular focus on dating etiquette and examples of social activities relevant to Korean young adults. Thirty-seven participants with ASD and IQ ≥ 70, along with their social coaches (mainly parents), were randomized to an immediate treatment group or a delayed treatment (waitlist) group. The intervention consisted of 16 weekly 90‑minute group sessions for young adults and parallel sessions for social coaches. The study examined whether PEERS®-YA-K improved social skills knowledge, observable social functioning, adaptive behavior, and reduced depression and anxiety, and whether gains were maintained at 4‑month follow‑up.",
      "detailedDescription": "This study investigated the effectiveness and cultural feasibility of the Korean version of the Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills for Young Adults (PEERS®-YA-K) for young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Because social difficulties, including challenges in friendships and romantic relationships, often persist into adulthood for individuals with ASD, and evidence-based interventions for this age group are scarce, the authors aimed to translate and culturally adapt the original American PEERS®-YA curriculum and then test it in a randomized controlled trial (RCT).\n\nThe intervention manual was first translated into Korean by PEERS®-certified providers and reviewed by autism specialists. To ensure cultural and ecological validity, the team conducted intensive interviews with 29 typically developing Korean young adults to gather detailed information about dating etiquette, common social activities, peer groups, and strategies for handling bullying in Korea. Based on these interviews, specific rules and examples, especially those related to dating and social activities, were modified, while preserving the original structure and core treatment principles.\n\nThe PEERS®-YA-K program consists of 16 weekly 90‑minute group sessions delivered concurrently to young adults and their social coaches (primarily mothers, but also fathers and one mentor) in separate groups. Didactic lessons and behavioral rehearsal target conversational skills, electronic communication, developing friendship networks, using humor appropriately, entering and exiting peer groups, organizing get-togethers, handling teasing and bullying, managing peer pressure and conflict, as well as skills specific to dating such as showing romantic interest, asking someone on a date, going on dates, and following general dating guidelines. Social coaches are trained in the same content to support practice and generalization at home and in the community. Treatment fidelity was high (average 0.95).\n\nParticipants were recruited from a university hospital clinic and community ASD-related organizations. Inclusion criteria included age 18–35 years, high school graduate or about to graduate, clinically recognized social difficulties, a confirmed or suspected ASD diagnosis, verbal fluency, full-scale IQ ≥ 70 (K-WAIS-IV), and motivation to participate. Exclusion criteria included major mental illness (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, psychosis, acute self-harm risk), significant sensory or physical disabilities, serious neurological or medical conditions limiting group participation, and inability of the social coach to engage in the program. ASD diagnosis was confirmed by board-certified child psychiatrists using DSM‑5 criteria supported by ADOS‑2 and ADI‑R.\n\nThirty-seven young adults with ASD and their social coaches were randomized via block randomization to an immediate treatment group (TG; n=19) or a delayed treatment group (DTG; n=18; waitlist control). Formal social skills group training and new therapies were prohibited for DTG during the waiting period; however, usual care (e.g., individual counseling, follow-up visits, pharmacotherapy) was allowed. Ultimately, 31 participants (TG=17, DTG=14) completed the 16‑week intervention; the overall completion rate was 83.78%. The sample was predominantly male (only one female), with mean age around 23.4 years and average IQ around 100. Most were students or unemployed, and the majority of social coaches were mothers.\n\nOutcome assessments were conducted at multiple time points. The TG and DTG both completed measures at baseline and immediately post-intervention; the DTG also completed an additional pre-treatment assessment at the end of their waitlist period; both groups completed a 4‑month post-treatment follow‑up. Primary outcomes addressed ASD-related social difficulties and included: ADOS‑2 Module 4 (clinician-observed social communication and restricted/repetitive behaviors), the Test of Young Adult Social Skills Knowledge (TYASSK), the Korean Social Skills Rating System (K-SSRS; self and parent report), and the Social Responsiveness Scale‑2 (SRS‑2; self and caregiver report). Secondary outcomes included adaptive functioning (communication, daily living skills, socialization) measured by the Korean Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (K‑VABS) and depressive symptoms measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Exploratory measures included the Quality of Socialization Questionnaire (QSQ; frequency of get-togethers and dates), the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), and anxiety measures (Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI] and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI-S, STAI-T]).\n\nStatistical analyses included baseline comparisons, repeated measures ANOVA with treatment (TG vs DTG) by time interactions, and paired t‑tests for within-group pre/post and follow‑up comparisons. Several models progressively controlled for age, IQ, medication use, and homework completion rate as covariates. Effect sizes were estimated using Cohen’s d.\n\nBetween-group analyses showed a significant treatment-by-time effect favoring the PEERS®-YA-K group for social skills knowledge as measured by the TYASSK, indicating that the intervention effectively improved understanding of targeted social skills beyond changes observed in the waitlist group. Covariates such as age, IQ, medication, and homework completion were associated with some outcomes, but the primary consistent effect was on social knowledge.\n\nIn within-group analyses pooling all participants who eventually received PEERS®-YA-K, significant improvements were observed from pre- to post-treatment in TYASSK scores and self-rated social skills (K‑SSRS), as well as in parent-rated adaptive communication (K‑VABS). Although immediate post-treatment changes were limited on some functional social behavior measures and mood/anxiety scales, several domains showed significant improvement at the 4‑month follow‑up. These longer-term gains included maintained improvements in social skills knowledge (TYASSK), better parent-rated social responsiveness (SRS‑2), enhanced ADOS‑2 social interaction scores, improved communication and daily living skills on the K‑VABS, and reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms (BAI, BDI).\n\nHomework completion, which indexed participant engagement in practicing skills between sessions, was around 50% on average. Participants with higher homework completion rates showed broader and larger improvements, including greater gains in social skills knowledge (TYASSK), socialization (K‑VABS), and social skills (K‑SSRS), as well as anxiety reduction, underscoring the importance of real-life practice and caregiver-supported generalization.\n\nOverall, the study suggests that a modestly culturally adapted PEERS®-YA program is feasible and acceptable for Korean young adults with high-functioning ASD, achieving high attendance, strong treatment fidelity, and good satisfaction. The intervention reliably improved social skills knowledge and, over time, was associated with improvements in observed social interaction, adaptive functioning, and emotional symptoms. However, immediate, robust changes in functional social behavior (e.g., frequency of get-togethers and dates) were less evident than in some previous US trials. The authors discuss potential reasons, including cultural context (stigma towards ASD, limited social opportunities for young adults, heavy academic/work demands) and limitations of available outcome measures for real-world social functioning in Korean adults with ASD. They note that while increased social skills knowledge was clearly demonstrated, translation into real-world functional gains may depend on individual factors, environmental opportunities, and sustained practice.\n\nLimitations include reliance on self- and parent-report measures, the use of ADOS‑2 as a primary observational outcome despite its design as a diagnostic tool, lack of blinded third-party raters, small sample size, medication heterogeneity, and the waitlist (rather than active control) design. The authors conclude that PEERS®-YA-K is a promising, culturally adapted, evidence-based social skills intervention for Korean young adults with ASD and highlight the need for further research on predictors of functional change and the interplay between social skills, anxiety, and depression."
