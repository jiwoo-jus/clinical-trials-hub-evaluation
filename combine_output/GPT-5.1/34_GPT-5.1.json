      "briefSummary": "This pilot clinical trial evaluated whether a wearable neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) device applied to the common peroneal nerve can improve leg vein blood flow, reduce leg swelling, and enhance quality of life in adults with chronic venous disease, compared with its effects in healthy volunteers. Forty subjects (10 healthy and 30 with different patterns of venous disease: superficial insufficiency, deep insufficiency, or deep obstruction) used bilateral NMES devices for 4–6 hours per day, 5 days a week, over 6 weeks. The main hypothesis was that repeated NMES use would enhance venous haemodynamics, reduce oedema, and improve disease severity and patient-reported quality of life, especially in those with more severe venous disease.",
      "detailedDescription": "This controlled interventional trial (VeINS Trial; NCT02137499) investigated the haemodynamic and clinical effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) in healthy subjects and patients with chronic venous disease (CVD). CVD arises from impaired venous return due to superficial or deep venous insufficiency or obstruction, leading to venous hypertension, leg swelling, symptoms, and complications such as venous ulcers. Existing treatments (surgery, compression hosiery, layered bandaging, intermittent pneumatic compression) primarily aim to reduce venous stasis and improve venous return.\n\nThe study used the geko™ T‑1 NMES device (Firstkind Ltd, UK), which delivers intermittent transcutaneous electrical stimulation (27 mA, 1 Hz, adjustable pulse width 70–560 μs) to the common peroneal nerve at the knee. This elicits contractions of the anterior and lateral leg muscles to activate the calf muscle pump while the subject is at rest. There was no pre‑existing treatment protocol for venous disease, so the investigators specified a pragmatic regimen: bilateral application of the device for 4–6 hours per day, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks. Subjects were trained to self‑apply and adjust the device, and completed usage diaries.\n\nForty adults (>18 years) were recruited: 10 healthy volunteers and 30 patients with venous disease. Venous patients were stratified according to duplex ultrasound findings into superficial venous insufficiency, deep venous insufficiency, or deep venous obstruction, recognizing that some had mixed patterns. Exclusion criteria included peripheral arterial disease, leg fracture or metallic implants, and systemic causes of limb swelling (heart, lung, or renal failure). Baseline assessments included medical history, physical examination, pregnancy testing in women, ankle–brachial pressure index, and detailed venous duplex ultrasound with reflux defined as >0.5 s. Disease severity was classified using CEAP clinical class.\n\nThe primary physiological outcomes were femoral vein haemodynamic parameters and microcirculatory flow. Venous peak velocity (PV), time‑averaged mean velocity (TAMV), and volume flow (VF) were measured by duplex ultrasound in the right femoral vein 3–5 cm from the saphenofemoral junction. Laser Doppler fluximetry was recorded from the dorsum of the left hand and foot to assess changes in microvascular flux. Measurements were taken after a 10‑minute rest, with the NMES device off, and then 20 minutes after device activation at a comfortable stimulation setting. Haemodynamic testing was repeated at week 6 following the 6‑week NMES usage period.\n\nLeg volume was estimated bilaterally using circumferential measurements at the ankle and maximal calf, along with the vertical distance between them, and applying a truncated inverted cone model to calculate volume. This allowed evaluation of changes in leg oedema over the 6‑week treatment period.\n\nClinical and patient‑reported outcomes included the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS), Venous Disability Score (VDS), Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ), EuroQol‑5D (EQ‑5D), Short Form‑12 (SF‑12), and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES‑D). These were collected at baseline (week 0), after treatment (week 6), and two weeks after stopping NMES (week 8) to assess durability of effect. Patients were also grouped by CEAP class into mild disease (C0–3) and severe disease (C4–6) for analysis of quality‑of‑life changes.\n\nAnalyses compared demographic and baseline characteristics across groups with ANOVA, and haemodynamic parameters as changes from baseline between healthy subjects and pooled venous patients, as well as between venous subgroups. Normality was tested with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test; appropriate parametric or non‑parametric tests were then applied, with significance at p<0.05.\n\nResults showed that NMES acutely increased femoral peak velocity, TAMV, and volume flow in patients with venous disease, with gains generally smaller in deep venous disease and obstruction. Regular use over 6 weeks further enhanced PV and TAMV in both healthy and diseased subjects. Laser Doppler fluximetry increased markedly in the leg and arm, indicating improved microcirculatory flow, although leg responses were attenuated in deep venous disease. Over 6 weeks, unilateral leg volume decreased by approximately 12% in venous patients, indicating a clinically meaningful reduction in oedema, whereas healthy participants showed minimal change.\n\nQuality‑of‑life and clinical severity scores tended to improve among patients with venous pathology, particularly those with severe disease (CEAP C4–6), with reductions in VDS and AVVQ scores and improvements in SF‑12. The only statistically significant change was an improvement in VDS from week 0 to week 6, but several changes were considered clinically relevant. Improvements in venous clinical scores persisted two weeks after stopping NMES.\n\nAbout 23% of subjects, all with severe venous disease and higher BMI, did not exhibit a visible muscle twitch at maximum device output, limiting treatment effectiveness in these individuals. Devices were generally well tolerated; some participants experienced skin irritation at the application site, which resolved with cessation and topical emollients.\n\nIn summary, the study demonstrates that NMES via a portable peroneal nerve stimulator can acutely and chronically improve venous haemodynamics, reduce leg oedema, and potentially improve quality of life in patients with chronic venous disease. The therapy may be useful as an adjunctive measure in chronic venous insufficiency and may have a role in venous thromboembolism prophylaxis where anticoagulation or compression is limited, though thrombosis outcomes were not directly assessed in this trial."
