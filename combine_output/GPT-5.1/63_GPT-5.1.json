      "briefSummary": "This single-center, pragmatic randomized controlled trial (the BRIDGE trial) is evaluating whether referral to a hospital-based, multidisciplinary \"bridge\" clinic improves outcomes for hospitalized adults with opioid use disorder (OUD) who are starting medications for OUD (MOUD) during an inpatient stay. Eligible patients at Vanderbilt University Hospital who initiate buprenorphine-naloxone or intramuscular naltrexone in consultation with the addiction consult service are randomized to be offered follow-up in a co-located bridge clinic or to receive usual discharge planning and referral to community MOUD providers. The main hypothesis is that proactive linkage to the bridge clinic will reduce hospital length of stay and readmissions, improve linkage to ongoing MOUD care, reduce relapse and overdose, enhance quality of life, and lower overall costs of care compared with usual care.",
      "detailedDescription": "The Bridging Recovery Initiative Despite Gaps in Entry (BRIDGE) trial is a pragmatic, single-center, superiority, randomized controlled trial conducted at Vanderbilt University Hospital, an ~800-bed tertiary care adult hospital in Nashville, Tennessee. The study is embedded in routine clinical care and evaluates the effectiveness of a newly implemented, multidisciplinary, hospital-based \"bridge\" clinic designed to provide transitional addiction care for patients with opioid use disorder (OUD).\n\nBackground and Rationale:\nPatients with substance use disorders, particularly OUD, are overrepresented among general hospital inpatients and often experience longer lengths of stay and higher readmission rates. Despite evidence that medications for OUD (MOUD), such as buprenorphine-naloxone and naltrexone, improve treatment retention, reduce illicit use, and decrease overdose deaths, access to MOUD after hospital discharge is limited. Transitional \"bridge\" clinics have emerged to address care fragmentation by rapidly linking hospitalized patients to low-threshold, multidisciplinary addiction care within the same health system. However, the effectiveness of this model has not been rigorously evaluated.\n\nStudy Objectives and Hypothesis:\nThe primary objective is to determine whether offering referral to the bridge clinic reduces index hospital length of stay (LOS) for patients hospitalized with OUD who initiate MOUD during their admission. Secondary objectives include assessing whether the intervention improves linkage to MOUD care, MOUD prescription fill rates, recurrence of opioid use, emergency department (ED) visits, readmission rates, hospital- and ED-free days, quality of life, overdose, mortality, and total cost of care. Additional objectives among patients with injection-related infections include evaluating infection outcomes and the feasibility of outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT). The central hypothesis is that proactive linkage via the bridge clinic will reduce LOS and healthcare utilization while improving clinical and patient-centered outcomes compared with usual discharge planning.\n\nDesign and Population:\nThe trial began on 25 November 2019 and is planned to run for approximately 18 months. It enrolls adults (≥18 years) hospitalized with active OUD who are being considered for MOUD by the addiction consult service and who accept a transitional prescription for buprenorphine-naloxone or intramuscular naltrexone. Eligible patients must not already have a fixed outpatient MOUD plan (e.g., a pre-existing MOUD provider relationship they intend to continue) and must reside in Middle Tennessee counties to ensure feasible follow-up. Exclusions include severe active psychiatric disorders requiring a higher level of psychiatric care, patients for whom methadone maintenance is deemed the most appropriate MOUD, prior randomization in the trial, or prior referral to the bridge clinic before trial initiation.\n\nRandomization and Arms:\nPatients are identified via electronic consult orders or referrals to the addiction consult service. After clinical evaluation and confirmation of eligibility, the addiction consult service social worker randomizes patients through REDCap using a pre-specified sequence with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Randomization is capacity-constrained: the bridge clinic has fixed weekly intake capacity, and randomization is used to allocate limited clinic slots fairly and to create a comparison group among those who could otherwise be referred.\n\nIntervention arm (Bridge clinic referral):\nPatients randomized to the intervention are offered referral to a co-located, multidisciplinary bridge clinic operating all day on Fridays. The clinic provides wraparound services regardless of insurance status, with grant-funded medications and institutional write-off of visit and laboratory charges for uninsured patients. The clinical team includes addiction psychiatry, internal medicine, infectious diseases, pain-anesthesia physicians, a psychiatric nurse practitioner, social workers, a nurse case manager, and recovery coaches. Patients are initially asked to attend weekly visits for the first 8 weeks (if maintaining abstinence), then twice monthly, with an intended stabilization and transition period of up to 3 months (flexible up to about a year). Each visit typically includes at least one medical provider and one non-medical provider (for psychotherapy, peer support, or case management), urine toxicology testing, and close coordination of care, including prescription refills for controlled medications (e.g., buprenorphine) in short (e.g., 7-day) supplies during early treatment.\n\nThe bridge clinic supports transitions from inpatient care, the emergency department, and other institutional settings, and facilitates referral to longer-term addiction treatment (e.g., primary care-based MOUD, intensive outpatient, residential programs) and management of co-occurring conditions. Team huddles are used to coordinate care and identify patients needing a higher level of care. For certain patients with injection-related infections, the trial incorporates a structured assessment of candidacy for outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT), including evaluation of housing stability, caregiver support, and feasibility of home-based intravenous antibiotic administration.\n\nControl arm (Usual care):\nPatients randomized to usual care receive standard discharge planning by the primary medical team’s social worker. The addiction consult service continues usual inpatient care, including MOUD initiation and management of comorbidities. The primary team’s social worker then arranges outpatient MOUD and recovery resources tailored to the patient's insurance coverage, transportation options, and preferences. The bridge clinic is not available outside the trial for otherwise study-eligible patients during the study period.\n\nOutcomes and Data Collection:\nData are drawn from the electronic health record (EHR) and ancillary systems as part of usual care and managed in REDCap. Demographic and clinical data, as well as hospital utilization metrics, are routinely captured.\n\nPrimary outcome:\n- Index hospital length of stay (LOS).\n\nSecondary outcomes (over 16-week follow-up):\n- Linkage to a MOUD provider (at least one post-discharge MOUD visit, self-reported).\n- Self-reported buprenorphine-naloxone or naltrexone prescriptions filled.\n- Hospital readmission rates and number of ED visits.\n- Hospital-free days and ED-free days.\n- Recurrent opioid use, including self-reported relapse and frequency of use in the preceding 30 days.\n- Overall quality of life and psychological well-being measured by the Schwartz Outcome Scale-10 (SOS-10) and EQ-5D-5L.\n- Overdose events.\n- All-cause mortality.\n- Costs of care for the index admission and subsequent resource utilization (e.g., readmissions, ED use), as provided by institutional finance systems.\n\nAdditional infection-related outcomes among patients with injection-related infections considered for OPAT include:\n- New, persistent, or recurrent infection (based on positive cultures and/or change in antibiotic regimen).\n- Completion of antibiotic therapy.\n- Days from first negative blood culture to initial hospital discharge.\n\nImplementation outcomes include: willingness to accept referral to the bridge clinic, attendance rates among those offered bridge clinic care, cross-over between arms, and reasons for ineligibility or non-participation.\n\nFollow-up Procedures:\nAs part of routine addiction consult service practice, patients initiated on MOUD receive a 16-week follow-up phone call, regardless of trial arm. During this call, staff collect information on MOUD follow-up attendance, relapse to illicit opioid use, overdose occurrences, and self-reported quality of life metrics. Up to three call attempts are made, supplemented by text messages through institutional mobile devices or the patient portal to improve response rates. Alternative contacts are used when possible; some patients may be unreachable due to incarceration, death, or other barriers.\n\nStatistical Considerations:\nAnalyses will follow an intent-to-treat principle. The primary analysis will compare LOS between groups using generalized linear models with covariate adjustment; alternative models (e.g., proportional hazards or gamma with log link) may be used if LOS is strongly skewed. Binary secondary outcomes (e.g., linkage to MOUD, readmission, overdose) will be analyzed with logistic regression, ordinal outcomes with proportional odds models, and cost outcomes with models appropriate for skewed data (e.g., gamma or time-to-event approaches). Multiple imputation will address missing covariates. A two-sided significance level of 0.05 will be used for the primary endpoint.\n\nPower and Sample Size:\nInitial pre-implementation data suggested a mean LOS of 15 days (SD ~15). A sample size of 700 patients (350 per arm) was initially targeted to provide ≥80–90% power to detect clinically meaningful reductions in LOS (e.g., 3 days). Due to COVID-19-related disruptions and lower than expected enrollment, an interim blinded re-estimation found a mean LOS of 9 days (SD 11). Assuming a 1.5-day reduction in LOS is clinically meaningful, approximately 168 patients per group (336 total) would provide ≥80% power. With an accrual rate of ~4 patients per week, the revised sample size is considered achievable.\n\nEthics and Trial Status:\nThe study is conducted within the Vanderbilt Learning Healthcare System framework and is approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board with a waiver of informed consent (IRB #191269), recognizing that the intervention is an operational clinical program being evaluated pragmatically. Patients can decline attending the bridge clinic if offered, but participation in the randomized evaluation itself is not consent-based. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04084392). At the time of the report, the trial was ongoing with enrollment expected to complete in fall 2021.\n\nPlanned Dissemination:\nUpon completion, results will be published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at conferences, and posted on ClinicalTrials.gov. De-identified datasets and statistical code will be made available upon reasonable request with appropriate ethical approvals. Findings are intended to guide local and broader practice regarding integration of hospital-based addiction services and transitional bridge clinics for patients with OUD."
