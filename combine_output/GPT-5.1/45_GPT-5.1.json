      "briefSummary": "This multicentre, open-label, randomised, Bayesian phase 2/3 clinical trial (CORIMUNO-SARI-1), nested within the French CORIMUNO-19 cohort, evaluated whether sarilumab, an anti–interleukin-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, improves outcomes in adults hospitalised with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, required at least 3 L/min of oxygen, had a WHO Clinical Progression Scale score of 5, and were not receiving any form of ventilatory support. Participants were randomly assigned to receive usual care alone or usual care plus intravenous sarilumab 400 mg on day 1, with an optional second 400 mg dose on day 3 if oxygen needs had not decreased sufficiently. The co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with clinical worsening (WHO score >5) at day 4 and survival without need for non-invasive or mechanical ventilation at day 14. Among 148 randomised patients, sarilumab did not reduce early clinical worsening or the need for ventilation or death by day 14 compared with usual care, and 90‑day survival was similar between groups. Safety profiles, including serious adverse events, were comparable, indicating that sarilumab did not confer a clear short-term benefit in this population.",
      "detailedDescription": "The CORIMUNO-SARI-1 trial is part of the CORIMUNO-19 platform, a series of cohort-embedded, adaptive, open-label randomised controlled trials conducted in six French hospitals during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The rationale is based on the observation that patients with COVID-19 pneumonia often exhibit a hyperinflammatory response with elevated cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), which may drive lung injury and respiratory failure. Sarilumab is a high-affinity monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), designed to block IL-6 signalling and potentially mitigate this hyperinflammatory state.\n\nAdults (≥18 years) hospitalised with laboratory-confirmed or CT-supported SARS-CoV-2 infection were eligible for the CORIMUNO-19 cohort if they had pneumonia ranging from mild-to-critical. For CORIMUNO-SARI-1 specifically, patients had moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia defined by a WHO Clinical Progression Scale (WHO-CPS) score of 5 (hospitalised, requiring oxygen by mask or nasal prongs), needing at least 3 L/min of oxygen, and not receiving high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, or invasive mechanical ventilation at enrolment. Pregnant women and other patients meeting predefined exclusion criteria were not enrolled.\n\nParticipants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio via a secure web system to receive either usual care alone or usual care plus sarilumab. Randomisation was stratified by centre and used randomly varying block sizes. The trial was open-label due to logistical constraints early in the pandemic; no placebo infusion was used. Sarilumab was administered intravenously at a fixed dose of 400 mg on day 1, with a second 400 mg IV dose on day 3 recommended if oxygen requirement had not decreased by more than 50%, at the discretion of the treating physician. Usual care (e.g., antibiotics, antivirals, corticosteroids, anticoagulants, vasopressors) followed local practice without protocol-mandated regimens. Some patients in the usual care group later received other IL-6R inhibitors (tocilizumab or sarilumab) or corticosteroids.\n\nThe trial used a Bayesian adaptive design with prespecified interim analyses. Two co-primary endpoints were defined, aligned with WHO-recommended core outcomes: (1) the proportion of patients with WHO-CPS score >5 (i.e., requiring non-invasive or mechanical ventilation, or worse) at day 4, analysed as a binary outcome via Bayesian methods; and (2) time to first occurrence of non-invasive ventilation (including high-flow oxygen), mechanical ventilation, or death up to day 14, analysed as a Bayesian time-to-event outcome. Efficacy decision rules were based on posterior probabilities for absolute risk difference (day 4) and hazard ratio (day 14), including thresholds for any benefit and for moderate or greater benefit, while futility was defined by a low posterior probability of moderate benefit.\n\nSecondary outcomes included WHO-CPS scores at days 7 and 14 (analysed with proportional odds models), overall survival up to day 90, time to hospital discharge, time to independence from oxygen, and safety endpoints (adverse events, serious adverse events, and causes of death). Inflammatory and laboratory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, D-dimer, ferritin, and liver enzymes were also monitored.\n\nBetween March 27 and April 6, 2020, 148 patients were randomised (68 to sarilumab and 80 to usual care); four usual care patients later withdrew consent and were excluded from analysis. Baseline characteristics, including age (median ~62 years), sex distribution (about three quarters male), oxygen flow (median 5–6 L/min), comorbidities (chronic cardiac disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, pulmonary disease), and inflammatory markers (e.g., median CRP ~155–160 mg/L), were generally balanced between groups.\n\nFor the day 4 primary endpoint, 26% of patients in both arms had WHO-CPS >5 (18/68 in the sarilumab group vs 20/76 in usual care), yielding a median posterior absolute risk difference of 0.2% (90% credible interval −11.7 to 12.2) and a posterior probability of any benefit (risk difference <0) of 48.9%. For the day 14 co-primary endpoint, 37% of sarilumab-treated patients and 34% of usual care patients experienced non-invasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation, or death (posterior median hazard ratio 1.10; 90% credible interval 0.69–1.74). The posterior probability of any beneficial effect (HR <1) was 37.4%, and the probability of a moderate or greater benefit (HR <0.85) was 18.6%, indicating no convincing efficacy signal.\n\nSecondary analyses showed no significant differences in clinical status at days 7 and 14 by WHO-CPS, or in time to discharge or oxygen independence by day 28. By day 90, mortality was 15% (10/68) in the sarilumab arm and 21% (16/76) in the usual care arm (adjusted hazard ratio for death 0.70; 95% CI 0.31–1.58), a non-significant difference. Sarilumab induced a rapid decline in CRP and neutrophil counts, consistent with IL-6 pathway inhibition, but this biological effect did not translate into a clear clinical benefit. Post-hoc subgroup analysis according to baseline CRP level (>150 mg/L) did not reveal a subgroup with evident benefit.\n\nSafety data indicated that overall adverse events were somewhat more frequent numerically with sarilumab (77 events in 37 patients) than with usual care (58 events in 33 patients), leading to a higher incidence rate per 1000 patient-days, though the number of patients experiencing at least one event did not differ significantly. Serious adverse events occurred in 40% of sarilumab patients and 37% of usual care patients. Bacterial sepsis was the most common serious adverse event in both arms. Neutropenia, a known effect of IL-6R blockade, occurred only in sarilumab-treated patients. Overall, serious adverse events and causes of death were similar between groups, without new major safety concerns.\n\nThe investigators interpret these findings as indicating that, in adults with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring oxygen but not ventilatory support and treated largely without routine corticosteroids early in the pandemic, sarilumab at 400 mg IV (with an optional second dose) did not improve early clinical outcomes or clearly improve survival compared with usual care. The study’s limitations include its modest sample size, open-label design, variability in concomitant treatments (notably infrequent dexamethasone use), and restriction to a specific disease severity (WHO-CPS 5). The results are discussed in the context of other trials and meta-analyses of IL-6 receptor inhibitors (sarilumab and tocilizumab), including evidence suggesting possible synergy with corticosteroids and variable efficacy across severity strata.\n\nOverall, this trial suggests that sarilumab does not meaningfully reduce the need for non-invasive or mechanical ventilation or death in this targeted population of patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia, while leaving open the possibility that different dosing, timing, or combination with corticosteroids might have different effects. Further larger, adequately powered trials and pooled analyses are recommended to more definitively assess the role of sarilumab and other IL-6R antagonists in COVID-19."
