      "briefSummary": "This was a phase 2, randomized, open-label, multicenter proof‑of‑concept trial evaluating whether the antiviral drug favipiravir, added to standard of care, can safely speed up clearance of SARS‑CoV‑2 in adults hospitalized with PCR‑confirmed COVID‑19. Patients were randomized to receive either favipiravir plus standard care or standard care alone, and the main outcome was how long it took for their respiratory samples to become PCR‑negative for the virus. The study also explored effects on clinical recovery, need for respiratory support, and safety.",
      "detailedDescription": "This phase 2, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial (NCT04358549) was conducted at 7 US academic medical centers from April through October 2020 to assess the safety and antiviral activity of favipiravir in adults hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). Eligible participants were 18–80 years old, hospitalized with a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal PCR‑positive test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) within 72 hours of hospitalization and within 7 days of their first positive PCR (later restricted to symptom onset within 10 days). Patients were randomized within 72 hours of hospitalization to receive either favipiravir plus standard of care (SOC) or SOC alone, and were stratified by disease severity (critical, severe, or mild to moderate).\n\nFavipiravir, an oral nucleoside analog with broad‑spectrum activity against RNA viruses and licensed in Japan for refractory influenza, was dosed at 1800 mg twice daily on day 1, followed by 1000 mg twice daily for 13 days (800 mg twice daily in patients with Child‑Pugh A liver disease). Treatment was planned for 14 days and continued after discharge, with a total follow‑up of 46 days after the active treatment phase. Concomitant use of other antivirals, immunomodulators, and most systemic steroids was initially excluded, though dexamethasone 6 mg daily was permitted after publication of the RECOVERY trial.\n\nThe primary endpoint was time to viral clearance by day 29, defined as time from randomization to the first SARS‑CoV‑2 PCR result that was negative or below the lower limit of quantification, without subsequent positives, based on scheduled nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. Key secondary endpoints included clinical recovery assessed by a study‑specific 6‑point ordinal scale, time to clinical recovery (normalization of fever, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and improvement of cough), changes in National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2), need for supplemental oxygen or ventilatory support, all‑cause mortality, duration of hospitalization, time to defervescence, changes in SARS‑CoV‑2 viral load (including time to RT‑PCR negativity and area under the viral load curve), requirement for mechanical ventilation, C‑reactive protein over time, and a population pharmacokinetic analysis of favipiravir and its metabolite.\n\nFifty patients were enrolled (25 per arm). Baseline characteristics differed slightly: the SOC group was older with more patients ≥65 years, while the favipiravir group had more severe illness at entry, including critical disease and greater need for noninvasive ventilation. Nineteen patients were censored from the primary endpoint because they were PCR‑negative at the research lab on day 1, remained PCR‑positive at day 29, or were lost to follow‑up (including some censored at day 29 due to clinical worsening).\n\nAmong the 50 randomized patients (intention‑to‑treat analysis), the median time to viral clearance was 16.0 days (90% CI, 12.0–29.0) in the favipiravir group versus 30.0 days (90% CI, 12.0–31.0) in the SOC group, with a statistically significant difference by log‑rank test (P = .0415), indicating enhanced viral clearance with favipiravir. Clinical outcomes, including time to clinical recovery, NEWS2 improvement, and duration of hospitalization, did not show significant differences between groups, though trends included a numerically shorter time to NEWS2 ≤2 or discharge with favipiravir and a longer mean hospitalization driven largely by one favipiravir‑treated patient with multiple comorbidities and a prolonged complicated hospital stay.\n\nSafety analyses showed that favipiravir was generally well tolerated. Treatment‑emergent adverse events occurred with similar frequency in both arms. The most common events with favipiravir were elevated gamma‑glutamyltransferase and acute kidney injury; in the SOC group, increases in inflammatory markers and respiratory failure were more frequent. There were more serious adverse events in the SOC arm numerically, but the single death occurred in a favipiravir‑treated patient after discharge due to a cerebral bleed judged unrelated to study drug or COVID‑19.\n\nPharmacokinetic data demonstrated that oral favipiravir achieved and maintained plasma concentrations above the in vitro EC50 for SARS‑CoV‑2 throughout the 14‑day course, with mean postdose levels ranging from approximately 22 to 42 µg/mL and substantial exposure (AUC0–24h) on days 1, 8, and 14. Levels of the metabolite T‑705 M1 were also quantified.\n\nPost hoc analyses explored factors influencing antiviral response. In patients who were neutralizing antibody‑negative (at or below the assay lower limit of quantification) at baseline, favipiravir was associated with a more pronounced acceleration of viral clearance compared with SOC, whereas no clear benefit was observed in those who already had higher neutralizing antibody titers at randomization. Similarly, when patients were stratified by time from symptom onset to randomization, an apparent antiviral benefit of favipiravir was seen primarily among those treated within 7 days of symptom onset; patients randomized after 8 or more days showed no clear advantage.\n\nOverall, this proof‑of‑concept trial demonstrates that favipiravir can be safely administered to hospitalized adults with COVID‑19 and can shorten the duration of SARS‑CoV‑2 RNA shedding as measured by PCR, particularly when given before substantial antibody development and earlier in the disease course. The findings support further evaluation of favipiravir, especially as an early oral treatment or prophylactic option for individuals at high risk of severe COVID‑19, including potential use in outpatient or post‑exposure settings."
