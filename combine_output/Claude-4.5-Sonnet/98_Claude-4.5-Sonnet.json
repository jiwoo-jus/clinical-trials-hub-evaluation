      "briefSummary": "CAPTIVATE (NCT02910583) is a randomized phase II study evaluating minimal residual disease (MRD)-guided treatment discontinuation following completion of first-line ibrutinib plus venetoclax treatment in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Previously untreated CLL patients age < 70 years received three cycles of ibrutinib lead-in followed by 12 cycles of combined ibrutinib plus venetoclax. Patients in the MRD cohort who met stringent criteria for confirmed undetectable MRD (Confirmed uMRD) were randomly assigned 1:1 to double-blind placebo or ibrutinib; patients without Confirmed uMRD (uMRD Not Confirmed) were randomly assigned 1:1 to open-label ibrutinib or ibrutinib plus venetoclax. The primary end point was 1-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate with placebo versus ibrutinib in the Confirmed uMRD population.",
      "detailedDescription": "This multicenter, international, randomized, phase II study was conducted at 35 sites and comprised two cohorts: the MRD cohort and a separate fixed-duration cohort. Eligible patients were age ≥ 18 to < 70 years with previously untreated CLL or SLL requiring treatment per iwCLL criteria and had measurable nodal disease by computed tomography, ECOG performance status 0-1, and adequate hepatic, renal, and hematologic function. During the prerandomization phase, patients received single-agent oral ibrutinib (420 mg once daily) lead-in for three cycles followed by ibrutinib plus oral venetoclax (target dose 400 mg once daily after standard 5-week ramp-up) for 12 cycles. Each cycle was 28 days. TLS risk categories were assessed at baseline and before venetoclax initiation, with hospitalization indicated for high-risk patients during the first 24-48 hours of venetoclax treatment. After completing 15 cycles of treatment, patients were randomly assigned according to MRD status (stratified by IGHV mutation status). Patients with Confirmed uMRD (defined as < 1 CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes, serially over ≥ 2 assessments ≥ 3 months apart, and in both peripheral blood and bone marrow) were randomly assigned 1:1 to double-blind placebo or ibrutinib until confirmed MRD relapse or disease progression. Patients with uMRD Not Confirmed were randomly assigned 1:1 to open-label ibrutinib or continued ibrutinib plus venetoclax (maximum 2 years overall duration for venetoclax) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Secondary end points included uMRD rates in peripheral blood and bone marrow, overall response rate per investigator assessment using 2008 iwCLL criteria, complete response rate, duration of response, TLS risk category reduction, progression-free survival, overall survival, pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib and venetoclax in combination, and safety and tolerability."
