      "briefSummary": "This study evaluates whether a transitional bridge clinic improves outcomes for hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) who are starting medication for OUD (MOUD). Patients are randomly assigned to either receive referral to a co-located, multidisciplinary bridge clinic or to usual care with community referrals. The primary outcome is hospital length of stay. Secondary outcomes include quality of life, linkage to ongoing care, medication fills, relapse rates, readmission rates, and costs of care.",
      "detailedDescription": "The BRIDGE (Bridging Recovery Initiative Despite Gaps in Entry) trial is a single-center, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial at Vanderbilt University Hospital. It addresses the challenge of caring for hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder (OUD), who have longer hospital stays and higher readmission rates compared to other patient populations.\n\nPatients admitted to the hospital with OUD who are being considered for medication for OUD (MOUD) in consultation with the addiction consult service are eligible. Exclusion criteria include severe psychiatric disorders requiring higher levels of care, preference for methadone maintenance, prior randomization in the study, and residence outside Middle Tennessee.\n\nRandomization occurs via REDCap after eligibility screening by the addiction consult service social worker. The randomization ratio is 1:1, adjusted bi-weekly based on clinic capacity. Patients are randomized to either referral to the bridge clinic or usual care with community MOUD provider referrals.\n\nThe bridge clinic operates all day Friday and provides comprehensive, wraparound services including addiction psychiatry, internal medicine, infectious diseases, pain management, social work, case management, and recovery coaching. The clinic offers low-threshold, rapid access care with weekly visits for the first 8 weeks, then twice monthly, with the goal of transitioning patients to long-term care within 3 months. Services include MOUD prescribing, urine drug testing, management of co-occurring conditions, and psychosocial support. Uninsured patients receive grant-funded medications and have charges written off by the institution.\n\nUsual care involves referrals coordinated by the primary medical team's social worker to community MOUD providers, with continuation of MOUD initiated by the addiction consult service during hospitalization.\n\nThe primary outcome is hospital length of stay. Secondary outcomes include linkage to MOUD provider, self-reported medication fills, readmission rates, emergency department visits, hospital-free and ED-free days, recurrent opioid use, quality of life (measured by Schwartz Outcome Scale-10 and EQ-5D-5L), overdose, mortality, and cost of care. For patients with infections suitable for outpatient management, additional outcomes include infection recurrence, antibiotic therapy completion, and time from negative blood culture to discharge.\n\nData are collected from the electronic health record and through 16-week follow-up phone calls conducted as part of routine care. Implementation measures include acceptance rates and reasons for ineligibility. The study began November 25, 2019, with anticipated completion in 18 months. Analysis will use an intent-to-treat approach with generalized linear models adjusted for covariates. The revised target sample size is 336 patients (168 per arm) based on interim review of length of stay data."
