      "briefSummary": "This study investigated whether twice-daily chlorhexidine oral rinses could reduce oral and lung bacteria and improve respiratory symptoms in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Participants with COPD and chronic productive cough or recent exacerbations were randomly assigned to use either chlorhexidine or placebo mouth rinses for 2 months. The study measured changes in bacterial biomass in the mouth and lungs, bacterial diversity, inflammatory markers, and quality of life. While chlorhexidine did not significantly reduce bacterial biomass, it decreased bacterial diversity in both the mouth and lungs and improved respiratory health-related quality of life compared to placebo.",
      "detailedDescription": "The ChLorhexidine effect In the oral and lung MicroBiota study (CLIMB) was a randomized, blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group preliminary study conducted at a single Veterans Affairs medical center. The study enrolled 44 participants aged 40-85 years with COPD and chronic productive cough or COPD exacerbation within the last year. Participants were excluded if they had used antibiotics in the previous 2 months or had fewer than four teeth.\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either 15 mL of twice-daily 0.12% chlorhexidine oral rinses or matched placebo for 8 weeks. At baseline and final visits, participants completed the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), provided blood samples, oral rinse samples, and induced sputum samples. Daily diaries using the Breathlessness, Cough and Sputum Scale (BCSS) were maintained throughout the study.\n\nThe primary outcome was change in oral and sputum microbiota biomass assessed by 16S rRNA quantification. Secondary outcomes included microbiota alpha diversity (Shannon and Simpson indices), taxonomic composition, inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, white blood cell count), BCSS scores, and SGRQ scores.\n\nForty participants completed the study (20 per group). Results showed that chlorhexidine did not significantly decrease microbiota biomass in either oral or sputum samples compared to placebo. However, chlorhexidine significantly decreased alpha diversity in both oral and sputum microbiota. Chlorhexidine use did not significantly affect systemic inflammatory markers or daily respiratory symptoms (BCSS), but did significantly improve respiratory health-related quality of life as measured by SGRQ (mean improvement of 4.7 points, which exceeds the minimum clinically important difference of 4 points).\n\nExploratory taxonomic analyses revealed that chlorhexidine use was associated with decreased abundance of Corynebacterium in sputum and Lachnoanaerobaculum in oral samples. The intervention was well-tolerated with few adverse events. The study suggests that chlorhexidine oral rinses may improve quality of life in symptomatic COPD patients, though the mechanisms require further investigation in larger clinical trials."
