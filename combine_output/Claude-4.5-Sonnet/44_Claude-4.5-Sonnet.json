      "briefSummary": "Medication adherence for patients with chronic conditions such as gout, a debilitating form of arthritis that requires daily medication to prevent flares, is a costly problem. Existing interventions to improve medication adherence have only been moderately effective. Habit formation theory is a promising strategy to improve adherence. The cue-reward-repetition principle posits that habits are formed by repeatedly completing an activity after the same cue and having the action rewarded every time. Over time, cues become increasingly important whereas rewards become less salient because the action becomes automatic. This study tests whether leveraging the cue-reward-repetition principle could improve adherence to daily gout medications.",
      "detailedDescription": "This is a three-arm parallel randomised controlled trial testing an adaptive intervention that leverages the repetition cue-reward principle. The trial began recruitment in August 2021 in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. Eligible patients are adults with gout who have been prescribed a daily oral medication for gout and whose most recent uric acid is above 6 mg/dL. Participants will be randomised to one of three arms and given electronic pill bottles. In the two intervention arms, participants will select a daily activity to link to their medication-taking (cue) and a charity to which money will be donated every time they take their medication (reward). Participants in Arm 1 will receive reminder texts about their cue and their charity reward amount will be $0.50 per day of medication taken. Arm 2 will be adaptive; participants will receive $0.25 per adherent-day and no reminder texts. If their adherence is <75% 6 weeks post-randomisation, their reward will increase to $0.50 per adherent-day and they will receive reminder texts. The control arm (Arm 3) will receive electronic pill bottles only without any intervention. The primary outcome is adherence to gout medications over 18 weeks. Secondary outcomes include habit formation through change in automaticity and sense of routine from baseline, as well as possible changes in intention or perceptions of gout medications. Exploratory outcomes include change in uric acid level from baseline."
