      "briefSummary": "This study evaluated the prognostic significance of detectable circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) BRAF V600E/K mutations in patients with advanced melanoma enrolled in a clinical trial without BRAF-targeted therapy. The hypothesis was that detectable cfDNA BRAF mutations may correlate with clinical outcomes, including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), in patients with stage IV melanoma. The study analyzed stored plasma samples and archived tissue from 149 patients to determine BRAF mutation status and assess its relationship to prognosis.",
      "detailedDescription": "NCCTG (North Central Cancer Treatment Group) N0879 was a randomized phase 2 clinical trial evaluating patients with unresectable stage IV melanoma treated with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab with or without everolimus. The trial enrolled 149 patients between May 5, 2010 and May 2, 2014. BRAF V600E/K mutation status was determined on archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue and pretreatment stored frozen plasma samples. Tissue DNA was analyzed using a clinical 50-gene hotspot PCR-based next-generation sequencing panel. Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) was extracted from plasma and analyzed for BRAF V600E/K mutations using a validated digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) assay. Results were reported as the presence or absence of cfDNA BRAF V600E/K detection compared to tissue. The study assessed progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients with and without detectable BRAF mutations in cfDNA. Of 63 patients with both tissue and blood samples available, 20 (31.7%) had tissue-diagnosed mutant BRAF, and of these, 11 (55.0%) had detectable plasma cfDNA BRAF. The assay demonstrated sensitivity of 55%, specificity of 97.7%, positive predictive value of 91.7%, and negative predictive value of 82.4%. Among patients with tissue-mutant BRAF V600E/K, PFS and OS were shorter for those with corresponding cfDNA mutations (PFS: 5.8 vs 12.0 months, P=0.051; OS: 9.2 vs 27.1 months, P=0.054). Multivariate analysis showed that elevated LDH levels at baseline were associated with increased risk for disease progression and death. The study concluded that detectable cfDNA BRAF V600E/K mutation appears to confer a poorer prognosis when detectable and may serve as a tool to risk-stratify patients with metastatic melanoma in practice or clinical trials."
