      "briefSummary": "This was a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, multicenter study to evaluate the Emprint™ ablation system for percutaneous microwave ablation in patients with metastatic or primary lung tumors. Subjects scheduled for resection of lung nodules underwent preoperative percutaneous microwave ablation. The primary objective was to evaluate the technical performance of the Emprint™ system in predicting the size of ablation zones by comparing predicted ablation zones (as prescribed by the investigational system software) versus actual ablation zones measured via CT imaging immediately following ablation and before surgical resection. The secondary endpoint was complete ablation defined as 100% non-viable tumor cells based on NADH staining. Safety endpoints included type, incidence, and severity of adverse events.",
      "detailedDescription": "This prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, multicenter study (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02323854) was conducted by Medtronic from January 2015 to March 2017 to evaluate the Emprint™ ablation system via a percutaneous approach in patients with metastatic or primary lung tumors. Fifteen patients (mean age 58.9 years; 67% male; 33% female) were enrolled, with 33.3% having previous thoracic surgery, 73% with metastatic tumors, and 27% with primary lung tumors.\n\nThe Emprint™ Procedure Planning Application, a commercially available software (Medtronic, Boulder, CO, USA), was used as an adjunct to assist with planning for the ablation procedure. The software utilizes pre-procedural CT images to visualize predicted ablation zones based on time, energy, and target tissue type. The predicted ablation zone displayed in the software is derived from lung-specific in vivo data collected in porcine models during product development.\n\nAll subjects underwent percutaneous microwave ablation using a single placed probe followed by surgical resection the same day. CT imaging was performed immediately after ablation with the antenna still in position. Time from antenna placement to removal was 23.7±13.1 minutes (median: 21.0; range: 6.0 to 48.0). CT assessment of the ablation was based on ground glass opacity and reviewed by a minimum of three board-certified radiologists in a blinded manner.\n\nThe primary endpoint was dose response, assessed by comparing predicted ablation zone size (from the Emprint™ procedure planning application) versus actual ablation zone size (observed on immediate post-ablation CT). Measurements included ablation zone width (X), height (Y), depth (Z), volume, and shape. The secondary endpoint was complete ablation for each target tumor, defined as 100% non-viable tumor cells on NADH viability staining. Histology was evaluated at a single center (National Jewish Health, Denver, CO, USA) by blinded pathologists. Safety endpoints included type, incidence, and severity of adverse events.\n\nResults showed that ablation zone volume was overestimated by the software in all patients. The percent difference in ablation zone volume (actual vs. predicted) was -63.5±26.3% (median: -67.3%; range: -94.9% to -5.5%). Complete ablation was detected in 54.5% (6/11) of subjects, incomplete ablation in 36.4% (4/11), and delayed necrosis in 9.1% (1/11). There were no device-related adverse events. Twenty-one adverse events were reported for 11 subjects, with 5 serious adverse events occurring in 3 subjects (20%), all either not related or unlikely to be related to the ablation procedure.\n\nThe study concluded that histologically complete ablation was observed in 55% of subjects. CT scanning less than an hour after ablation and tissue shrinkage (which can be as high as 75% by volume in lung tissue) may account for the smaller zone of ablation observed compared to that predicted by the investigational system software. The study confirmed the viability of an ablate and resect approach in the study of percutaneous ablation, but highlighted the need for future studies to account for tissue shrinkage when evaluating the accuracy of pre-procedure planning software."
