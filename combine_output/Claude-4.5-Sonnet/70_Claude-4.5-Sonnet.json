      "briefSummary": "This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of secukinumab 150 mg compared with placebo in the management of spinal pain and disease activity in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) at Week 8 and up to Week 24. Patients with active axSpA were randomized to receive secukinumab 150 mg or placebo. At Week 8, patients on secukinumab who achieved an average spinal pain score less than 4 were defined as responders and continued on secukinumab 150 mg, whereas non-responders were re-randomized to secukinumab 150 mg or 300 mg. Patients on placebo were re-randomized to receive secukinumab 150 mg or 300 mg. The primary objective was to assess the superiority of secukinumab 150 mg to placebo in achieving an average spinal pain score of less than 4 at Week 8.",
      "detailedDescription": "SKIPPAIN is the first randomized controlled study to evaluate spinal pain as the primary endpoint in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) as early as Week 8. This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study consisted of two treatment periods: a double-blind, placebo-controlled period from baseline to Week 8 (Treatment Period 1) and a double-blind secukinumab treatment period from Week 8 to Week 24 (Treatment Period 2). A total of 380 eligible patients (male and female aged 18 years or older) with active axSpA, classified as non-radiographic (nr-axSpA) or radiographic (r-axSpA, also termed ankylosing spondylitis) according to the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) criteria, were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either secukinumab 150 mg (Group A, n=285) or placebo (Group B, n=95). Patients had active spinal disease defined by a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score of 4 or higher and an average spinal pain score greater than 4. Patients should have had an inadequate response to at least two NSAIDs at the highest recommended dose for a minimum of 4 weeks. At Week 8, patients from Group A who achieved an average spinal pain score less than 4 (responders) were re-assigned to continue secukinumab 150 mg (Arm A1), whereas non-responders were re-randomized to receive secukinumab 150 mg (Arm A2) or 300 mg (Arm A3). Patients from Group B were re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to secukinumab 150 mg (Arm B1) or 300 mg (Arm B2). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving an average spinal pain score less than 4 on a 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS) at Week 8. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients achieving a BASDAI score less than 4 at Week 8. Exploratory endpoints included the proportion of patients achieving spinal pain score less than 4 at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 24, BASDAI score less than 4 at Week 24, Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) less than 2.1 and less than 1.3 at Weeks 8 and 24, and mean change from baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) score and ASAS Health Index (ASAS-HI) at Weeks 8 and 24. Safety was assessed by adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse events of special interest throughout the study."
