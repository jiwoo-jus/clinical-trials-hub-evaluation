      "briefSummary": "This pilot trial evaluated the role of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) in both healthy subjects and patients with chronic venous disease. The hypothesis was that repeated NMES use would enhance venous haemodynamic parameters, improve clinician disease scores, and increase patient-reported quality of life. Forty subjects were recruited from four groups: healthy, superficial insufficiency, deep insufficiency, and deep obstruction. Devices were worn for 4-6 hours per day, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks. Haemodynamic measurements were taken at baseline and week 6, and quality of life questionnaires were administered at weeks 0, 6, and 8.",
      "detailedDescription": "Neuromuscular stimulation (NMES) has been shown to improve peripheral blood flow in healthy people. This study investigated the effect of bilateral leg NMES on the symptoms of chronic venous disease. Forty subjects were recruited from four groups: healthy (n=10), superficial venous insufficiency (n=10), deep venous insufficiency (n=10), and deep venous obstruction (n=10). The NMES device used was the geko™ T-1, applied transcutaneously to the common peroneal nerve at the knee, causing intermittent electrical pulses (27mA, 1 Hz) that produce contractions of the anterior and lateral compartments of the leg.\n\nHaemodynamic venous measurements were taken from the right femoral vein using ultrasound, measuring peak velocity (PV), time averaged mean velocity (TAMV), and volume flow (VF). Laser Doppler fluximetry was performed on the left hand and foot. Leg volume was calculated using ankle and maximal calf diameters. All measurements were taken at baseline and repeated at week 6.\n\nDevices were worn bilaterally for 4-6 hours per day, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks. After week 6, NMES was discontinued. Quality of life assessments (Venous Clinical Severity Score, Venous Disability Score, Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire, EuroQol-5D, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Short Form-12) were performed at weeks 0, 6, and 8.\n\nResults showed that NMES increased femoral vein peak velocity by 55%, TAMV by 20%, and volume flow by 36% at 20 minutes (all p<0.05), which was enhanced at week 6 (PV and TAMV p<0.05). Mean increases in arm and leg fluximetry were 71% and 194% (both p<0.01). Leg swelling was reduced by mean 252.7 mL (13%, p<0.05) overall and 338.9 mL (16%, p<0.05) in venous disease. For those with venous pathology, scores for disease-specific and generic quality of life questionnaires improved. Those with C4-6 disease benefitted the most, with improvements in VDS score of 1, AVVQ of 6, and SF-12 of 10."
