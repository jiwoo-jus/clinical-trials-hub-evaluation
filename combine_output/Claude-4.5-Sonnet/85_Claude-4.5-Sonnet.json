      "briefSummary": "This two-stage, double-blind, phase II/III study evaluated three formulations of JTA-004, an enhanced protein solution containing clonidine, hyaluronic acid, and human plasma, for treatment of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. The study aimed to select the most effective formulation among the three (differing in clonidine concentration and injection volume) and compare its safety and efficacy with a reference treatment (hylan G-F 20) over 6 months. 164 patients aged 50-79 years with primary knee osteoarthritis were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive one of three JTA-004 formulations or the reference treatment. Patients were evaluated using WOMAC Scores and SF-12 health surveys at baseline and up to 6 months post-injection. The study hypothesis was that JTA-004 would provide superior pain relief and functional improvement compared to the reference treatment by restoring joint homeostasis through the interaction between human plasma and hyaluronic acid, and providing short-term analgesia through clonidine.",
      "detailedDescription": "This was a two-stage, prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled phase II/III study conducted in 12 Belgian centers from March 2016 to April 2018. The study enrolled 50-79-year-old patients with primary knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade II or III) who had insufficient response to analgesics/NSAIDs, pain ≥40 mm on VAS, morning stiffness ≤30 min, and BMI <35.\n\nPatients were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive a single intra-articular injection of one of three JTA-004 formulations or reference treatment (hylan G-F 20). The three JTA-004 formulations contained: JTA-100/2 (100 μg clonidine, 20 mg HA in 2 ml), JTA-200/2 (200 μg clonidine, 20 mg HA in 2 ml), or JTA-200/4 (200 μg clonidine, 40 mg HA in 4 ml). All formulations contained plasma protein solution at 1.02 g/ml.\n\nThe study included an interim analysis at 3 months (116 patients) to select the most effective JTA-004 formulation, with an Independent Data Monitoring Committee reviewing unblinded safety and efficacy data. The primary endpoint in the second stage was to demonstrate superiority of the selected formulation over reference at 6 months using WOMAC Pain Subscale Score.\n\nEfficacy was assessed using WOMAC VA3.1 Osteoarthritis Scores (Pain, Stiffness, Physical Function subscales) and SF-12 Well-Being scores at injection day, 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Safety endpoints included adverse events, serious adverse events, laboratory results, and physical examination findings throughout the study duration. Drug consumption (analgesics/NSAIDs) was also monitored.\n\nStatistical analyses used ANCOVA adjusted for baseline values and Mixed-effect Model for Repeated Measurements. The study originally planned 41 patients per group (164 total) but was underpowered based on interim analysis showing larger variability than anticipated (observed SD 25-30 mm vs. expected 10.5 mm). The IDMC recommended increasing to 76 patients per group, but this was not implemented.\n\nResults showed that 147 of 164 treated patients completed the study. JTA-200/2 was selected at interim analysis. At 6 months, the difference in adjusted mean change in WOMAC Pain Subscale Score between JTA-200/2 and reference was -9.49 mm (95% CI: -22.21, 3.23; p=0.141), not meeting the superiority criterion. However, post-hoc analyses of pooled JTA-004 data showed statistically significant improvements versus reference at Month 3 (p=0.014) and Month 6 (p=0.030). All JTA-004 formulations showed clinically acceptable safety profiles, with fewer treatment-related events in JTA-100/2 group."
