      "briefSummary": "This is a multicentre, pragmatic, controlled trial cluster-randomised at the clinician level to evaluate a multicomponent intervention for the management of uncontrolled hypertension in chronic kidney disease patients in primary care. The intervention consists of a clinical decision support system based on behavioural economic and user-centred design principles that will: (1) synthesise existing laboratory tests, medication orders and vital sign data; (2) increase recognition of chronic kidney disease, (3) increase recognition of uncontrolled hypertension in chronic kidney disease patients and (4) deliver evidence-based chronic kidney disease and hypertension management recommendations. The primary endpoint is the change in mean systolic blood pressure between baseline and 6 months compared across arms.",
      "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to incorporate behavioural economic principles and user-centred design principles into a multicomponent intervention for the management of uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) in primary care. This is a multicentre, pragmatic, controlled trial cluster-randomised at the clinician level at The Brigham and Women's Practice-Based Research Network of 15 practices. Of 220 total clinicians, 184 were eligible to be enrolled, and the remainder were excluded (residents and clinicians who see urgent care or walk-in patients); no clinicians opted out.\n\nThe intervention consists of a clinical decision support system based in behavioural economic and user-centred design principles that will: (1) synthesise existing laboratory tests, medication orders and vital sign data; (2) increase recognition of CKD, (3) increase recognition of uncontrolled HTN in CKD patients and (4) deliver evidence-based CKD and HTN management recommendations. The intervention includes Epic Best Practices Advisories (BPAs) utilizing computable phenotypes to identify five patient phenotypes related to CKD and uncontrolled blood pressure, with specific recommendations for ACE inhibitor or ARB prescribing, dose optimization, or diuretic addition. The CDS displays patient-specific data explaining why it fired, includes hyperlinks to clinical guidelines, and incorporates a precommitment email asking PCPs to pledge to follow blood pressure management recommendations.\n\nThe primary endpoint is the change in mean systolic blood pressure between baseline and 6 months compared across arms. Secondary endpoints include HTN-specific process measures, process measures for CKD quality of care, adverse drug events and hypotension. The study will use the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to evaluate reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the intervention.\n\nPatients over age 18 with CKD (defined as two prior eGFRs 16-59 mL/min/1.73 m2 separated by 90 days or two prior UACR >30 mg/g separated by 90 days) and uncontrolled HTN (at least one SBP >140 mm Hg within 2 years preceding enrollment and SBP >140 mm Hg at enrollment visit) will be eligible. The study will enroll patients over 12 months with 6-month follow-up."
