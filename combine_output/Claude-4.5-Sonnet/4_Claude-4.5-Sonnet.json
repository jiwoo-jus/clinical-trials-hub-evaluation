      "briefSummary": "The MYTHIC (Multicenter Study to Transplant Hepatitis C-Infected Kidneys) study was a multicenter trial evaluating kidney transplantation from hepatitis C virus (HCV) viremic donors into HCV-negative recipients, followed by 8 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P) treatment initiated 2 to 5 days post-transplant. The study aimed to assess the probability of receiving a kidney transplant compared to matched waitlist comparators, and to evaluate 1-year safety outcomes, allograft function, and survival. The hypothesis was that opting-in to receive kidneys from HCV-viremic donors would increase the probability of transplantation with excellent outcomes when followed by early direct-acting antiviral therapy.",
      "detailedDescription": "The MYTHIC trial was an open-label, multicenter (7 sites) clinical trial that enrolled 63 patients who were candidates for kidney transplantation. Of these, 30 patients underwent HCV donor-RNA-positive/recipient-negative kidney transplantation and received 8 weeks of oral glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P) initiated between days 2 and 5 post-transplant. The remaining patients either received transplants from HCV antibody-positive/RNA-negative donors, received standard-of-care transplants, or remained on the waitlist.\n\nThe study included patients aged 21 to 65 years who were on dialysis or had an estimated glomerular filtration rate <15 ml/min per 1.73 m². Exclusion criteria included positive test results for HIV, hepatitis B virus, known liver disease, or liver stiffness >8 kPa by Fibroscan. Donors had a kidney donor profile index (KDPI) at allocation ≤85%.\n\nThe primary outcome was HCV cure, defined as undetectable plasma HCV RNA 12 weeks after completion of G/P (sustained virologic response at 12 weeks). The 1-year analyses compared the probability of transplant for the 63 MYTHIC participants versus 2055 matched comparators from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) registry who did not opt-in to receive kidneys from HCV-viremic donors. Additional outcomes included 1-year post-transplant safety events, liver function, BK virus and cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia and clinical disease, allograft rejection, allograft function, HCV RNA levels, HCV antibody status, and survival.\n\nResults showed that the 1-year cumulative incidence of kidney transplantation was approximately 3.5-fold greater for the MYTHIC cohort versus matched UNOS comparators (68% vs. 19%, P<0.0001). All 30 HCV donor-RNA-positive/recipient-negative transplant recipients achieved HCV cure with no clinically significant liver disease or HCV-related kidney injury. One-year survival was 93% and graft function was excellent (median creatinine 1.17 mg/dl). However, there were 4 cases of CMV disease among 10 CMV-negative patients who received kidneys from HCV-viremic/CMV-positive donors. The study demonstrated that opting-in for HCV-viremic kidney transplant offers can increase the probability of transplantation with excellent 1-year outcomes in carefully selected patients when direct-acting antivirals are initiated early post-transplant."
