      "briefSummary": "This was a phase 1, randomized, double-blind (sponsor open), first-in-human study evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of GSK3358699 in healthy male participants. GSK3358699 is a mononuclear myeloid-targeted bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family inhibitor designed to preferentially deliver a pharmacologically active acid metabolite (GSK3206944) to cells expressing human carboxyesterase-1 (CES-1), including monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. The study aimed to determine if GSK3358699 could mitigate the dose-limiting toxicities (thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal symptoms, QTc prolongation) observed with pan-BET inhibitors while maintaining immunomodulatory effects.",
      "detailedDescription": "The study comprised multiple parts. Part A (N=23) included three dose-escalating periods (1-40 mg GSK3358699 or placebo) in two interlocking cohorts using a single ascending-dose crossover design. Each participant received a maximum of two single doses of GSK3358699 and one dose of placebo. Part C (N=25) was designed as an initial dose of 10 mg GSK3358699 or placebo daily for 14 days in four sequential cohorts. Part B (food effect evaluation) was not conducted.\n\nThe study evaluated systemic and intracellular pharmacokinetics of GSK3358699 and its metabolite GSK3206944, with blood samples collected at multiple timepoints for plasma and monocyte analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Pharmacodynamic assessments included ex vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated whole blood to measure inhibition of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production. Safety assessments included adverse event monitoring, clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, vital signs, cardiac telemetry, and 12-lead ECGs.\n\nResults showed that single doses of GSK3358699 were generally well tolerated up to 40 mg. Exposure to GSK3358699 and GSK3206944 increased with increasing doses, though the increase in AUC was greater than dose-proportional. The median initial half-life ranged from 0.7-1.1 hours (GSK3358699) and 2.1-2.9 hours (GSK3206944). Intracellular GSK3206944 concentrations in monocytes were quantifiable at 1-hour post-dose following 10 mg GSK3358699 and at 1 and 4 hours following 20-40 mg doses. Mean predicted percentage inhibition of ex vivo LPS-induced MCP-1 reached 75% with 40 mg GSK3358699, but GSK3358699 did not inhibit IL-6 or TNF. The most common adverse event was headache. However, four adverse events of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) were observed across parts A and C, and one serious adverse event of atrial fibrillation (part C) required hospitalization. Following a comprehensive benefit-risk assessment including emerging preclinical cardiac toxicity data from 3-month cynomolgus monkey studies (troponin elevations with cardiac histopathology), a causal relationship could not be excluded for cardiac-related adverse events. This resulted in an inability to identify a suitable repeat-dose regimen and termination of the study during cohort 5 of part C."
