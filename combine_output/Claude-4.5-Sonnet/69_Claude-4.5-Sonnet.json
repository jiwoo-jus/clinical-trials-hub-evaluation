      "briefSummary": "Intimate partner violence (IPV) disproportionately affects immigrant women, an understudied and underserved population in need for evidence-based rigorously evaluated culturally competent interventions that can effectively address their health and safety needs. This study uses a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design to rigorously evaluate an adaptive, trauma-informed, culturally tailored technology-delivered intervention tailored to the needs of immigrant women who have experienced IPV. In the first stage randomization, participants are randomly assigned to an online safety decision and planning intervention (culturally adapted myPlan) or a usual care control arm and safety, mental health and empowerment outcomes are assessed at 3-, 6- and 12-months post-baseline. For the second stage randomization, women who do not report significant improvements in safety (i.e., reduction in IPV) and empowerment from baseline to 3 months follow up (i.e., non-responders) are re-randomized to safety and empowerment strategies delivered via text only or a combination of text and phone calls with trained advocates. Data on outcomes (safety, mental health, and empowerment) for early non-responders is assessed at 6 and 12 months post re-randomization. The study hypothesizes that immigrant women who receive the intervention will show greater improvements in safety, mental health, and empowerment outcomes compared to those receiving usual care, and that adding text messaging and phone interventions will improve outcomes among non-responders.",
      "detailedDescription": "The weWomen Plus intervention is an adaptive technology-based trauma-informed culturally tailored intervention designed to reduce the risk of future IPV or homicide, improve mental health and increase empowerment of immigrant women in abusive relationships. The intervention consists of three components: (1) an online/web-based safety decision and planning tool (culturally adapted myPlan app), (2) text messaging intervention, and (3) phone call intervention.\n\nThe culturally adapted myPlan app is delivered through a free and secure web-based application. It is based on Dutton's empowerment model to facilitate protection, decision-making, and healing from negative health and social effects of IPV. The app includes an on-boarding section on safe technology use, privacy information, and secure password creation. Users receive an initial safety plan with general strategies, then complete additional sections to tailor the plan to their specific situation. This includes identifying \"red flags\" of unhealthy relationships, completing the Danger Assessment (DA) validated for immigrant women which categorizes danger levels, and a priority-setting activity considering needs and values. An evidence-based algorithm combines user inputs to create a tailored safety plan with links to local and national resources.\n\nThe text messaging intervention is based on a strengths-based empowerment framework and psychosocial readiness model. Tailored weekly messages are sent once a week for 4 weeks at preferred safe days and times. Week 1 assesses current feelings of safety, readiness for safety actions, past use of safety strategies and barriers, and provides information on safety plan elements and resources. Week 2 assesses current safety feelings, formal and informal support resources, helpfulness of prior suggestions, need for additional resources, and provides self-care tips. Week 3 assesses danger level using self-perception and potentially the short form DA, identifies safety risks of greatest concern, and provides safety plan messages, self-care strategies, and service referrals. Week 4 focuses on safety goals regardless of relationship status and provides additional community resources. All text sessions use empathetic tone, enhance self-worth, emphasize self-care, and end with emergency resources and safety reminders.\n\nThe phone intervention uses trauma-informed empowerment-focused approaches including strengths-based perspective, motivational enhancement, and solution-focused techniques. Two phone calls occur 1 week apart after the text intervention ends. The first call establishes trust, discusses primary concerns, emphasizes accomplishments, reframes negative thoughts to strengths, uses scaling questions to build motivation, elicits change talks, identifies modifiable changes within women's control, and develops mutually identified attainable goals reflecting women's priorities. The second call discusses steps taken towards goals, barriers, exceptions, general and culturally specific strengths, personal and community resources, and reinforces goals and strategies. Safety assessment is part of both sessions.\n\nThe study uses a SMART design with two stages of randomization. First stage: women are randomized to receive the online/web-based culturally adapted myPlan intervention or usual care control. Responders (those showing reduced violence severity/frequency or improved empowerment at 3 months) continue in their originally assigned arms. Second stage: non-responders (those not showing both reduced IPV and improved empowerment at 3 months) from both intervention and control arms are re-randomized to receive either text messaging alone or a combination of text messaging and phone intervention.\n\nOutcome measures include: Primary outcomes - (1) Severity and frequency of IPV measured by adapted Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2) with subscales for physical aggression, injury, psychological aggression, and sexual coercion; (2) Empowerment measured by Personal Progress Scale-Revised (PPS-R) for overall empowerment and Measure of Victim Empowerment Related to Safety (MOVERS) for safety-specific empowerment. Secondary outcomes include depression measured by Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and PTSD measured by Harvard Trauma Questionnaire. Outcomes are assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months post-baseline.\n\nThe control condition receives usual safety planning resources modeled on national and state domestic violence online resources without the DA or DA-informed tailored safety planning, but with standard safety planning information based on formative work identifying additional risk factors for immigrant women.\n\nRecruitment occurs nationally through immigrant-specific service providers, health clinics, IPV support agencies, listservs, and social media platforms. Eligibility criteria include: age 18-64 years; identify as woman; been in intimate relationship in past 12 months; experienced IPV (physical, sexual or psychological) in past 12 months; foreign-born immigrant living in US; access to safe computer or smartphone; willing to be contacted by phone or text. Data collection occurs through web-based or smartphone application-based questionnaire using Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS).\n\nThe study has robust retention procedures including compensation ($40 per survey, total $160), automated email reminders, monthly check-ins between assessments, and collection of alternate safe contacts. Safety protocols include comprehensive training for all team members, secure data management with code numbers and separate storage of identifiers, use of username/password/pin for accessing surveys, safety instructions for technology use, preferred method and timing for contacts, periodic safety check-ins, established suicide protocol, adverse event reporting to DSMB and IRB, and protection of data privacy through SSL encryption and restricted access. A Data Safety Monitoring Board comprised of three independent experts monitors safety and adherence to protocols at 6-month intervals."
