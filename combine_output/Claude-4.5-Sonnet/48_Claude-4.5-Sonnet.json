      "briefSummary": "This feasibility study assessed whether a randomized trial of blood pressure intervention in the preoperative clinic is feasible. The study enrolled 100 adults with elevated blood pressure during their preadmission visit and randomized them 1:1 to receive either brief blood pressure counseling with an educational brochure or the same counseling plus a home blood pressure monitor with mailed reports of home readings. At 60 days post-surgery, investigators followed up to determine primary care follow-up rates, changes in hypertension treatment, and patient satisfaction with the study interventions. The study found that interventional blood pressure trials in the preoperative clinic are feasible, though telephone follow-up led to significant gaps in outcome ascertainment.",
      "detailedDescription": "This prospective randomized feasibility study was performed at Yale New Haven Hospital Preadmission Testing Clinic between November 2018 and November 2019. A sample of 100 adults with elevated blood pressure (≥140 mmHg systolic or ≥90 mmHg diastolic) were recruited during their preadmission visit and randomized 1:1, stratified by gender. The counseling group received brief counseling about hypertension, a follow-up letter, and an educational brochure from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) group received the same educational materials at enrollment plus a validated Omron MX3 BP742 home blood pressure monitor with instructions to conduct resting measurements morning and evening until surgery. HBPM participants received a summary report of their mean home blood pressure readings by mail. At 60 days post-surgery, investigators attempted telephone follow-up to assess primary care follow-up, changes in hypertension treatment, and participant satisfaction. For participants not reached by phone after three attempts, electronic health records were reviewed. Primary outcomes included feasibility metrics such as completion of HBPM, ability to reach participants for follow-up, rates of primary care follow-up, and changes in hypertension management. Secondary outcomes included participant acceptance and satisfaction with the interventions. The study found that 94% of HBPM devices were returned, 78% of participants with returned monitors had elevated home blood pressure, and approximately 72% of participants had primary care follow-up within 60 days. However, telephone follow-up was successful in only 61% of participants, suggesting that future trials may benefit from greater reliance on electronic health record follow-up."
