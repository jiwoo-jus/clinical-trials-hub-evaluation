      "briefSummary": "The number of youth living with HIV in the United States continues to rise, and racial, ethnic, and sexual minority youth including young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and young transgender women (YTGW) bear a disproportionate burden of the HIV epidemic. Due to social and healthcare system factors, many YMSM and YTGW do not seek HIV testing services and are therefore less likely to be aware that they are infected. Mobile health technology (mHealth) has the ability to increase uptake of HIV testing among these populations. This study evaluates the mLab App, which combines HIV prevention information with a mobile phone imaging feature for interpreting at-home HIV test results, to improve testing rates and linkage to care among Black, Latino, and other YMSM and YTGW living in New York City and Chicago and their surrounding areas.",
      "detailedDescription": "This is a three-arm randomized controlled trial among YMSM and YTGW aged 18–29 years. Participants are randomized to either: (1) the mLab App intervention including HIV home test kits and standard of preventive care (Arm 1), (2) standard of preventive care only (Arm 2), or (3) HIV home test kits and standard of preventive care only (Arm 3). The mLab App is an FDA regulated investigational device (IDE #18348) that provides automated notification reminders to complete HIV testing every 3 months and includes an automated image processing feature where users can upload a photo of their completed OraQuick test to receive real-time test results. The app also contains an automated data collection and results reporting feature, which relays test results back to the research team and the study participant, triggering messages to encourage future repeat testing for those who receive a non-reactive test or linkage to confirmatory testing and treatment for those with a reactive test. The targeted enrollment is 525 participants (210, 210, and 105 in arms 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Participants complete study assessments at baseline as well as 6- and 12-month follow-ups via computer-assisted self-interviewing. The primary outcome is the proportion of participants who self-report being tested for HIV in the past 6 months. Secondary outcomes include linkage to care for those who test positive and validation of the automated image-processing algorithm against user self-report, study team assessment, and confirmatory testing results. mHealth technology used for HIV prevention is capable of delivering interventions in real-time, which creates an opportunity to remotely reach users across the country to strengthen their HIV care continuum engagement and treatment outcomes. Specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic, mHealth technology combined with at-home testing may prove to be essential in increasing HIV testing rates, especially among populations at high-risk or without regular access to HIV testing."
