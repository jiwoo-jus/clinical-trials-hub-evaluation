      "briefSummary": "Chronic pain is highly prevalent among veterans, with rates of opioid use higher than civilian populations. Increasing physical activity can reduce pain severity and decrease opioid use in patients with chronic pain. Behavioral economic strategies combining lottery incentives with loss aversion have been effective in promoting physical activity in non-veteran populations without chronic pain. This study evaluated whether a \"regret lottery\" - where veterans could win money if they met activity goals or were told what they would have won had they met their goals - would increase physical activity levels among veterans with chronic pain. The hypothesis was that this behavioral economic approach would motivate increased physical activity through immediate gratification and avoidance of regret.",
      "detailedDescription": "This was a 12-week single-blinded randomized controlled trial conducted at the Corporal Michael J. Crescenz VA Medical Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Forty veterans with chronic non-malignant pain receiving care from a pain-focused primary aligned care team (Pain PACT) were enrolled between July 2019 and January 2020. Participants were randomized 1:1 to either a control arm (activity trackers and daily text message reminders to increase physical activity) or an intervention arm (same as control plus a weekly regret lottery). The regret lottery provided participants who met weekly activity goals (either a 5% increase in steps over the previous week, or achieving and maintaining 150% of baseline steps) with a chance to win a small ($30; 18% chance) or large ($100; 1% chance) gift card incentive. Those who did not meet their goals were informed of what they would have won had they met their goal. The primary outcome was physical activity measured using Fitbit step counts and the Stanford 7-Day Physical Activity Recall Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes included pain-related physical function (Pain Outcomes Questionnaire), chronic pain severity, depression symptoms (PHQ-9), and opioid analgesic use extracted from electronic health records. All participants received $75 for complete study participation. Data were collected at baseline and at 12 weeks, with activity tracking occurring throughout the study period. The study utilized the Way to Health platform for enrollment, randomization, bi-directional text messaging, lottery administration, and integration of activity tracker data."
