      "briefSummary": "The transition from high school to college can exacerbate mental health problems in young adults yet barriers prevent seamless mental health care. This pilot randomized trial tested the acceptability and effects of an automated digital Mobile Support Tool for Mental Health (MoST-MH) for young adults transitioning to college. Youths aged 18 years and older with a current mental health diagnosis preparing to transition to college (n=52) were recruited from a primary care and a mental health clinic. Participants were randomized 2:1 to either receive MoST-MH (n=34) or enhanced Usual Care (eUC; n=18). MoST-MH included periodic text message and web-based check-ins of emotional health, stressors, negative impacts, and self-efficacy that informed tailored self-care support messages. Both groups received links to a library of psychoeducational videos and completed web-based assessments monthly for 3 months. The study hypothesized that youth would engage with MoST-MH at high rates and report high usability, and that MoST-MH would lead to greater mental health self-efficacy, lower symptom severity, and higher rates of follow-through with mental health care compared to eUC.",
      "detailedDescription": "Mental health disorders are common among young adults, with 20% of college students internationally and 31% of US college students meeting criteria for a mental health diagnosis. The transition from high school to college is a critical period where mental health support is lacking yet urgently needed, as new stresses related to academics, finances, and relationships can worsen mental health symptoms. Digital technology could assist young adults by providing rapid and efficient access to mental health support. To address existing barriers, the Mobile Support Tool for Mental Health (MoST-MH) was developed as an automated, transdiagnostic intervention designed to minimize burden using a stepwise algorithm that adapts frequency of interaction to the needs of the youth. MoST-MH is an ecological momentary intervention that provides support in the context of a young adult's current state and needs through periodic text message mental health check-ins, triggering web-based check-ins (when mental health was rated low) to understand stressors, negative effects, and self-efficacy, which informed self-efficacy support strategies drawn from positive psychology, cognitive behavioral therapy, and dialectical behavioral therapy, and prompted links to psychoeducational videos. This pilot randomized trial recruited youths aged 18 years and older with a current mental health diagnosis from one primary care (n=31) and one mental health clinic (n=21) in Pittsburgh, PA, from August to October 2020. Participants were randomized 2:1 to either receive MoST-MH (n=34) or enhanced Usual Care (eUC; n=18). The eUC participants received a web link to a library of the same psychoeducational videos provided to the MoST-MH group but no text message or web-based mental health check-ins. Both groups completed web-based versions of the Mental Health Self-Efficacy Scale (MHSES), College Counseling Center Assessment of Psychological Symptoms (CCAPS), and Client Service Receipt Inventory for Mental Health (C-SRI) monthly for 3 months and the Post-Study System Usability Scale (PSSUQ) at 3 months. Primary outcomes included engagement with MoST-MH, usability ratings, mental health self-efficacy, symptom severity, and mental health care services use. The study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic and was not powered to detect differences in outcomes between groups; therefore, further testing is needed."
