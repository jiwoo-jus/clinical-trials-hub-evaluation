      "briefSummary": "This study evaluated the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a sensor-controlled digital game (SCDG) called Heart Health Mountain for motivating heart failure (HF) self-management behaviors in older adults. The SCDG integrates data from wearable sensors (activity trackers and smart weighing scales) to trigger game rewards, progress, and feedback based on real-time weight monitoring and physical activity behaviors. In a randomized controlled trial, older adults with HF were assigned to either an intervention group (sensors plus SCDG app) or a control group (sensors only) and followed for 12 weeks of intervention and an additional 12 weeks of follow-up. The study assessed feasibility outcomes (recruitment, retention, engagement, satisfaction) and health outcomes (daily weight monitoring, physical activity, functional status, quality of life, HF knowledge, self-care behaviors, self-efficacy, motivation, and hospitalizations).",
      "detailedDescription": "Heart failure (HF) remains a leading cause of hospitalization among older adults, with poor self-management contributing to adverse health outcomes. Daily weight monitoring and physical activity are critical HF self-management behaviors that can prevent exacerbations and improve quality of life, yet adherence to these behaviors remains poor due to lack of motivation and knowledge.\n\nThis feasibility randomized controlled trial (1:1 allocation) compared an innovative sensor-controlled digital game (SCDG) intervention with a sensors-only control intervention. The SCDG, called Heart Health Mountain, was designed based on the Fogg Behavioral Model and synchronized with Bluetooth-enabled activity trackers and weighing scales to provide game-based motivation, education, rewards, and personalized feedback based on participants' real-time behaviors.\n\nEnglish-speaking adults aged 55 years or older with New York Heart Association class II or III HF who owned smartphones and could walk unassisted were recruited from Texas and Oklahoma between November 2019 and August 2020. Recruitment occurred both in-person (pre-COVID-19) at clinical sites and remotely (during COVID-19) via secure online methods and a recruitment company. All participants received Withings Go activity trackers, Withings Body smart weighing scales, and the Withings Health Mate app to record and transmit behavioral data. The intervention group additionally received the SCDG app on their smartphones, which included embedded HF education, game mechanics (narrative, rewards, challenges, feedback), and real-time behavioral triggers. The control group received the same HF education in written format but no gaming elements.\n\nThe 12-week intervention phase measured objective behaviors (daily weight monitoring and physical activity steps) via sensor data transmitted to a Google Cloud console. Feasibility outcomes included recruitment rates, retention at 12 and 24 weeks, intervention engagement (days of SCDG use), and satisfaction assessed via surveys and open-ended questions. Health outcomes were measured at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 weeks using validated instruments including the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (functional status and quality of life), Atlanta Heart Failure Knowledge Test, European Heart Failure Self-care Behavior Scale, Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (self-efficacy), Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire (motivation), and self-reported HF hospitalizations.\n\nA total of 38 participants enrolled (19 intervention, 19 control), with 31 (82%) completing the 12-week behavioral assessment and 27 (71%) completing the 24-week follow-up. Among intervention participants who installed the app (15/19, 79%), game engagement was strongly correlated with weight monitoring (r=0.72, p=0.04) and physical activity (r=0.9, p<0.001). Satisfaction surveys indicated the SCDG was easy to use, motivating, and educational. Trends of improvement were observed in the intervention group for daily weight monitoring (medium effect size of 0.53) and physical activity compared to control. Both groups showed within-group improvements in functional status, quality of life, HF knowledge, self-efficacy, and reductions in HF hospitalization, possibly reflecting benefits of digital health monitoring overall.\n\nThis feasibility study demonstrates that an SCDG intervention integrating real-time sensor data with game mechanics is feasible, acceptable, and shows promising trends for improving HF self-management behaviors in older adults. Findings support the development of a fully powered efficacy trial to validate the intervention's effectiveness in promoting sustained behavior change and improving health outcomes in this population."
