      "briefSummary": "This study is a pragmatic, investigator-blind, cluster randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a behavioral economics–electronic health record (BE-EHR) module intervention. The intervention leverages behavioral economics nudges integrated with electronic health record technology and clinical decision support tools to reduce overtreatment of type 2 diabetes in adults aged 76 years and older, in accordance with the American Geriatrics Society's Choosing Wisely guideline. A total of 66 New York University Langone Health clinics will be randomized 1:1 to receive either the 6-component BE-EHR module intervention plus standard care or standard care only for 18 months. The primary outcome is patient-level Choosing Wisely compliance, with secondary outcomes measuring intervention component activation rates and provider interaction with the BE-EHR module.",
      "detailedDescription": "This pragmatic, investigator-blind, cluster randomized controlled trial aims to test the effectiveness of a previously developed, iteratively refined, user-tested, and pilot-tested BE-EHR module for promoting appropriate diabetes care in elderly adults compared to usual care. The study will randomize 66 eligible New York University Langone Health (NYULH) primary care and endocrinology clinics across the greater New York City area and 2 sites in Florida to 1 of 2 groups: (1) BE-EHR module intervention plus standard care or (2) standard care only. Clinics will be stratified by practice size (measured by the number of eligible patients with encounters in 2019) and location (Manhattan/Brooklyn versus other locations). The study leverages NYULH's Epic electronic health record system for patient inclusion and intervention delivery. Eligible patients must be aged ≥76 years with type 2 diabetes as defined in the patient's problem list or encounter diagnosis within the EHR. Exclusion criteria include not taking diabetes medication, metformin allergy, and estimated glomerular filtration rate <30. Clinicians at intervention-arm clinics will receive the BE-EHR module components during eligible patient encounters or according to a monthly dissemination schedule. The 6-component BE-EHR module includes: (1) Tailored Advisory: a noninterruptive alert describing appropriate treatment guidelines based on life expectancy category; (2) Refill Protocol: an alert during medication refills suggesting metformin or dose adjustments; (3) Preference List: automatic default display of metformin at the top of diabetes medication lists; (4) Lab Result: an alert with treatment guidelines when new HbA1c results are available; (5) Peer Comparison: monthly emails with graphics comparing the clinician's Choosing Wisely compliance to their practice site and all NYULH practices; and (6) Campaign: monthly game show-themed animations and flashcards promoting Choosing Wisely awareness. Each component utilizes behavioral economics principles such as framing, social norming, suggesting alternatives, affirmation, emotional appeal, accountable justification, defaults, peer comparisons, and gamification. Patients are categorized into high, medium, or low life expectancy groups using an algorithm that incorporates age, gender, and comorbidity burden. Choosing Wisely compliance is determined by comparing HbA1c levels to target ranges appropriate for each life expectancy category. The primary outcome is patient-level Choosing Wisely compliance, measured using a 3-level logistic mixed-effects model accounting for patients nested within providers nested within clinics. Secondary outcomes include activation rates of intervention components, provider interaction with the module (clicks, workflow sequences), and email read receipts. The study commenced on December 7, 2020, and will run for 18 months, potentially extended if COVID-19 affects patient visit activity. This trial is the first pragmatic randomized controlled trial to use behavioral economics principles embedded within the EHR and delivered using clinical decision support tools to promote Choosing Wisely guideline adherence specifically in type 2 diabetes. The study will provide valuable information on clinician workflow and interaction with the BE-EHR module, guiding future research in optimizing the timely delivery of behavioral economics nudges within clinical decision support tools and addressing the effectiveness of BE-inspired interventions in diabetes and chronic disease management."
