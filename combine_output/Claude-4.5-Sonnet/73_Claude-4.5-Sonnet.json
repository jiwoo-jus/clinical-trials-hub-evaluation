      "briefSummary": "This study (ORIENT-4) aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of sintilimab, a humanized anti-PD-1 antibody, in patients with relapsed/refractory extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma (r/r ENKTL). ORIENT-4 is a multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 clinical trial. Patients with r/r ENKTL who failed at least one asparaginase-based regimen were enrolled to receive sintilimab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 24 months. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) based on Lugano 2014 criteria. Twenty-eight patients with r/r ENKTL were enrolled from August 31, 2017 to February 7, 2018. Twenty-one patients (75.0%, 95% CI: 55.1–89.3%) achieved an objective response. With a median follow-up of 30.4 months, the median overall survival (OS) was not reached. The 24-month OS rate was 78.6% (95% CI, 58.4–89.8%).",
      "detailedDescription": "Extranodal natural killer (NK)/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL) is a highly aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with high incidence in Asia and Latin America. Patients who failed asparaginase-based therapy have limited treatment options with a median survival of less than 6 months. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is an important etiological and prognostic factor for ENKTL. Overexpression of PD-L1 induced by EBV infection is a potential mechanism for ENKTL to avert immune surveillance. Sintilimab is a recombinant humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody that binds to human PD-1 with potentially greater affinity compared to pembrolizumab or nivolumab according to preclinical data. This prospective phase 2 study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sintilimab against r/r ENKTL. Eligible patients received sintilimab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until progressive disease, death, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of informed consent, up to 24 months. Treatment beyond progressive disease was allowed according to the investigator's discretion. The patients were evaluated for efficacy using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography at baseline and weeks 6, 15, and 24. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography was used at baseline and weeks 24, 36, and 48 and every 24 weeks thereafter. Efficacy was assessed according to the Lugano 2014 standard. The median age of the patients was 37 years (range: 19–65), and 17 (60.7%) were male. Patients received a median of 3 (Q1–Q3, 2.0–4.5) prior lines of chemotherapy, and all were relapsed or refractory to previous asparaginase-based treatment. Most treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were grade 1–2 (71.4%), and the most common TRAE was decreased lymphocyte count (42.9%). Serious adverse events occurred in 7 (25.0%) patients, and no patient died of adverse events. Sintilimab demonstrated effectiveness and was well tolerated in patients with r/r ENKTL and could be a novel therapeutic approach for the control of ENKTL in patients."
