      "briefSummary": "This phase 1/2 clinical trial (MM1636) evaluated the safety, immunogenicity, and clinical efficacy of a first-in-class immune-modulatory vaccine targeting indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in combination with nivolumab in patients with metastatic melanoma. The vaccine (IO102/IO103) consists of peptides derived from IDO and PD-L1, administered with Montanide adjuvant. The hypothesis is that activating IDO- and PD-L1-specific T cells through vaccination can target immunosuppressive cells and tumor cells expressing these molecules, thereby modulating the tumor microenvironment to enhance responsiveness to anti-PD-1 therapy. Thirty anti-PD-1 therapy-naive patients with metastatic melanoma were treated with the vaccine combined with nivolumab.",
      "detailedDescription": "The MM1636 trial is an investigator-initiated, nonrandomized, open-label, single-center phase 1/2 study conducted at the Department of Oncology, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Denmark. The study aimed to assess the feasibility, safety, immunogenicity, and clinical efficacy of the IDO/PD-L1 peptide vaccine (IO102/IO103) combined with nivolumab in patients with metastatic melanoma.\n\nThe vaccine consists of two peptides: IO102 (a 21-amino-acid peptide from IDO) and IO103 (a 19-amino-acid peptide from the signal peptide of PD-L1), each at 100 µg, mixed with Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant. The vaccine was administered subcutaneously biweekly for the first six doses, then every 4 weeks, for a maximum of 15 vaccinations over approximately 9 months. Nivolumab was administered intravenously at 3 mg/kg biweekly for 24 cycles, followed by 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks as standard of care for responding patients, for up to 2 years.\n\nThe primary objective was to evaluate safety and feasibility. Secondary objectives included assessment of immunogenicity through detection of vaccine-specific T cell responses in peripheral blood and tumor biopsies, and evaluation of clinical efficacy measured by objective response rate (ORR), complete response rate (CRR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.\n\nPatients eligible for enrollment were adults (≥18 years) with locally advanced or stage 4 melanoma (AJCC 7th edition), at least one measurable lesion, ECOG performance status 0-1, and no prior anti-PD-1 therapy. Main exclusion criteria included CNS metastases >1 cm, severe comorbidities, and active autoimmune disease.\n\nThe study enrolled 30 patients from December 2017 to June 2020. Blood samples for immunologic analyses were collected at baseline, during treatment (cycles 3, 6, 12, 18, 24), and 3 and 6 months post-vaccination. Tumor biopsies were obtained at baseline and after six cycles when accessible. Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin tests were performed after cycle 6 to evaluate skin-infiltrating lymphocytes reactive to the vaccine peptides.\n\nImmunogenicity was assessed using interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays, flow cytometry for intracellular cytokine staining, and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing. Functional characterization of vaccine-specific T cells included assessment of cytolytic markers (CD107a), cytokine production (IFN-γ, TNF-α), and recognition of target cells expressing IDO and/or PD-L1.\n\nClinical efficacy was evaluated using FDG PET-CT scans at baseline and every 3 months until progression. Responses were categorized according to RECIST 1.1 by investigator review and validated by blinded independent external review. To address potential trial bias, patients were matched with a historical control group from the Danish Metastatic Melanoma Database (DAMMED) who received anti-PD-1 monotherapy contemporaneously, matched for age, sex, PD-L1 status, BRAF status, LDH level, and M stage.\n\nTumor microenvironment changes were assessed through immunohistochemistry (IHC) of paired biopsies for CD3, CD8, PD-L1, IDO, MHC-I, and MHC-II expression, and RNA gene expression profiling using the NanoString nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel.\n\nThe study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice, monitored by the GCP unit in Copenhagen, and approved by the ethical committee of the Capital Region of Denmark, the Danish Medical Agencies, and the Capital Region of Denmark Data Unit. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03047928) and EudraCT (2016-0004527-23)."
