      "briefSummary": "Tobacco kills more than 8 million people each year, mostly in low- and middle-income countries. In Vietnam, 1 in every 2 male adults smokes tobacco. Vietnam has set up telephone Quitline counseling that is available to all smokers, but it is underused. The investigators previously developed an automated and effective motivational text messaging system to support smoking cessation among US smokers. The aim of this study is to adapt the aforementioned system for rural Vietnamese smokers to promote cessation of tobacco use, both directly and by increasing the use of telephone Quitline counseling services and nicotine replacement therapy. Moreover, the investigators seek to enhance research and health service capacity in Vietnam. The investigators hypothesize that participants in the intervention arm will have higher rates of cessation and higher smoking self-efficacy and that they will engage more frequently with the Quitline counseling and NRT services.",
      "detailedDescription": "The investigators are testing the effectiveness of a culturally adapted motivational text messaging system by using a community-based randomized controlled trial design (N=600). Participants were randomly allocated to the intervention (regular motivational and assessment text messages) or control condition (assessment text messages only) for a period of 6 months. Trial recruitment took place in four communes in the Hung Yen province in the Red River Delta region of Vietnam. Recruitment events were advertised to the local community, facilitated by community health workers, and occurred in the commune health center.\n\nThe intervention group received one-way motivational text messages (seven in the first week, two per week in weeks 2-26) to promote cessation and provide encouragement to access Quitline and free NRT. They also received weekly two-way assessment text messages asking how many times they had smoked tobacco in the past 24 hours and whether they would like to receive a call from the Quitline, which is then provided. The control group received twice-monthly two-way assessment text messages asking how many times they have smoked tobacco in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe investigators are assessing the impact of the texting system on 6-month self-reported and biochemically verified smoking cessation, as well as smoking self-efficacy, uptake of the Quitline, and use of nicotine replacement therapy. In addition to conducting the trial, the research team also provided ongoing training and consultation with the Quitline during the study period.\n\nBaseline data collection includes patient demographics, comorbidities, technology use, and Quitline use. Participants are asked about their level of readiness to quit, former quit attempts, and current smoking habits. Social support for quitting is measured using the shortened partner interaction questionnaire. Smoking cravings are assessed using the brief 10-item version of the Questionnaire of Smoking Urges. At baseline, the investigators also administer the 12-item Smoking Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (SEQ-12).\n\nThe primary outcome of the study is the tobacco cessation rate at 6-month follow-up. At the follow-up research visit, the research staff determines current smoking through self-report and verify with a carbon monoxide breath monitor. Patients who respond \"no\" to smoking are classified as nonsmokers if their carbon monoxide measurement is less than 10 ppm. Secondary outcomes are changes from the baseline in self-efficacy on the SEQ-12 and Quitline use."
