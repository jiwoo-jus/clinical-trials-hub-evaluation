      "briefSummary": "SPIRIT was a long-term safety study evaluating fevipiprant, an oral prostaglandin D2 receptor 2 (DP2 receptor) antagonist, in patients aged 12 years and older with inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe asthma. The study consisted of two treatment periods: a 52-week double-blind period followed by an optional 104-week single-blind period. Patients were randomized to receive fevipiprant 150 mg once daily, fevipiprant 450 mg once daily, or placebo, added to their standard of care asthma therapy. The primary objective was to assess the long-term safety profile of fevipiprant by evaluating time-to-first treatment emergent adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation. Exploratory efficacy endpoints included the rate of moderate-to-severe asthma exacerbations and changes in lung function (FEV1). The study enrolled both newly recruited patients and patients who had completed previous Phase 3 fevipiprant trials (LUSTER-1, LUSTER-2, ZEAL-1, ZEAL-2).",
      "detailedDescription": "The SPIRIT study (NCT03052517) was a two-treatment period, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentre, parallel-group Phase 3 trial designed to evaluate the long-term safety and exploratory efficacy of fevipiprant in patients with uncontrolled asthma. Fevipiprant is a non-steroidal, highly selective, reversible antagonist of the DP2 receptor that inhibits the binding of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and its metabolites, thereby reducing inflammatory cascade activation in asthma.\n\nThe study enrolled male and female patients aged 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe asthma (GINA steps 3, 4, and 5) who were receiving standard of care asthma therapy. Two patient cohorts were included: rollover patients who had completed one of four previous Phase 3 fevipiprant efficacy studies (LUSTER-1, LUSTER-2, ZEAL-1, ZEAL-2) on active treatment, and newly enrolled patients who had not previously participated in a fevipiprant study. New patients were required to have inadequately controlled asthma with ACQ score ≥1.5 and reduced lung function (FEV1 ≤85% predicted for patients ≥18 years, ≤90% for patients 12 to <18 years).\n\nPatients were randomized in an approximate 3:3:1 ratio to receive fevipiprant 150 mg once daily, fevipiprant 450 mg once daily, or placebo. Stratified block randomization was used based on previous study participation and treatment received. The study consisted of Treatment Period 1 (52 weeks, double-blind) followed by an optional Treatment Period 2 (104 weeks, single-blind). Due to negative results from the overall Phase 3 program, the study was terminated early by the Sponsor on December 16, 2019, and data from both treatment periods were combined for analysis.\n\nPrimary safety endpoints included time-to-first treatment emergent adverse event (AE), serious adverse event (SAE), and AE leading to discontinuation from study treatment, analyzed using Cox regression models stratified by randomization stratum with treatment group, asthma severity, and region as fixed factors. Exploratory efficacy endpoints included the rate of moderate-to-severe asthma exacerbations (analyzed by negative binomial regression) and change from baseline in pre-dose FEV1 (analyzed using mixed model for repeated measures). Subgroup analyses were performed for patients with blood eosinophil count ≥250 cells/μL at screening.\n\nA total of 2,538 patients were enrolled and randomized (1,093 to fevipiprant 150 mg, 1,085 to fevipiprant 450 mg, and 360 to placebo), including 1,807 rollover patients and 731 newly enrolled patients. At study termination, 1,184 patients had received at least 52 weeks of treatment and 163 patients had received at least 104 weeks of treatment. The study was conducted across multiple countries and sites globally."
