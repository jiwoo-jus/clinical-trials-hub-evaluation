      "briefSummary": "This double-blinded, phase 2 randomized, controlled trial compared the efficacy and safety of prophylactic high titer (≥1:320) SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma (CCP) with standard plasma for preventing infection in exposed, uninfected individuals. Asymptomatic participants aged ≥18 years with close contact exposure to a person with confirmed COVID-19 in the previous 120 hours and negative SARS-CoV-2 test within 24 hours before transfusion were eligible. The study hypothesized that CCP might prevent infection when administered before symptoms or laboratory evidence of infection. The primary outcome was development of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
      "detailedDescription": "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted at 19 United States centers from June 2020 to March 2021 to compare the safety and efficacy of transfusion of CCP (intervention) with SARS-CoV-2 non-immune control plasma. A total of 180 participants were enrolled; 87 were assigned to CCP and 93 to control plasma, and 170 were transfused. Two were excluded for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity at screening.\n\nEligible subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive 1 unit of CCP or 1 unit of control plasma. CCP donors had a history of positive molecular assay test for SARS-CoV-2 infection and had SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels ≥1:320 titer by Euroimmun ELISA at screening. Control was standard SARS-CoV-2 non-immune plasma collected before January 1, 2020, or seronegative for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe primary efficacy outcome was incident SARS-CoV-2 infection by study day 28 by positive RT-PCR testing. Individuals were followed for 90 days with visits at days 0 (transfusion), 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, 60, and 90. Nasal swabs were collected at screening and at days 1, 7, 14, and 28. Secondary efficacy outcomes included disease severity measured to day 28 using a clinical event scale and efficacy examined based on donor antibody titer. Safety assessments included serious adverse events and transfusion reactions.\n\nOf the 168 participants in the modified intention to treat analyses, 12/81 (14.8%) CCP and 13/87 (14.9%) control recipients developed SARS-CoV-2 infection; 6 (7.4%) CCP and 7 (8%) control recipients developed COVID-19 (infection with symptoms). There were no COVID-19-related hospitalizations in CCP and 2 in control recipients. There were 28 adverse events in CCP and 58 in control recipients. The restricted mean infection free time by 28 days for all SARS-CoV-2 infections (25.3 vs. 25.2 days; p=0.49) and COVID-19 (26.3 vs. 25.9 days; p=0.35) were similar for both groups. High titer CCP as post-exposure prophylaxis appeared safe, but did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection."
