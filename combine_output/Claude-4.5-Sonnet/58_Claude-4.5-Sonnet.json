      "briefSummary": "CASTING was a prospective, international, multicenter, single-arm, open-label phase 3b trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis who had a suboptimal response to one or two prior disease-modifying therapies. Patients received intravenous ocrelizumab 600 mg every 24 weeks for 96 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving no evidence of disease activity (NEDA), defined as absence of relapses, disability progression, and inflammatory MRI measures, with prespecified MRI re-baselining at Week 8. The study hypothesis was that switching to ocrelizumab would result in high NEDA rates in this population with prior treatment failure.",
      "detailedDescription": "CASTING (NCT02861014) was designed specifically for patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) with a suboptimal response to one or two prior disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). Eligibility criteria included age 18-55 years, EDSS score 0.0-4.0, disease duration <10 years from first symptom, and prior suboptimal response defined as one or more relapses, one or more T1-weighted contrast-enhancing lesions, or two or more new/enlarging T2-weighted hyperintense lesions on MRI while receiving a stable dose of DMT for at least 6 months. Patients could be enrolled based on MRI criteria only. The study enrolled 680 patients across 157 centers in 16 countries across Europe and Turkey from September 2016 to October 2019. Patients received ocrelizumab 600 mg intravenously every 24 weeks for 96 weeks (first dose administered as two 300-mg infusions, 14 days apart). The primary endpoint was no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) at Week 96, incorporating MRI re-baselining at Week 8 to exclude MRI activity occurring during the first 8 weeks before the potential treatment benefit of ocrelizumab is realized. NEDA was defined as absence of protocol-defined relapse, 24-week confirmed disability progression, contrast-enhancing lesions, and new/enlarging T2-weighted hyperintense lesions. Secondary endpoints included NEDA rates at 24 and 48 weeks, time to first event of disease activity, annualized relapse rate, MRI measures including lesion counts and volumes, and brain volume changes. Safety assessments included adverse events, serious adverse events, laboratory tests, and vital signs. The study incorporated subgroup analyses by demographics, disease characteristics, reason for enrollment, and prior DMT exposure."
