      "briefSummary": "This phase 2a, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigated the efficacy and safety of RIST4721 300 mg oral solution compared to placebo in adult subjects with moderate to severe palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP). PPP is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by sterile pustules on the palms and soles with significant neutrophilic infiltration. RIST4721 is a small molecule antagonist of CXCR2 (CXC chemokine receptor type 2), which plays a key role in neutrophil recruitment and migration to sites of inflammation. Eligible subjects had a PPPASI (Palmoplantar Pustulosis Area and Severity Index) score of 8 or higher and a PPPGA (Palmoplantar Pustulosis Physician Global Assessment) score of 3 or higher. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive either RIST4721 300 mg or placebo once daily for 28 days. The primary efficacy endpoints were the relative change from baseline in fresh and total pustule counts at day 28. Secondary endpoints included absolute changes in pustule counts and the proportion of subjects achieving at least a 50% reduction in pustule counts. Exploratory endpoints included PPPASI-50 response rates and plasma concentrations of RIST4721.",
      "detailedDescription": "Palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) is a rare, chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by sterile pustules with erythema, hyperkeratosis, scaling, pruritus, pain, and/or burning sensation on the palms and soles. The condition is debilitating and significantly impacts quality of life. PPP is commonly diagnosed in females between 40 and 69 years of age and in current or former smokers. The pathobiology of PPP involves neutrophil recruitment, potentially mediated by human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (hCAP-18) and its processed forms, which upregulate pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-8, IL-23, IL-17C, IL-1α, and IL-1β in keratinocytes. IL-8 is particularly implicated in neutrophil migration and activation. Currently, there are no approved treatments for PPP in the USA, Canada, or the European Union. Off-label treatments include topical corticosteroids, calcipotriene, phototherapy, and systemic therapies such as acitretin, cyclosporine, and biologic agents targeting IL-23 or IL-17, though these have limited efficacy and may cause significant side effects.\n\nRIST4721 is a potent CXCR2 antagonist with 134-fold and 47-fold greater selectivity for CXCR2 than CXCR1 and CCR2b, respectively. By blocking CXCR2 ligands including IL-8, RIST4721 prevents neutrophil migration to sites of inflammation without affecting neutrophil activation due to minimal activity on CXCR1. The on-target effect of RIST4721 results in a reduction of absolute neutrophil count (ANC), which is dose-dependent and reversible. Prior phase 1 studies demonstrated that RIST4721 is generally well tolerated with reversible reductions in ANC.\n\nThis phase 2a study enrolled 35 subjects with moderate to severe PPP at 17 sites across Canada (12 sites) and Germany (5 sites). Key eligibility criteria included age 18-70 years, at least a 6-month history of PPP, PPPASI ≥ 8, PPPGA ≥ 3 at day -1, and a minimum of 8 fresh pustules at screening and 20 fresh pustules at day -1. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to RIST4721 300 mg or placebo once daily for 28 days, with randomization stratified by consent to skin biopsy collection. The study duration included an up to 30-day screening period, 1 day for eligibility confirmation and randomization, a 28-day treatment period, and a 14-day follow-up period.\n\nEfficacy assessments included fresh and total pustule counts, PPPASI, PPPGA, Palmoplantar Pustulosis Severity Index (PPSI), pain visual analogue scale (VAS), and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at baseline and study visits. Blood samples for RIST4721 plasma concentrations were collected on days 7 and 21 from consenting subjects. Safety was assessed through physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms, clinical laboratory tests, and adverse event monitoring.\n\nThirty-four subjects received at least one dose of study drug (15 RIST4721, 19 placebo). The mean baseline fresh pustule count was 33.5 ± 17.99, and total pustule count was 92.8 ± 76.88. The majority of subjects (82.4%) were female, and 73.5% were current smokers. At day 28, the mean relative change from baseline in fresh pustule count was 0.86 ± 0.692 for RIST4721 and 0.53 ± 0.561 for placebo (P=0.240), and in total pustule count was 0.99 ± 0.667 and 0.96 ± 0.672, respectively (P=0.804). No statistically significant differences were observed for primary efficacy endpoints.\n\nRIST4721 was generally well tolerated, with TEAEs occurring in 86.7% of RIST4721-treated subjects (predominantly mild gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal disorders) compared to 36.8% in placebo. Mean ANC decreased from 4.041 ± 1.1703 10E9/l at baseline to 2.499 ± 0.9059 10E9/l at day 28 in the RIST4721 group but remained within the reference range. Two subjects experienced mild, transient, asymptomatic neutropenia that resolved without treatment discontinuation. No serious adverse events or deaths were reported.\n\nPost hoc analysis of subjects with progressing disease (defined as an increase in total pustule count between screening and baseline) demonstrated that 71% of RIST4721-treated subjects achieved PPPASI-50 at day 28 compared to 15% on placebo (P=0.022), suggesting potential efficacy in preventing or blocking PPP flares. These findings indicate that RIST4721 may be effective in patients with active, progressing disease. Further studies with longer treatment durations and standardized entry criteria are warranted to confirm these preliminary findings."
