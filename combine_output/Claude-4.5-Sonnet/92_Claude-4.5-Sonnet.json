      "briefSummary": "This phase 2 randomized controlled trial evaluated the safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of bepirovirsen, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA, in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). The study enrolled both treatment-naïve patients and those receiving stable nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) therapy. The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability, while the secondary objective was to evaluate antiviral activity, including changes in serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) concentration from baseline to day 29. Participants received bepirovirsen or placebo via subcutaneous injection twice weekly during weeks 1 and 2, and once weekly during weeks 3 and 4, followed by a 26-week follow-up period.",
      "detailedDescription": "Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection affects approximately 296 million people globally and leads to increased risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current treatments with nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) and pegylated interferons achieve low functional cure rates, defined as sustained loss of detectable serum HBsAg with undetectable HBV DNA. Bepirovirsen is an antisense oligonucleotide with a 2'-O-methoxyethyl gapmer design that targets all HBV messenger RNAs and pregenomic RNA, leading to reductions in HBV-derived RNAs, HBV DNA, and viral proteins including HBsAg in preclinical models.\n\nThis phase 2, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 31 patients with CHB from seven centers in Hong Kong and the Republic of Korea. Twenty-four patients were treatment-naïve and seven were receiving stable NA therapy. Patients were randomized 3:1 within each dose cohort to receive bepirovirsen (150 mg or 300 mg) or placebo. Treatment consisted of six subcutaneous injections administered twice weekly during weeks 1 and 2 (days 1, 4, 8, and 11) and once weekly during weeks 3 and 4 (days 15 and 22), followed by a 26-week follow-up period. After day 29 assessments, treatment-naïve patients initiated NA therapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or entecavir.\n\nThe study assessed safety endpoints including adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and concomitant medication usage. Efficacy endpoints included changes in plasma HBV DNA and serum HBsAg concentrations from baseline to day 29 and week 31, proportion of participants with HBsAg loss, and changes in serum HBeAg concentration in HBeAg-positive patients. Exploratory endpoints included seroconversion rates to anti-HBs or anti-HBe antibodies. Additional virological biomarkers including HBV RNA, hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg), and sequencing of the bepirovirsen binding site were assessed post hoc.\n\nResults demonstrated dose-dependent reductions in HBsAg and HBV DNA in treatment-naïve patients, with statistically significant reductions observed in the bepirovirsen 300 mg group compared to placebo. Four patients achieved HBsAg levels below the lower limit of quantitation. Treatment-emergent adverse events were mostly mild to moderate, with injection site reactions being most common. Transient, self-resolving alanine aminotransferase (ALT) flares were observed in eleven patients receiving bepirovirsen, temporally associated with HBsAg reductions. The study provides preliminary evidence supporting further investigation of bepirovirsen as a potential therapeutic option for achieving functional cure in patients with chronic hepatitis B."
