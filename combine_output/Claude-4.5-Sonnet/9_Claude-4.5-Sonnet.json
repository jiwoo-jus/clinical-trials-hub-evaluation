      "briefSummary": "Sexual and gender minority adolescents (SGMA) experience higher rates of mental health problems compared to their heterosexual and cisgender peers. Minority stress theory suggests that discrimination, violence, and victimization lead to chronic stress that contributes to these mental health disparities. This study tested a novel 10-session school-based intervention called Proud & Empowered (P&E) designed to help SGMA cope with minority stress. The intervention was developed through extensive research including the creation of a comprehensive minority stress measure for adolescents. A randomized controlled trial was conducted with four high schools, where schools were randomly assigned to either receive the P&E intervention or serve as controls. The study hypothesized that youth participating in P&E would report fewer minority stress experiences and improved mental health symptoms (depression, PTSD, anxiety, and suicidality) compared to control group youth. Results showed that the intervention reduced minority stress experiences and mental health symptoms, and moderated the relationship between minority stress and negative health outcomes.",
      "detailedDescription": "This randomized controlled trial evaluated the Proud & Empowered (P&E) intervention, a 10-session small group program for sexual and gender minority adolescents (SGMA) delivered in school settings. The intervention was developed following the NIH Intervention Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development and was based on the Sexual Minority Adolescent Stress Inventory (SMASI), which identifies 10 domains of minority stress: social marginalization, family rejection, internalized homonegativity, identity management, homonegative climate, intersectionality, negative disclosure experiences, religion, negative expectancies, and homonegative communication.\n\nThe study was conducted in fall 2019 with four public high schools in Southern California that collectively serve 5,706 students from diverse racial, ethnic, and income backgrounds. Schools were randomly assigned to intervention or control conditions. Youth in the intervention condition participated in weekly 45-minute P&E sessions during one class period, while control youth attended school as usual. Each session addressed a different domain of minority stress and included psychoeducation, didactic discussion, and interactive activities. Sessions covered: stress and coping, disclosure decision-making, family, school-related stress and resilience, peers and friendship, safety in relationships, spirituality/faith/religion, race/ethnicity/social justice, LGBT community and history, and intersections of health/substance use/HIV/medical system.\n\nSchool staff members (primarily counselors) received one-day training to co-facilitate the curriculum alongside the project coordinator. Fidelity monitoring was conducted after each session using adherence checklists. Participants completed measures at pretest (one week before the first session) and posttest (one week after the last session), assessing demographic characteristics, minority stress (SMASI), and mental health symptoms including anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory), depression (Beck Depression Inventory II), PTSD (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5), and suicidality (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale). The study received IRB approval and a waiver of parental consent to protect youth who may not be out to their parents. Forty-six students participated, with 44 completing both pre- and posttests (95.6% retention rate)."
