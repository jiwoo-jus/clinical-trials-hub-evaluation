      "briefSummary": "Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is an increasingly used and effective treatment for obesity; however, the rapid weight loss associated with SG adversely affects bone metabolism predisposing patients to skeletal fragility. Bisphosphonate medications have been evaluated for safety and efficacy in combating bone loss in patients with osteoporosis, but their use in SG-induced bone loss is limited. The goal of this study is to investigate how a one-time infusion of zoledronic acid compares to placebo, in its ability to combat SG-associated bone loss.",
      "detailedDescription": "This research protocol is a 9-month, pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 30 adult SG patients randomised to receive an infusion of either 5 mg of zoledronic acid or placebo, 6 weeks following surgery. To be included participants must be <350 lbs/158.8 kg, free of bone-impacting pathologies or medications, and must have adequate serum calcium and vitamin D levels at baseline. The primary outcome is change in areal bone mineral density (aBMD) at the total hip. Secondary outcomes include change in aBMD of the femoral neck, and lumbar spine, and change in volumetric BMD at the lumbar spine. The primary aim will be tested using a linear mixed model fit with total hip aBMD at 9 months as the outcome. Treatment, participant sex and menopausal status will be considered in analysis. Groups will be compared using contrast statements at 9 months, with change over 9 months being the primary comparison.\n\nThis pilot quadruple-blinded (participant, care provider, investigator and outcomes assessor are blinded to the treatment group) RCT anticipates 30 participants (15 per group) assigned (via computer-generated 1:1 block randomisation, with stratification by sex) to receive a one-time 100 mL infusion of 5 mg zoledronic acid or saline 6–8 weeks following SG. Study assessments will occur at baseline (prior to surgery) and at 9 months postoperatively.\n\nThe study includes comprehensive bone health measures including DXA scans (total body, hip, femoral neck, lumbar spine), QCT of the lumbar spine, bone turnover markers (P1NP and NTX), physical function testing (5 times sit to stand, hand grip strength, 4-metre walk test), and self-report surveys (HAP, KOOS, NOF calcium intake). All participants will receive calcium (1200 mg daily) and vitamin D supplementation (1000-2000 IU daily based on baseline levels) throughout the study duration. The infusion visit will take place 6-8 weeks following surgery after confirming adequate kidney function (eGFR ≥35 mL/min)."

However, premenopausal women with documented non-hormonal intrauterine devices in the study population will mitigate this risk. Although there is consensus that pregnancy should be avoided for 12–24 months following bariatric surgery, many women in this population regain fertility and become pregnant following surgery. Research has shown that hormonal contraceptives may not be as efficacious in women with obesity, and bariatric surgery has been shown to impact absorption and efficacy of oral contraception methods.
