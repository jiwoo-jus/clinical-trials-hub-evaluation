      "briefSummary": "This multicenter, single-arm study assessed the safety and effectiveness of an advanced hybrid closed-loop (AHCL) system with automated basal insulin delivery (Auto Basal) and automated bolus correction (Auto Correction) in 157 individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D), including 39 adolescents (aged 14-21 years) and 118 adults (aged 22-75 years). After a run-in period using sensor-augmented pump therapy with or without predictive low glucose management or Auto Basal for approximately 14 days, participants used the AHCL system for approximately 90 days with glucose targets of 100 or 120 mg/dL. The study evaluated safety events and changes in A1C, time in range (TIR, 70-180 mg/dL), and time below range (TBR, <70 mg/dL).",
      "detailedDescription": "This multicenter open-label single-arm trial enrolled adolescents (14-21 years) and adults (22-75 years) with type 1 diabetes to evaluate the MiniMed advanced hybrid closed-loop (AHCL) system. The study consisted of two phases: a baseline run-in period (Visits 1-4, approximately 14 days) and a study phase (Visits 5-18, approximately 90 days). During the run-in period, participants used sensor-augmented pump therapy with or without predictive low glucose management or automated basal insulin delivery (Auto Basal), but without automated bolus correction (Auto Correction). During the study phase, both Auto Basal and Auto Correction were enabled with glucose targets set at 100 or 120 mg/dL for approximately 45 days each. The AHCL system included the MiniMed 670G insulin pump (version 4.0 algorithm) with continuous glucose monitoring (Guardian Sensor [3] and Guardian Link [3] transmitter) and incorporated a meal detection module developed by DreaMed Diabetes. Primary endpoints included safety events and changes in A1C, time in range (TIR, 70-180 mg/dL), and time below range (TBR, <70 mg/dL) from the run-in period to the end of the study phase. Additional endpoints included sensor glucose metrics, coefficient of variation, time spent in hyperglycemic ranges (>180, 250, 300 mg/dL), time spent in hypoglycemic ranges (<50, 54, 70 mg/dL), total daily insulin dose, and basal and bolus insulin delivery. Analyses were performed on daytime (6 AM-12 AM) and nighttime (12 AM-6 AM) periods separately. Subgroup analyses examined the effects of glucose target settings, active insulin time (AIT) settings, and closed-loop exits. The intent-to-treat population included 157 participants who entered the study phase, with 152 completing the study. Over 20,229 days of system use during the study, the AHCL system demonstrated no device-related serious adverse events, no severe hypoglycemia, and no diabetic ketoacidosis during the study phase. Participants spent an average of 94.9% of time in closed loop with only 1.2 exits per week. Compared to the run-in period, A1C decreased from 7.5% to 7.0%, TIR increased from 68.8% to 74.5%, and TBR decreased from 3.3% to 2.3%. The 100 mg/dL glucose target and lower AIT setting (2 hours) further optimized glycemic outcomes without increasing hypoglycemia risk."
