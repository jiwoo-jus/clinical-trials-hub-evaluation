      "briefSummary": "This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate whether remdesivir prevents hospitalization in nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk for disease progression. Eligible patients had symptom onset within 7 days and at least one risk factor for disease progression (age ≥60 years, obesity, or certain coexisting medical conditions). Patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg on days 2 and 3) or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause by day 28. The study aimed to determine if early treatment with a 3-day course of remdesivir in outpatient settings would reduce hospitalizations and mortality in high-risk patients.",
      "detailedDescription": "Remdesivir is a direct-acting nucleotide prodrug inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase with potent nanomolar activity in primary human airway epithelial cells. Previous phase 3 trials showed that remdesivir shortened recovery time in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. This trial hypothesized that earlier initiation of a short course of remdesivir treatment in outpatient settings would reduce hospitalizations and mortality.\n\nThe trial enrolled 562 patients from September 18, 2020, through April 8, 2021, at 64 sites in the United States, Spain, Denmark, and the United Kingdom. Trial sites included outpatient infusion facilities and skilled nursing facilities, with some participants receiving infusions at home. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2 and 3) or placebo. Randomization was stratified according to residence in a skilled nursing facility (yes or no), age (<60 years or ≥60 years), and country (United States or outside the United States).\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause by day 28. The primary safety endpoint was any adverse event. Secondary endpoints included the composite of COVID-19-related medically attended visits or death from any cause by days 14 and 28, COVID-19-related hospitalization by days 14 and 28, time-weighted average change in nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load from baseline to day 7, and time to alleviation of baseline COVID-19 symptoms as measured by the FLU-PRO Plus questionnaire.\n\nAssessments included physical examinations, adverse event reporting, blood testing, and collection of nasopharyngeal swabs to quantify SARS-CoV-2 viral load using RT-PCR assay at prespecified intervals. The electronic COVID-19-adapted Influenza Patient-Reported Outcome (FLU-PRO) Plus questionnaire was used to assess patient-reported symptoms daily through day 14.\n\nThe trial was stopped early for administrative reasons related to decreased SARS-CoV-2 incidence, ethical concerns regarding placebo assignment with increased access to emergency-use-authorized treatments, and increasing vaccination rates among high-risk persons. Of the 1264 patients expected to enroll, 562 (44.5%) had undergone randomization and begun the trial regimen by the time enrollment was stopped."
