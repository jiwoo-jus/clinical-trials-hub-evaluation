      "briefSummary": "This phase I, open-label, dose-escalation clinical trial investigated the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of afatinib, an ErbB family blocker, when combined with radiotherapy (RT) with or without temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The study enrolled patients with histologically confirmed grade 4 malignant glioma and known O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter methylation status. The trial included two treatment regimens: regimen M (afatinib + TMZ + RT) for patients with methylated MGMT promoters, and regimen U (afatinib + RT) for patients with unmethylated MGMT promoters. The primary endpoint was to determine the MTD of continuous daily afatinib in combination with RT, with or without concomitant TMZ treatment.",
      "detailedDescription": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults and is associated with poor prognosis. Amplification or overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene occurs in approximately 40% and 60% of patients with GBM, respectively. Afatinib is an irreversible ErbB family blocker that targets EGFR (ErbB1), HER2 (ErbB2), and ErbB4, offering a broader inhibitory profile than first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and demonstrating potential for central nervous system penetration.\n\nThis phase I trial employed a 3+3 dose-escalation design at five sites in the United Kingdom. Eligible patients were aged ≥18 and <70 years with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed WHO grade 4 malignant glioma and known MGMT gene promoter methylation status. Patients received RT (2 Gy per fraction, 5 days per week for 6 weeks, total dose 60 Gy) in combination with afatinib at escalating doses (20, 30, or 40 mg/day) during the RT phase (days 1-42), followed by maintenance afatinib at 40 mg/day. In regimen M, patients also received TMZ 75 mg/m² daily during the RT phase, followed by up to six 28-day cycles of TMZ (150 mg/m² in cycle 1, 200 mg/m² in cycles 2-6, days 1-5 of each cycle).\n\nThe primary endpoint was MTD, defined as the highest afatinib dose at which no more than one of six patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the RT phase. Secondary endpoints included safety (assessed via adverse events graded by CTCAE v3.0), objective tumor response rate (evaluated by investigator assessment using Macdonald criteria via gadolinium-enhanced MRI), and afatinib pharmacokinetics. Post hoc analysis examined time to disease progression.\n\nFifty-five patients were enrolled; 36 received at least one dose of trial medication (regimen M, n=20; regimen U, n=16). The MTD was determined as afatinib 30 mg/day in combination with daily TMZ and RT (regimen M), and afatinib 40 mg/day in combination with RT alone (regimen U). The most frequently reported adverse events were diarrhea, rash, and nausea/fatigue, consistent with the known safety profile of afatinib. Of evaluable patients, five (25%) receiving regimen M and one (6%) receiving regimen U achieved an objective response. Median time to disease progression was 434 days (95% CI 205-NA) for regimen M and 211 days (95% CI 101-NA) for regimen U. Pharmacokinetic profiles were consistent with previous afatinib monotherapy studies. The study concluded that afatinib in combination with RT, with or without TMZ, has a manageable safety profile in patients with newly diagnosed GBM, and future studies should incorporate biomarker-based patient preselection, particularly for EGFR aberrations."
