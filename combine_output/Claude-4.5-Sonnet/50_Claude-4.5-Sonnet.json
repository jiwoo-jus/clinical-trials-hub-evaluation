      "briefSummary": "Cholera remains a major cause of infectious diarrhea globally, with an estimated 2.9 million cases and 95,000 deaths annually. This Phase 2a study tested iOWH032, a synthetic small molecule inhibitor of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel, as a potential antisecretory, host-directed therapeutic for cholera. Forty-seven healthy adult volunteers were experimentally infected with Vibrio cholerae El Tor Inaba strain N16961 in an inpatient setting and randomized to receive either 500 mg iOWH032 or placebo orally every 8 hours for 3 days. The study aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of iOWH032 in reducing cholera-induced diarrheal symptoms by blocking intestinal chloride and water secretion triggered by cholera toxin. This represents the first use of the cholera controlled human infection model to test a therapeutic candidate.",
      "detailedDescription": "Cholera is an acute secretory diarrheal disease caused by infection with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. The disease is mediated by cholera toxin, which activates the CFTR chloride channel in intestinal epithelial cells, leading to hypersecretion of chloride and water into the intestinal tract. This results in severe, potentially fatal dehydrating diarrhea if untreated. Current treatments include oral rehydration therapy and antibiotics such as doxycycline and azithromycin, but antibiotic resistance is an increasing threat. Host-directed antisecretory drugs represent an alternative therapeutic strategy.\n\niOWH032 is a synthetic small molecule CFTR inhibitor containing an oxadiazole-carboxamide core with a dibromo-hydroxyphenyl pharmacophore. In preclinical studies, it inhibited CFTR with an IC50 of approximately 5 μM (2,725 ng/mL), blocked cholera toxin-induced intestinal secretion by more than 90% in a mouse closed-loop model, and reduced cholera toxin-induced fecal output by nearly 70% in a cecectomized rat model. iOWH032 demonstrated an acceptable safety profile in toxicology studies and Phase 1 clinical trials.\n\nThis Phase 2a study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, group-sequential trial conducted in two cohorts. Participants were challenged with 10^6 colony-forming units of V. cholerae and then randomized 1:1 to receive iOWH032 or placebo, stratified by blood type (O versus non-O). Treatment started at diarrhea onset or 48 hours post-challenge, whichever came first. The primary efficacy endpoint was diarrheal stool output rate, defined as total volume of diarrheal stools divided by hours between study drug initiation and antibiotic therapy initiation. Secondary endpoints included diarrheal disease severity, time to first formed stool, number of loose stools, and microbiological parameters. All participants received a 3-day course of ciprofloxacin starting at day 4 post-challenge or earlier if meeting severe cholera criteria.\n\nThe study found that iOWH032 was generally safe and achieved mean plasma levels of 4,270 ng/mL (±2,170) after 3 days of dosing. However, the median diarrheal stool output rate for the iOWH032 group was 25.4 mL/hour (95% CI: 8.9, 58.3) compared to 32.6 mL/hour (95% CI: 15.8, 48.2) for placebo, a non-significant 23% reduction. No significant differences were observed in secondary endpoints including diarrhea severity, number of stools, time to first formed stool, or need for intravenous fluids. The study concluded that iOWH032 does not merit further development for cholera treatment, but provided important lessons for future therapeutic testing in the cholera controlled human infection model."
