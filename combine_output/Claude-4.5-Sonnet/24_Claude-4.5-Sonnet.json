      "briefSummary": "This study investigates the mechanisms by which copper depletion impacts metastasis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The orally bioavailable copper chelating agent tetrathiomolybdate (TM) has shown significant survival benefits in high-risk TNBC patients. Using two independent TNBC models, the researchers identified a discrete subpopulation of highly metastatic SOX2/OCT4+ cells within primary tumors that exhibit elevated intracellular copper levels and marked sensitivity to TM. Global proteomic and metabolomic profiling revealed that TM-mediated inactivation of mitochondrial Complex IV is the primary metabolic defect in the SOX2/OCT4+ cell population. The study also identifies the AMPK/mTORC1 energy sensor pathway as an important downstream mediator, and shows that AMPK inhibition rescues TM-mediated loss of invasion. Loss of the mitochondria-specific copper chaperone COX17 restricts copper deficiency to mitochondria and phenocopies TM-mediated alterations. These findings identify a copper-metabolism-metastasis axis with potential to enrich patient populations in next-generation therapeutic trials.",
      "detailedDescription": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by the absence of estrogen receptor (ER−), progesterone receptor (PR−), and HER2 overexpression (HER2−). TNBC accounts for 10-15% of all breast cancers and is associated with poor outcomes due to lack of response to current targeted therapies and higher rates of metastasis. Copper serves as a cofactor for metalloenzymes that contribute to malignant progression. The copper chelating agent tetrathiomolybdate (TM) has been associated with significant survival benefit in high-risk TNBC patients. A phase II clinical trial (NCT00195091) showed that TM was safe and well-tolerated, with event-free survival (EFS) of 72% and overall survival (OS) of 84% at median follow-up of 6.3 years. The TNBC cohort with stage 4 disease showed EFS of 69% after 2 years, a striking finding compared to median EFS and OS of less than 8 months and 12 months, respectively, in other trials.\n\nThis study uses in vivo lineage tracing of the metastatic compartment in primary breast tumors, together with proteomic and metabolomic profiling, to provide a direct link between copper-mediated metabolic reprogramming and metastasis in TNBC. Using the SOX2/OCT4-GFP promoter reporter system, the researchers lineage traced a subpopulation of SOX2+OCT4+ cancer cells within the primary tumor that exhibit stem cell phenotypes and enhanced potential for metastasis. These cells showed higher basal intracellular copper levels compared to reporter-negative cells and exhibited marked sensitivity to TM-mediated copper depletion.\n\nQuantitative protein abundance profiling using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) identified multiple subunits of mitochondrial Complex IV that were specifically downregulated after TM treatment in reporter-positive cells. Gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment of pathways involved in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). TM-mediated copper depletion led to degradation of Complex IV subunits and resulted in significant reduction (>60%) in oxidation of cytochrome c. Extracellular flux analysis showed that reporter-positive cells exhibited higher rates of oxygen consumption compared to reporter-negative cells, and TM treatment resulted in dramatic reduction in basal respiration and ATP-linked respiration in reporter-positive cells.\n\nTo confirm that mitochondrial copper depletion was responsible for the observed phenotypes, the researchers targeted COX17, a mitochondria-specific copper chaperone that transports copper to Complex IV. COX17 knockdown reduced oxygen consumption, ATP-linked respiration, invasion, and lung metastases, phenocopying TM-mediated alterations. TM-mediated reduction in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) decreased ATP production and triggered activation of the AMPK-mTORC1 pathway. AMPK inhibition rescued TM-mediated loss of invasion, demonstrating that AMPK is a downstream mediator of TM-mediated invasion defects.\n\nThese findings identify a copper-metabolism-metastasis axis and highlight its potential to be developed as a next-generation therapeutic approach for high-risk TNBC patients. The study provides mechanistic insights that may facilitate patient selection for future TM trials and advance TM into larger randomized phase II trials."
