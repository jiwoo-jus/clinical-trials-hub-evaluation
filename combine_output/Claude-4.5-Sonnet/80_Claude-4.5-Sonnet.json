      "briefSummary": "This was a phase Ib study investigating avelumab (an anti-PD-L1 antibody) in combination with other agents in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The study evaluated three combination regimens: avelumab with utomilumab and rituximab (arm A), avelumab with utomilumab and azacitidine (arm B), and avelumab with bendamustine and rituximab (arm C). The primary endpoints were dose-limiting toxicities and objective response rate. The study was designed to assess whether these combination therapies could augment and sustain the antitumor immunity of avelumab in relapsed/refractory DLBCL.",
      "detailedDescription": "JAVELIN DLBCL (NCT02951156) was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, seamless two-component (phase Ib planned to be followed by phase III), parallel-arm study of avelumab in various combinations for the treatment of relapsed/refractory DLBCL. Based on preclinical and clinical data suggesting potential synergy between PD-L1 inhibition and various immunomodulatory agents, three combination regimens were investigated. Arm A combined avelumab with utomilumab (an IgG2 4-1BB agonist) and rituximab, based on evidence that 4-1BB agonism and PD-L1 antagonism may be synergistic and that anti-4-1BB agonist mAbs can enhance rituximab's anti-lymphoma activity. Arm B combined avelumab with utomilumab and azacitidine, based on evidence that epigenetic priming by azacitidine might sensitize cancer cells to PD-1/PD-L1 axis blockade. Arm C combined avelumab with bendamustine and rituximab, given that bendamustine and rituximab is recommended for relapsed/refractory DLBCL. Key eligibility criteria included histologically confirmed DLBCL in patients at least 18 years of age with relapsed/refractory disease following two or more and up to four lines of rituximab-based multiagent chemotherapy. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to the three treatment arms. Avelumab 10 mg/kg was administered intravenously every 2 weeks in all arms. Primary endpoints were dose-limiting toxicities and objective response assessed by investigator per Lugano Response Classification criteria. Secondary endpoints included PD-L1 expression, minimal residual disease, duration of response, time to tumor response, disease control, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. The study also included comprehensive biomarker analyses including cell of origin assessment, immunohistochemical analyses for PD-L1, CD4, CD8, CD68, and 4-1BB/CD137, and minimal residual disease assessment using serial blood samples. The phase Ib component was designed to determine the most active treatment regimen to advance to a planned phase III component; however, due to insufficient antitumor activity in arms A and B and infeasibility of expanding arm C, the study was discontinued before initiation of the phase III component."
