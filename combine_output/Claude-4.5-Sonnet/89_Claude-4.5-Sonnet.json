      "briefSummary": "The management of patients with symptomatic non-acute intracranial artery occlusion (sNA-ICAO), which is a special subset with high morbidity and a high probability of recurrent serious ischemic events despite standard medical therapy (SMT), has been clinically challenging. A number of small-sample clinical studies have also discussed endovascular recanalization (ER) for sNA-ICAO; however, there is currently a lack of evidence from multicenter, prospective, large-sample cohort trials. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the technical feasibility and safety of endovascular recanalization for symptomatic non-acute intracranial artery occlusion. This is a multisite, non-randomized cohort, prospective registry study enrolling consecutive patients presenting with sNA-ICAO at 15 centers in China between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2022. A cohort of patients who received SMT and a cohort of similar patients who received ER plus SMT will be constructed and followed up for 2 years.",
      "detailedDescription": "Large intracranial artery occlusion is a major cause of stroke and is associated with a high risk of stroke recurrence and poor stroke outcome, especially in China. For symptomatic non-acute intracranial artery occlusion (sNA-ICAO) (within 24 h to 6 months), some patients continue to be symptomatic despite standard medical therapy (SMT). Extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) artery bypass surgery fails to show benefits in preventing ischemic attacks or ischemic stroke when performed for sNA-ICAO. The optimal treatment for patients with sNA-ICAO disease remains undefined. Currently, SMT, including an antiplatelet regimen and risk factor management, has been used to treat patients with sNA-ICAO disease. Unfortunately, the natural course of this condition shows that these patients often experience recurrent symptoms despite SMT. Recently, a series of small-sample clinical studies have reported that endovascular recanalization (ER) is feasible for sNA-ICAO. However, most of the previous studies are based on small-sample, single-center retrospective analyses, and there is no high-level evidence from large multicenter samples or prospective studies to indicate the effectiveness and safety of ER for sNA-ICAO.\n\nThis study is a multicenter, prospective registry, non-randomized cohort study sponsored by professor Feng Gao of Beijing Tiantan hospital to assess patients affected by sNA-ICAO undergoing ER and SMT. Fifteen centers across China will participate in the study and provide data. Patients with imaging (MRA/CTA/DSA) and clinical diagnosis of sNA-ICAO will be included. Based on the patient's previous history, imaging features of the lesion and the attitudes of the patient and family members, the local investigative team in each center will determine whether to give SMT plus ER or SMT alone.\n\nStandard Medical Therapy (SMT): Patients in SMT group will take aspirin (100 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) for 90 days followed by lifelong aspirin or clopidogrel monotherapy thereafter. Risk factors including systolic blood pressure and LDL cholesterol will be controlled according to protocols. A lifestyle modification program, INTERVENT, will be provided to each patient.\n\nEndovascular Recanalization (ER) Protocol: A dual antiplatelet regimen with acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg) and clopidogrel (75 mg) is started at least 3 days before the procedure. All procedures are performed under general anesthesia by an experienced interventional neuroradiologist. The procedure involves passage of microcatheter through the occluded segment, balloon dilation, and stent deployment if necessary. Successful revascularization is defined as a modified TICI grade 2b or 3 and residual stenosis <50%. For patients with ICA or MCA M1 segment occlusion, ipsilateral hypoperfusion should be confirmed by CTP or MRI perfusion imaging prior to enrollment.\n\nThe primary outcome is any stroke from enrollment to 2 years of follow-up. The secondary outcomes are all-cause mortality, mRS score, NIHSS score and cognitive function from enrollment to 30 days, 3 months, 8 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 2 years of follow-up. For patients with ICA or MCA M1 segment occlusion, cognitive function assessment is performed at baseline and all follow-up time points. Subgroup analysis will be performed according to angiographic classification, stump morphology, duration from occlusion and clot characteristics. The study aims to recruit 160 patients in the ER plus SMT group and 320 patients in the SMT alone group (1:2 allocation)."
