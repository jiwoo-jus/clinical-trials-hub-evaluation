      "briefSummary": "This randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated the effectiveness of the Korean version of the Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills for Young Adults (PEERS®-YA-K) for young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The study hypothesized that after cultural adaptation, the PEERS®-YA-K would improve relational skills, social skills knowledge, social responsiveness, and reduce comorbid psychosocial distress in young adults with ASD. Participants aged 18-35 years with ASD (IQ > 70) and their social coaches were randomly assigned to either a treatment group (n=19) or a delayed treatment group (n=18). The treatment consisted of 16 weekly 90-minute sessions focusing on conversational skills, friendship development, romantic relationships, and managing peer conflict and rejection. Primary outcomes included social skills knowledge, social responsiveness, and adaptive functioning. Secondary outcomes included depressive and anxiety symptoms.",
      "detailedDescription": "The study was conducted in two main processes: (1) translation and adaptation of the PEERS®-YA treatment manual for Korean culture, and (2) evaluation of the effects through an RCT. The translation process involved converting the American version into Korean and conducting intensive interviews with 29 typically developing young adults (mean age 25 years) to ensure cultural appropriateness, particularly regarding dating etiquette and social activities. The RCT recruited young adults diagnosed with ASD from Seoul National University Bundang Hospital and community organizations. Inclusion criteria included age 18-35 years, high school graduation, social difficulties, verbal fluency, and IQ ≥ 70. Exclusion criteria included major mental illness, significant physical disabilities, and neurological disease. Participants were randomly assigned using randomized block design to either the treatment group (TG) or delayed treatment group (DTG). The intervention consisted of 16 weekly 90-minute sessions with concurrent sessions for young adults and social coaches, led by trained treatment leaders. Treatment fidelity was monitored and averaged 0.95. Outcome measures included ADOS-2, TYASSK (Test of Young Adult Social Skills Knowledge), K-SSRS (Korean Social Skills Rating System), SRS-2 (Social Responsiveness Scale-2), K-VABS (Korean Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale), BDI (Beck Depression Inventory), BAI (Beck Anxiety Inventory), QSQ (Quality of Socialization Questionnaire), SCQ (Social Communication Questionnaire), and STAI (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory). Assessments were conducted at baseline, post-treatment, and 4-month follow-up. Treatment attendance rate was 96.5% with 48.5% homework completion rate. Statistical analyses included independent samples t-tests, paired t-tests, and repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. The study was approved by the IRB of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (IRB no. B-1611/371-303) and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03310775)."

Topics include conversational skills, electronic forms of communication, developing friendship networks, appropriate use of humor, peer entry and exiting strategies, organizing get-togethers, handling teasing and bullying, managing peer pressure, conflict resolution, dating etiquette, showing romantic interest, asking someone on a date, going on dates, and general dating guidelines. Social coaches (e.g., parents, siblings, friends, mentors) attend concurrent sessions to learn how to support the young adults through continuous practice and reinforcement. The Korean version was modified to be culturally sensitive, particularly regarding dating etiquette and social activities, based on intensive interviews with typically developing Korean young adults.",
