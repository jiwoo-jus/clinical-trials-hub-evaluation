      "briefSummary": "This phase II, double-blind, multicenter, randomized study evaluated the efficacy and safety of a novel triple-combination, fixed-dose topical gel containing clindamycin phosphate 1.2%, benzoyl peroxide (BPO) 3.1%, and adapalene 0.15% (IDP-126) for the treatment of acne. The study compared the performance of IDP-126 against a vehicle gel and three component dyad gels (BPO/adapalene, clindamycin/BPO, and clindamycin/adapalene) in participants aged 9 years and older with moderate-to-severe acne. The primary hypothesis was that combining an antibiotic, antibacterial, and retinoid in a single formulation would provide greater efficacy and tolerability than single or dyad treatments.",
      "detailedDescription": "Participants were enrolled from 31 study centers in the USA and four in Canada and were randomized equally to one of five treatment arms to be applied once daily for 12 weeks: IDP-126 gel, BPO 3.1%/adapalene 0.15% gel, clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/BPO 3.1% gel, clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/adapalene 0.15% gel, or vehicle gel. Eligible participants had moderate (Evaluator’s Global Severity Score [EGSS] 3) or severe (EGSS 4) acne, with specific baseline lesion counts (30–100 inflammatory and 35–150 noninflammatory). The coprimary endpoints were treatment success at week 12, defined as achieving a ≥ 2-grade reduction from baseline in EGSS and a score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear), and least-squares mean absolute changes from baseline in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts. Safety assessments included investigator-assessed cutaneous safety (scaling, erythema, hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation), participant-reported tolerability (itching, burning, stinging), and adverse event monitoring. Quality of life was assessed using the Acne-Specific Quality of Life (Acne-QoL) questionnaire."
