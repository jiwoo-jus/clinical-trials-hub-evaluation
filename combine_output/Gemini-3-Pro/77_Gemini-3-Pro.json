      "briefSummary": "This study evaluates the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Gaboxadol (OV101) in adolescent and adult males with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). FXS is a genetic disorder associated with intellectual disability and behavioral challenges, potentially linked to a deficiency in the GABAergic neurotransmitter system. OV101 is an investigational drug designed to target specific GABAA receptors to restore tonic inhibition in the brain. In this 12-week, randomized, double-blind, Phase 2a trial, participants received OV101 either once, twice, or three times daily to assess its potential to improve neurobehavioral symptoms compared to baseline.",
      "detailedDescription": "This 12-week, randomized (1:1:1), double-blind, parallel-group, Phase 2a study was conducted to investigate the safety profile and therapeutic potential of Gaboxadol (OV101) in treating Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). The pathophysiology of FXS involves the silencing of the FMR1 gene and a subsequent lack of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), which leads to reduced expression of the GABAA receptor delta subunit and deficient GABAergic tonic inhibition. OV101 acts as a delta-subunit–selective, extrasynaptic GABAA receptor agonist aiming to enhance this inhibition.\n\nThe study enrolled adolescent and adult males (aged 13–22 years) with clinically and molecularly confirmed FXS and moderate-to-severe neurobehavioral phenotypes. Participants were randomized to receive OV101 5 mg once daily (QD), twice daily (BID), or three-times daily (TID). The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability, measuring treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), laboratory evaluations, and vital signs. The secondary objective focused on efficacy regarding problem behaviors associated with FXS.\n\nEfficacy endpoints included the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale, Clinical Global Impressions–Severity (CGI-S) scale, the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition refactored for FXS (ABC-CFXS), and the Anxiety, Depression, and Mood Scales (ADAMS). Exploratory endpoints included the Repetitive Behavior Scale–Revised (RBS-R) and caregiver-identified top concerns via a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). This proof-of-concept study aimed to identify an optimal dosing regimen and provide an initial signal of efficacy for future larger-scale trials."
