      "briefSummary": "This study is a multicenter, prospective registry designed to evaluate the technical feasibility and safety of endovascular recanalization (ER) for patients with symptomatic non-acute intracranial artery occlusion (sNA-ICAO). The trial aims to test whether ER combined with standard medical therapy (SMT) is superior to SMT alone in the primary prevention of stroke in this high-risk patient population.",
      "detailedDescription": "This is a multisite, non-randomized cohort, prospective registry study enrolling consecutive patients presenting with symptomatic non-acute intracranial artery occlusion (sNA-ICAO) across 15 centers in China from January 2020 to December 2022. Participants are assigned to one of two cohorts based on clinical judgment and patient preference: a group receiving Standard Medical Therapy (SMT) alone and a group receiving Endovascular Recanalization (ER) plus SMT.\n\nSMT consists of a dual antiplatelet regimen (aspirin 100 mg/day and clopidogrel 75 mg/day) for 90 days, followed by lifelong monotherapy, alongside management of risk factors such as systolic blood pressure and LDL cholesterol. The ER protocol is performed under general anesthesia and involves crossing the occluded segment with a microcatheter, balloon dilation, and potential stent implantation if residual severe stenosis or dissection occurs. Successful revascularization is defined as modified TICI grade 2b or 3 with residual stenosis less than 50%.\n\nThe primary outcome is any stroke occurring from enrollment to the 2-year follow-up. Secondary outcomes include all-cause mortality, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, NIHSS score, and cognitive function assessments (using ADAS-Cog, animal naming, letter fluency, and digit span) at 30 days, 3 months, 8 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 2 years. Propensity score matching will be used to compare the groups while adjusting for confounders."
