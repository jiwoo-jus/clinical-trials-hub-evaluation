      "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to incorporate behavioural economic principles and user-centred design principles into a multicomponent intervention for the management of uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) in primary care. This is a multicentre, pragmatic, controlled trial cluster-randomised at the clinician level. The intervention consists of a clinical decision support system that synthesises existing data, increases recognition of CKD and uncontrolled HTN, and delivers evidence-based management recommendations. The primary endpoint is the change in mean systolic blood pressure between baseline and 6 months compared across arms.",
      "detailedDescription": "This pragmatic clinical trial evaluates a multicomponent intervention incorporating clinical decision support (CDS), computable phenotypes, user-centred design principles, and behavioural economic theories to improve hypertension management in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The study is set within the Brigham and Women’s Primary Care Practice-Based Research Network and utilizes a matched-pair cluster randomised design at the clinician level. The intervention includes Epic Best Practices Advisories (BPAs) based on five computable phenotypes regarding ACE inhibitor and ARB prescription or dosage optimization. It also involves a precommitment email to primary care physicians (PCPs) and accountability mechanisms within the CDS. The study utilizes the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to conduct the evaluation. The primary outcome is the change in mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline to 6 months. Secondary outcomes include HTN-specific process measures, CKD quality of care measures, adverse drug events, hypotension, and assessment of implementation success."
