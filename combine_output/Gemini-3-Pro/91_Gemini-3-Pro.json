      "briefSummary": "This parallel-design, double-blind randomized clinical trial, titled Psoriasis Treatment with Abatacept and Ustekinumab: a Study of Efficacy (PAUSE), evaluates whether abatacept could prevent psoriasis relapse after discontinuation of ustekinumab treatment in adults with plaque psoriasis. The study specifically questions whether blockade of CD28/B7 costimulatory signaling with abatacept suppresses the psoriasis molecular signature and prevents psoriasis relapse following ustekinumab withdrawal.",
      "detailedDescription": "Psoriasis vulgaris is a systemic immune-mediated disease perpetuated by an IL-23–mediated psoriasis molecular signature and activated IL-17–producing T cells. While Ustekinumab targets the IL-12/IL-23 pathways, ongoing administration is required to prevent relapse. T-cell activation relies on costimulation by CD28 on ligation of CD80/CD86; abatacept (CTLA4-Ig) blocks this interaction, inhibiting T-cell activation. It was hypothesized that costimulatory blockade with abatacept could induce tolerance in pathogenic T cells in resolving lesions, leading to long-term remission.\n\nThe PAUSE trial consisted of a lead-in phase (weeks 0 to 12), a randomized treatment phase (weeks 12 to 40), and an observation phase (weeks 40 to 88). During the lead-in phase, participants with moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris received subcutaneous ustekinumab at weeks 0 and 4. Those who responded to ustekinumab at week 12 (achieving ≥75% improvement from baseline Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI]) were randomized 1:1 to either the continued ustekinumab group or the switched to abatacept group.\n\nParticipants randomized to the abatacept group received subcutaneous abatacept, 125 mg weekly, from weeks 12 to 39 and ustekinumab placebo at weeks 16 and 28. Participants randomized to the ustekinumab group received ustekinumab at weeks 16 and 28 and abatacept placebo weekly from weeks 12 to 39. Treatment was discontinued at week 39, and participants were followed up for psoriasis relapse until week 88.\n\nThe primary end point was the proportion of participants with psoriasis relapse (defined as loss of ≥50% of the initial PASI improvement) between weeks 12 and 88. Secondary end points included time to psoriasis relapse, proportion of participants with psoriasis relapse between weeks 12 and 40, and adverse events. Additionally, the psoriasis transcriptome in lesional skin and serum cytokines were evaluated to identify mechanisms associated with treatment outcomes."
