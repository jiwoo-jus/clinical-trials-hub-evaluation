      "briefSummary": "The Bridging Recovery Initiative Despite Gaps in Entry (BRIDGE) trial is a pragmatic, single-center, randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a transitional 'bridge' clinic for hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). The study compares outcomes between patients referred to a co-located, multidisciplinary bridge clinic and those receiving usual care (referral to community providers). The primary objective is to determine if the bridge clinic model reduces hospital length of stay, while secondary objectives include assessing readmission rates, linkage to care, and quality of life.",
      "detailedDescription": "This study is a pragmatic, superiority, randomized controlled trial enrolling hospitalized patients aged 18 and older with active opioid use disorder (OUD) who are initiating medication for OUD (MOUD), such as buprenorphine-naloxone or naltrexone, in consultation with an addiction consult service. \n\nPatients are randomized 1:1 to either referral to a transitional, multidisciplinary bridge clinic or to usual care. The randomization process is leveraged by the fixed capacity of the bridge clinic. The intervention group receives wraparound services from a team comprising physicians (addiction psychiatry, internal medicine, infectious diseases, pain-anesthesia), nurse practitioners, social workers, case managers, and recovery coaches. This team facilitates the transition from the hospital to long-term outpatient care. The control group receives usual care, which involves standard discharge planning and referral to community MOUD providers by the primary medical team's social worker.\n\nThe primary endpoint is the index hospital length of stay (LOS). Secondary endpoints include 16-week follow-up measures such as linkage to MOUD providers, self-reported medication fills, readmission rates, emergency department visits, recurrent opioid use, overdose, mortality, costs of care, and quality of life measurements (Schwartz Outcome Scale-10 and EQ-5D-5L). For patients with infections suitable for outpatient management, additional outcomes include recurrent infection and completion of antibiotic therapy."
