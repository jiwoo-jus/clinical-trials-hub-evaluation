      "briefSummary": "This pilot trial tests the feasibility of using a smartband and smartphone to monitor and detect smoking and deliver brief mindfulness interventions in real time to reduce smoking. Daily smokers wear a smartband for 60 days to monitor and detect smoking, notify them about their smoking events in real time, and deliver real-time brief mindfulness exercises triggered by detected smoking events or targeted at predicted smoking events.",
      "detailedDescription": "This study tests a three-step intervention to reduce smoking among daily smokers (N=100, ≥5 cigarettes per day) over a 60-day period. Participants wear a smartband developed by Somatix, Inc., which uses a machine learning algorithm to identify hand-to-mouth gestures that characterize smoking. \n\nThe intervention proceeds in three phases: \n1. For the first 21 days, the smartband monitors and detects smoking, notifying participants of smoking events in real time to bring awareness to smoking behavior and triggers. Participants are asked to confirm or deny smoking events via the smartphone app.\n2. For the next 7 days (days 21-28), a 'mindful smoking' exercise is triggered by detected smoking events to bring a clear recognition of the actual effects of smoking (physical sensations, emotions, thoughts).\n3. Finally, after a set quit date at 30 days, a 'RAIN' (recognize, allow, investigate, nonidentification) mindfulness exercise is delivered to predicted smoking events (based on the initial 3 weeks of tracking smoking data) to help smokers learn to work mindfully with cravings rather than smoke for 30 days.\n\nThe primary outcomes are feasibility measures of treatment fidelity, adherence, and acceptability. Secondary outcomes include smoking rates and abstinence at the end of treatment."
