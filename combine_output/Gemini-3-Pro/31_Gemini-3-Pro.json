      "briefSummary": "This study is a randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase 2 proof-of-concept trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of favipiravir in hospitalized adult patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–positive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Favipiravir, a nucleoside analog with antiviral activity against RNA viruses, was administered orally in addition to standard of care (SOC) and compared against SOC alone. The primary objective was to measure the time to viral clearance by day 29, assessing whether favipiravir accelerates the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized patients.",
      "detailedDescription": "The trial was conducted at 7 US academic medical centers involving hospitalized adults (ages 18–80) with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by PCR within 72 hours of hospitalization and symptom onset within 10 days. Patients were stratified by disease severity (critical, severe, or mild to moderate) and randomized to receive either standard of care (SOC) alone or favipiravir plus SOC. The favipiravir dosing regimen was 1800 mg orally twice a day (b.i.d.) on day 1, followed by 1000 mg b.i.d. for 13 days (total 14 days). Patients with Child-Pugh A liver disease received a reduced maintenance dose.\n\nThe primary endpoint was time to viral clearance, defined as the number of days from randomization to the first negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR result (or result below the lower limit of detection) from scheduled nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, assessed up to day 29. Secondary endpoints included clinical recovery status measured by a study-specific 6-point ordinal scale, time to clinical recovery (normalization of fever, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and alleviation of cough), clinical effect via the NEWS2 system, all-cause mortality, frequency of respiratory progression, and safety profiles. Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed to assess plasma favipiravir levels. Post hoc analyses examined the impact of baseline neutralizing antibody status and time from symptom onset on viral clearance."
