      "briefSummary": "This prospective, open-label, multicenter clinical trial aimed to establish the long-term efficacy and safety of leuprorelin for the treatment of central precocious puberty (CPP) in children. Patients were treated with subcutaneous leuprorelin (1.88 to 3.75 mg) once every 4 weeks for a total of 96 weeks. The primary focus was on the rate of adverse events, while secondary objectives included monitoring the progression of puberty via Tanner staging, hormone concentrations, and bone age.",
      "detailedDescription": "Leuprorelin is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog used to downregulate GnRH receptors and inhibit gonadotropin secretion, thereby preventing the development of secondary sexual characteristics in Central Precocious Puberty (CPP). While widely used, specific long-term safety and efficacy data for leuprorelin at doses of 30 to 180 μg/kg in the Chinese population were lacking.\n\nThis trial enrolled 307 children diagnosed with CPP across 11 medical centers in China between 2015 and 2018. The study design included a 4-week screening period, a 96-week treatment phase, and a 4-week safety follow-up. Eligible patients with a body mass ≥20 kg received 3.75 mg of leuprorelin subcutaneously every 4 weeks, while those with a body mass <20 kg received 1.88 mg. Dosage adjustments were permitted based on patient condition and investigator judgment.\n\nThe primary endpoint was the rate of occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). The main secondary endpoint was the percentage of patients experiencing regression or no progression in Tanner stage at week 96 compared to baseline. Additional efficacy endpoints included the suppression of peak Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) concentrations in stimulation tests, suppression of basal estradiol or testosterone concentrations, improvement in predicted adult height, changes in the ratio of bone age to chronological age, and changes in Body Mass Index (BMI) and Bone Mineral Density (BMD)."
