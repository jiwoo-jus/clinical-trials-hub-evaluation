      "briefSummary": "This study assesses the efficacy and safety of RIST4721 compared to a placebo in adult subjects suffering from moderate to severe Palmoplantar Pustulosis (PPP). PPP is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by neutrophil infiltration. RIST4721 is a potent CXCR2 antagonist designed to block neutrophil influx to sites of inflammation. The trial involves a 4-week, double-blind treatment period to determine if the drug can effectively reduce pustule counts and improve disease severity symptoms compared to the placebo.",
      "detailedDescription": "This phase 2a, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigated the oral administration of RIST4721 versus placebo in subjects with moderate to severe Palmoplantar Pustulosis (PPP). The study was conducted at sites in Canada and Germany. Key eligibility criteria included a history of PPP for at least 6 months, a Palmoplantar Pustulosis Area and Severity Index (PPPASI) ≥ 8, and a Palmoplantar Pustulosis Physician Global Assessment (PPPGA) ≥ 3. \n\nEligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either RIST4721 300 mg or placebo solution orally once daily for 28 days. The study duration included an up to 30-day screening period, a 28-day treatment period, and a 14-day follow-up period. The primary efficacy endpoints were the relative change from baseline in fresh and total pustule counts at day 28. Secondary and exploratory endpoints included absolute change from baseline in pustule counts, the proportion of subjects achieving at least a 50% reduction in pustule counts, changes in PPPASI, Palmoplantar Pustulosis Severity Index (PPSI), pain visual analogue scale (VAS), and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Safety assessments included monitoring of adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory tests, specifically looking at absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) and pharmacokinetics."
