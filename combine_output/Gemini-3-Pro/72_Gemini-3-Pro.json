      "briefSummary": "This study evaluated the prognostic significance of detectable circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) BRAFV600E/K mutations in patients with advanced melanoma. Utilizing samples from the North Central Cancer Treatment Group/Alliance N0879 randomized phase 2 clinical trial, researchers compared BRAF mutation status in archived tissue against pretreatment stored plasma. The study aimed to determine if the presence of detectable cfDNA mutations correlates with Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) in a population receiving chemotherapy without BRAF-targeted therapy.",
      "detailedDescription": "The study population consisted of 149 patients with unresectable stage IV melanoma enrolled in the NCCTG N0879 trial between May 2010 and May 2014. The original trial assessed a regimen of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab with or without everolimus. In this retrospective analysis, BRAFV600E/K mutation status was established using archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue via a 50-gene hotspot PCR-based MiSeq panel. This was compared to cfDNA extracted from stored frozen plasma samples using a validated digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) assay on the RainDrop Digital PCR System.\n\nThe analysis focused on the concordance between tissue and plasma results, reporting sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Furthermore, the study assessed the prognostic implications of cfDNA status by analyzing Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) using the Kaplan-Meier method. The study specifically investigated whether detectable cfDNA BRAFV600E/K mutations in patients with tissue-diagnosed mutant BRAF were associated with poorer clinical outcomes."
