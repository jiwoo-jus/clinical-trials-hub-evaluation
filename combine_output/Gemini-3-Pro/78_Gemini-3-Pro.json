      "briefSummary": "This ongoing phase 1/2, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of the AZD1222 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccine in Japanese adults. Participants aged 18 years and older, stratified into cohorts including elderly individuals (≥70 years), were randomized to receive two intramuscular doses of AZD1222 or placebo administered 4 weeks apart. The study reports on immunogenicity responses and safety data collected up to Day 57.",
      "detailedDescription": "The study enrolled 256 adults seronegative for SARS-CoV-2, stratified by age into 18–55 (n=128), 56–69 (n=86), and ≥70-year-old cohorts (n=42). Participants were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either AZD1222 (5 × 10^10 viral particles/dose) or saline placebo on Days 1 and 29. Coprimary endpoints included immunogenicity, measured by anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike seroresponse (≥4-fold rise in titre from baseline) at Day 57, and safety, measured by solicited local and systemic adverse events (AEs) for 6 days post-dose and unsolicited AEs for 28 days post-dose. Secondary endpoints included seroresponse for the receptor-binding domain (RBD) antigen and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (nAb) titres. The trial aimed to assess the vaccine's profile in the Japanese population, particularly in older age groups at higher risk for severe COVID-19."
