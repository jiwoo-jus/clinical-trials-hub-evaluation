      "briefSummary": "This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Korean version of the Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills for Young Adults (PEERS®-YA-K). The study hypothesized that the PEERS®-YA-K would improve relational skills, social skills knowledge, social responsiveness, and decrease comorbid psychosocial distress in young adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), even after modification for cultural differences.",
      "detailedDescription": "Evidence-based social skills interventions for young adults are limited, despite social difficulties in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) persisting after transition to adulthood. The Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills for Young Adults (PEERS®-YA) is an evidence-based intervention found to be effective in improving relational skills in young adults with ASD. To translate the original American version of the PEERS®-YA treatment manual into Korean, intensive interviews were performed. Based on results from interviews, several rules of dating etiquette and social activities were modified to be culturally sensitive and linguistically appropriate.\n\nNext, young adults diagnosed with ASD (18–35 years of age; IQ > 70) and their social coaches were recruited for the randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants were randomly assigned either to a treatment group (TG; n = 19) or a delayed treatment group (DTG; n = 18). The intervention consisted of 16 weekly 90-minute sessions. Social coaches and the young adults were given concurrent sessions in separate rooms. Lessons focused on social skills necessary for developing and maintaining friendships, romantic relationships, and managing peer conflict and rejection.\n\nPrimary outcome measures included the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2 Module 4), Test of Young Adult Social Skills Knowledge (TYASSK), Korean Version of the Social Skills Rating System (K-SSRS), and Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2). Secondary measures included the Korean Version of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, Second Edition (K-VABS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Exploratory measures included the Quality of Socialization Questionnaire (QSQ), Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Assessments were conducted pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at a 4-month follow-up to evaluate maintenance of effects."
