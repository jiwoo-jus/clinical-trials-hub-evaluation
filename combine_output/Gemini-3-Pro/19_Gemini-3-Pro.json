      "briefSummary": "This study was designed to assess the efficacy of Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis (Bl-04) for prevention of rhinovirus colds and to explore the interactions between the probiotic, the viral infection, the host response and the host microbiome.",
      "detailedDescription": "The effect of ingestion of the probiotic Bl-04 was evaluated in a randomized, double-blinded rhinovirus (RV) challenge study. Healthy volunteers recruited from a university community in USA were randomized 1:1 using a computer generated code to ingest either Bl-04 (n=165) or placebo (n=169) for 28 days and were then challenged with RV-A39, and followed for 14 days. All study interactions and sample collection occurred in dedicated clinical research space. The primary analysis was the effect of the probiotic on the incidence of RV-associated illness.\n\nVolunteers were assigned sequential subject numbers as they enrolled in the study and then provided numbered study product corresponding to their subject number. On day -28 of the study, all eligible volunteers had specimens collected and were then randomized to active or placebo supplement to be taken daily through study day 14. Volunteers returned to the study site on days -21, -14, and -7 to replenish supplies of study product and to monitor compliance with the study protocol. During the supplementation period, days -28 to 14, the volunteers were instructed to avoid ingestion of other probiotics or probiotic containing foods and were prohibited from taking antibiotics or anti-inflammatory agents.\n\nThe challenge virus used for this study was RV-A39. All subjects were inoculated with 20-100 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) of virus by intranasal drops. Nasal lavage specimens collected on day 0, before virus challenge, were tested by multiplex PCR for the detection of unsuspected viral infections. Nasal lavage collected on study days 1-5 was cultured for RV by standard methods. Sera were tested for neutralizing antibody to RV-A39 by a standard microtiter assay."
