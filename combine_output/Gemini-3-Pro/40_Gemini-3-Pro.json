      "briefSummary": "This randomized within-subjects clinical study aims to establish the safety and efficacy of virtual reality (VR) therapy as a pain management intervention for patients with acute traumatic injuries, including traumatic brain injury (TBI). The study compares immersive VR therapy against two control conditions (a non-immersive tablet display and a blank VR headset) to evaluate reductions in pain intensity, as well as changes in affective and physiological measures, thereby assessing VR's potential as a non-pharmacological analgesic to reduce opioid reliance.",
      "detailedDescription": "This study utilizes a randomized, within-subject, crossover design to evaluate the use of immersive VR in an inpatient trauma setting. Sixty participants with traumatic injuries, including mild TBI, will be recruited at the R. Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center. Participants will undergo three 20-minute sessions in a randomized order, separated by at least 4 hours: 1) Immersive VR experience using 'theBlu' on an Oculus Rift; 2) Non-immersive two-dimensional mimic displaying the same content on a tablet; and 3) VR sensory deprivation using a content-less headset.\n\nThe primary outcome is the reduction in pain severity measured by pre- and post-session numerical rating scales. Exploratory secondary outcomes include opioid usage, pain durability, affective measures (such as anxiety via STAI, depression via HADS, and pain catastrophizing), and autonomic measures (heart rate, heart rate variability, and pupillometry). The study also aims to validate the safety and feasibility of VR in TBI patients by monitoring for adverse events like seizures or motion sickness. Furthermore, it seeks to identify patient characteristics—such as gaming engagement, boredom, and suggestibility—that may predict a favorable response to VR therapy."
