      "briefSummary": "This paper presents the protocol for a study investigating the effectiveness of a Behavioral Economics-Electronic Health Record (BE-EHR) module intervention. The intervention leverages behavioral economics nudges within EHR technology and clinical decision support tools to reduce overtreatment of type 2 diabetes in adults aged 76 years and older, in accordance with the American Geriatrics Society Choosing Wisely (CW) guideline. The study is a pragmatic, investigator-blind, cluster randomized controlled trial comparing the BE-EHR module plus standard care against standard care alone.",
      "detailedDescription": "A pragmatic, investigator-blind, cluster randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate a 6-component BE-EHR module intervention. A total of 66 New York University Langone Health (NYULH) clinics were randomized 1:1 to receive for 18 months either (1) a 6-component BE-EHR module intervention plus standard care within the NYULH EHR, or (2) standard care only. The intervention is administered to clinicians during patient encounters (e.g., in person, telemedicine, medication refill). \n\nThe BE-EHR module consists of 6 components or \"nudges\" utilizing behavioral economics principles:\n1. Tailored Advisory: A noninterruptive alert describing appropriate treatment guidelines based on patient life expectancy.\n2. Refill Protocol: An alert suggesting metformin optimization or deprescribing during refill generation.\n3. Preference List: A system-level default list prioritizing metformin.\n4. Lab Result: An alert displaying guidelines when new HbA1c results are viewed.\n5. Peer Comparison: A monthly email comparing provider CW compliance rates.\n6. Campaign: A gamified educational email campaign regarding CW guidelines.\n\nThe primary outcome is patient-level CW compliance. Secondary outcomes measure the frequency of intervention component firings and provider utilization/interaction with the module components. The study specifically targets older adults (aged 76+) to promote less aggressive glycemic targets and reduction in pharmacologic therapy."
