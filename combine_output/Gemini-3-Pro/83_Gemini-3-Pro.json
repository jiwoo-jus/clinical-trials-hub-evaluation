      "briefSummary": "This study explores the neural mechanisms underlying the interaction between anxiety and cognition. While anxiety typically impairs cognition, engaging in demanding tasks can reduce anxiety. The researchers investigated whether pharmacologically improving attentional processes using methylphenidate (a cognitive enhancer) influences the interplay between neural networks engaged during anxiety and cognitive performance. The study hypothesizes that enhancing cognitive resources may allow for better integration of anxiety-provoking stimuli and top-down regulation to protect against the negative effects of anxiety.",
      "detailedDescription": "Using a double-blind, between-subject design, this study pharmacologically manipulated working memory (WM) using a single oral dose of 20 mg methylphenidate (MPH) or placebo. Fifty healthy adults (25 per group) performed two runs of an N-back WM task in a 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. The task included low (1-Back) and high (3-Back) WM loads and was performed in two contexts: safety or threat of unpredictable electrical shocks (induced-anxiety). \n\nThe study aimed to test three potential neural mechanisms regarding the relationship between cognitive enhancement and anxiety reduction: (A) Increased dissociation between the fronto-parietal control network (FPCN) and the default mode network (DMN); (B) Redistribution of cognitive resources characterized by lower FPCN resource allocation and increased DMN engagement; or (C) Expansion of overall neural resources reflected by stronger activation of both the FPCN and the DMN. Behavioral measures included response accuracy and reaction time, alongside subjective anxiety ratings collected via the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-s)."
