      "briefSummary": "KEYNOTE-063 is a randomized, open-label, phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab compared with paclitaxel as a second-line therapy in Asian patients with advanced, PD-L1-positive (combined positive score ≥1) gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer. The study was conducted across medical centers in China, Malaysia, South Korea, and Taiwan.",
      "detailedDescription": "This study investigated pembrolizumab versus paclitaxel in Asian patients with advanced programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)–positive gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer who had experienced disease progression during or after first-line therapy containing any platinum/fluoropyrimidine doublet chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 200 mg of pembrolizumab intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 2 years (35 cycles) or 80 mg/m2 of paclitaxel intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 4-week cycle. Stratification factors included time to progression on first-line therapy (<6 vs ≥6 months) and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1). The primary end points were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 and safety. Enrollment for the study was stopped early based on the results of the global KEYNOTE-061 study."
