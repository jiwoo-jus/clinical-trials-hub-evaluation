      "briefSummary": "This trial assessed the safety and effectiveness of an advanced hybrid closed-loop (AHCL) system with automated basal and automated bolus correction capabilities in adolescents and adults with type 1 diabetes. The study involved a run-in period followed by a study phase where participants used the MiniMed AHCL system with varying glucose targets.",
      "detailedDescription": "This multicenter single-arm study involved an intent-to-treat population of 157 individuals (39 adolescents aged 14–21 years and 118 adults aged ≥22–75 years) with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The study schedule included a run-in period (Visits 1–4) with sensor-augmented pump (SAP) with or without predictive low glucose management (PLGM) or automated basal (Auto Basal) use for approximately 14 days. This was followed by a study phase (Visits 5–18) where Auto Basal and automated bolus correction (Auto Correction) were enabled for approximately 90 days. A glucose target of 100 or 120 mg/dL was set during the first 45 ± 5 days of the study phase, followed by a switch to the other glucose target for the remaining 45 ± 5 days. Study endpoints included safety events and change in mean A1C, time in range (TIR, 70–180 mg/dL) and time below range (TBR, <70 mg/dL). Run-in and study phase values were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank test or paired t-test. The AHCL system includes a meal detection module and provides options for setting different glucose targets."
