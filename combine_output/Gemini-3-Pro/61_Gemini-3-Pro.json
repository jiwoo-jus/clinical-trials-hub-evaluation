      "briefSummary": "The objective of this study was to determine if inhaled and intranasal ciclesonide are superior to placebo at decreasing respiratory symptoms in adult outpatients with COVID-19. Based on in vitro data showing antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and the known anti-inflammatory effect of ciclesonide, the investigators hypothesized that ciclesonide administered early in the course of COVID-19 could decrease symptom burden in adults presenting with prominent respiratory symptoms.",
      "detailedDescription": "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (CONTAIN) enrolled adults aged 18 years and older with polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID-19, presenting with fever, cough, or dyspnoea. Participants were recruited from Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either inhaled ciclesonide (600 μg twice daily) and intranasal ciclesonide (200 μg daily) or metered dose inhaler and nasal saline placebos for 14 days. \n\nThe primary outcome measure was symptom resolution at day 7. Key secondary outcomes included hospital admission or death with COVID-19, symptom resolution at day 14, and improvement in overall feeling. Analyses were conducted on the modified intention-to-treat population (participants who took at least one dose of study drug and completed one follow-up survey) and adjusted for stratified randomization by sex. The trial was stopped early due to expected futility to meet total enrollment targets amidst rising vaccination rates and declining case numbers."
