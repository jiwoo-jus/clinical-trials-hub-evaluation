      "briefSummary": "This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effects of three different exercise regimens relative to an attention control group in post-treatment lung cancer survivors with poor cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). The study aimed to determine the most effective exercise modality—aerobic training, resistance training, or a combination of both—for improving peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) over a 16-week intervention period.",
      "detailedDescription": "Using a parallel-group, factorial randomized controlled trial design, lung cancer survivors with poor CRF (defined as VO2peak below age–sex sedentary values) were randomly allocated to one of four groups for 16 weeks (48 supervised sessions, thrice weekly). The interventions included: (i) Aerobic Training (AT): cycle ergometry at intensities ranging from 55% to >95% of VO2peak; (ii) Resistance Training (RT): lower and upper extremity exercises at 50–85% of maximal strength; (iii) Combination Training (CT): a mix of AT and RT; and (iv) Attention Control (AC): a stretching program. The primary endpoint was the change in CRF measured by VO2peak (mL O2·kg−1·min−1). Secondary endpoints assessed body composition, maximal muscle strength, patient-reported outcomes (quality of life, fatigue, pain, sleep quality), and tolerability metrics such as relative dose intensity and safety."
