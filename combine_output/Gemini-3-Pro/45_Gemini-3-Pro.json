      "briefSummary": "This study is a multicentric, open-label, Bayesian randomised, adaptive, phase 2/3 clinical trial, nested within the CORIMUNO-19 cohort. It aims to test the hypothesis that sarilumab, a high-affinity anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, might improve the outcome of patients hospitalised with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia compared to usual care alone. Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia often present with increased inflammation and elevated cytokines, which sarilumab targets.",
      "detailedDescription": "The trial enrolled patients 18 years or older hospitalised with COVID-19 in six French centres. Eligible participants required at least 3L/min of oxygen but without ventilation assistance and had a WHO Clinical Progression Scale [CPS] score of 5. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) via a web-based system, stratified by centre, to receive usual care plus 400 mg of sarilumab intravenously on day 1 and on day 3 if clinically indicated (sarilumab group) or usual care alone (usual care group). \n\nThe primary outcomes were the proportion of patients with WHO-CPS scores greater than 5 on the 10-point scale on day 4 and survival without invasive or non-invasive ventilation at day 14. Secondary outcomes included clinical status assessed with the WHO-CPS at day 7 and day 14, overall survival, time to discharge, time to oxygen supply independence, and safety. This specific report covers the CORIMUNO-SARI-1 trial, focusing on patients with moderate-to-severe pneumonia (non-ICU)."
