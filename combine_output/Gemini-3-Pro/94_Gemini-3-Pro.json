      "briefSummary": "This phase 3 randomized clinical trial evaluates the manufacturing equivalence, immunogenicity, and safety of a 3-antigen hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine compared with a single-antigen HBV vaccine in healthy adults aged 18 to 45 years. The study tests the hypothesis that the 3-antigen vaccine demonstrates consistency across manufacturing lots and noninferior seroprotection rates compared to the standard single-antigen vaccine.",
      "detailedDescription": "The study design was a phase 3, double-blinded, randomized, multicenter, lot-to-lot consistency study involving healthy adults aged 18 to 45 years. Participants were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive one of three independent consecutive lots of the 3-antigen HBV (3A-HBV) vaccine or a comparator single-antigen (1A-HBV) vaccine. The 3A-HBV vaccine contains pre-S1, pre-S2, and S antigens produced in mammalian cells, whereas the comparator contains only the S antigen. Vaccines were administered intramuscularly on days 0, 28, and 168. The primary efficacy endpoint was the manufacturing equivalence of the three 3A-HBV lots, assessed by the geometric mean concentration (GMC) of anti-HBs antibodies 4 weeks after the third injection. Secondary endpoints included demonstrating that the seroprotection rate (SPR) of the pooled 3A-HBV vaccine was noninferior to that of the 1A-HBV vaccine at day 196, as well as comparing safety and reactogenicity profiles between the two vaccine types."
