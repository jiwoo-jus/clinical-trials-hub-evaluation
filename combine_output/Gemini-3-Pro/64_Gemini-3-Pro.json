      "briefSummary": "The RECORGEN study is a retrospective single-center cohort study evaluating the effectiveness and safety of ultrasound-guided conventional radiofrequency (RF) treatment of the genicular nerves. The study focuses on patients suffering from chronic knee pain, specifically those with persistent postsurgical knee pain (PPSP) and degenerative knee pain (such as osteoarthritis) who have been refractory to conventional medical management. The primary goal is to assess treatment success, defined as a Global Perceived Effect (GPE) of at least 50% improvement, along with pain reduction and safety outcomes.",
      "detailedDescription": "This retrospective observational study analyzes data from patients treated with ultrasound-guided conventional radiofrequency (RF) ablation of the genicular nerves at the Hospital Oost-Limburg, Genk, between September 2017 and June 2020. The cohort consists of patients with chronic anterior knee pain classified into two subgroups: those with persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP), primarily following total knee arthroplasty, and those with degenerative knee pain (DP), including osteoarthritis and soft tissue disease.\n\nThe intervention involved ultrasound-guided conventional RF treatment of the superomedial, inferomedial, and superolateral genicular nerves at 70°C for 90 seconds, performed after a confirmed positive diagnostic block. \n\nThe primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving treatment success at 6 weeks, defined as a Global Perceived Effect (GPE) score of ≥50% compared to baseline. Secondary objectives included evaluating treatment success at a later cross-sectional time point, reduction in Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores (≥50% reduction), subjective physical functioning, changes in the consumption of strong opioids, and the duration of the treatment effect. Safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring adverse events at 6 weeks and at the second follow-up time point."
