      "briefSummary": "The Multicenter Study to Transplant Hepatitis C-Infected Kidneys (MYTHIC) is a multicenter trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of transplanting kidneys from Hepatitis C virus (HCV) viremic donors into HCV-negative patients. The study protocol involves administering an 8-week course of the direct-acting antiviral therapy glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, initiated 2 to 5 days after transplantation. The study compares the probability of receiving a kidney transplant for participants versus matched waitlist comparators and assesses 1-year outcomes, including HCV cure rates, allograft function, and patient survival.",
      "detailedDescription": "MYTHIC (NCT03781726) is an open-label, multicenter clinical trial designed to assess the outcomes of HCV D-RNA-positive/R-negative kidney transplantation (KT). The study enrolled candidates aged 21 to 65 years who were on dialysis or had an estimated glomerular filtration rate <15 ml/min per 1.73 m2, excluding those with HIV, Hepatitis B, or significant liver fibrosis (liver stiffness >8 kPa). A total of 30 patients underwent HCV D-RNA-positive/R-negative KT and received 8 weeks of oral glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P) initiated between days 2 and 5 post-KT.\n\nThe primary outcome was HCV cure, defined as a sustained virologic response (undetectable plasma HCV RNA) 12 weeks after the completion of G/P therapy. The study also conducted a matched cohort analysis to compare the 1-year cumulative probability of transplantation between MYTHIC enrollees and matched United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) comparators who did not opt-in for HCV-viremic donor kidneys. \n\nAdditional 1-year endpoints included patient survival, allograft survival and function (measured by serum creatinine and eGFR), rejection rates, liver function, and the incidence of infectious complications such as Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and BK virus (BKV). The study utilized expert adjudication for CMV cases to distinguish between viremia and clinical disease. Results demonstrated a significantly higher probability of transplantation for MYTHIC participants, 100% HCV cure rates among recipients of viremic kidneys, and excellent graft function at 1 year."
