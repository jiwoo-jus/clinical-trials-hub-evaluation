      "briefSummary": "A first-in-human, randomized pilot phase II clinical trial combining vaccines targeting overexpressed, non-mutated tumor blood vessel antigens (TBVA) and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib conducted in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2+ patients with advanced melanoma. The study evaluates the safety, immunogenicity, and antitumor efficacy of intradermal administration of autologous type-1 dendritic cells loaded with TBVA-derived peptides combined with daily oral administration of dasatinib.",
      "detailedDescription": "This single-center, prospective randomized pilot phase II clinical trial enrolled HLA-A2+ patients with advanced-stage (IIC-IV) cutaneous, mucosal, or uveal melanoma for whom standard curative or palliative measures were no longer effective. Patients were randomized into one of two treatment arms. All treated patients received an autologous alphaDC1/peptide vaccine administered by a single intradermal injection on days 1 and 15 of each monthly therapy cycle. The vaccine consisted of patient monocyte-derived type-1-polarized dendritic cells loaded with HLA-A2-presented peptides derived from TBVA (DLK1, EphA2, HBB, NRP1, RGS5, TEM1). Patients on Arm A started oral dasatinib (70 mg two times per day) on cycle 2, day 1 (week 5), while patients on Arm B began dasatinib administration on cycle 1, day 1 (week 1). Dasatinib was included as an immune adjuvant/conditioning agent intended to promote superior expansion and recruitment of therapeutic T cells, reduce tumor hypoxia and immunosuppressive cells, and extend overall survival. Primary endpoints included patient peripheral blood T cell response to vaccine peptides based on interferon-gamma ELISPOT analyses. Secondary endpoints included safety, objective clinical response (RECIST V.1.1), progression-free survival, and overall survival."
