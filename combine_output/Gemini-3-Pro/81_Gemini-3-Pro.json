      "briefSummary": "Severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is associated with adverse outcomes, but relationships between milder ROP and outcomes have not been well defined. This study hypothesized that children with ROP stage ≤3 who did not receive ophthalmologic intervention would have worse motor, cognitive, and language skills and more vision abnormalities than children without ROP. The study found that children with milder forms of ROP did not have adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years’ corrected age compared to children without ROP, though they did exhibit an increased incidence of strabismus.",
      "detailedDescription": "This investigation was a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of myo-inositol on ROP in the NICHD Neonatal Research Network. The study aimed to address the knowledge gap regarding the relationship between ROP that regresses without intervention and neurodevelopment in early childhood.\n\nThe study population consisted of 506 children born extremely preterm (<28 weeks’ gestation) evaluated at 22-26 months’ corrected age. Participants were categorized into three groups: 1) children with no history of ROP, 2) children with history of ROP stage ≤3 without ophthalmologic intervention, and 3) children with history of ROP with ophthalmologic intervention (retinal ablation, scleral buckling, vitrectomy, or anti-VEGF therapy).\n\nPrimary outcomes were assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd Edition (Bayley-III) composite scores for motor, cognitive, and language skills. Secondary outcomes included behavioral difficulties assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and ophthalmologic measures such as strabismus, nystagmus, roving eye movements, tracking ability, and visual acuity history.\n\nStatistical analyses utilized adjusted linear or modified Poisson models, adjusting for baseline covariates including maternal race, gestational age, sex, and severe IVH. Results showed no difference in Bayley-III scores between children with ROP stage ≤3 without intervention and those without ROP. However, children requiring intervention had significantly lower composite scores and worse visual acuity. The study concludes that while mild ROP is not associated with general neurodevelopmental impairment at 2 years, ophthalmologic follow-up is necessary due to increased risks of strabismus."
