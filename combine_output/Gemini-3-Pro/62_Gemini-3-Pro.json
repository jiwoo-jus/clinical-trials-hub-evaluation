      "briefSummary": "The THUNDERBEAT is a multi-functional energy device which delivers both ultrasonic and bipolar energy. The aim of this prospective randomized trial was to compare the clinical performance of the THUNDERBEAT energy device to the Maryland LigaSure device in patients undergoing left laparoscopic colectomy. The study evaluates dissection time to specimen removal, device versatility, and safety outcomes in patients with cancer or diverticulitis.",
      "detailedDescription": "This study was designed as a pilot prospective randomized trial in a single academic institution involving 60 patients undergoing elective left laparoscopic colectomy for neoplasm or diverticulitis. Subjects were randomized 1:1 into two groups: Group 1 using THUNDERBEAT and Group 2 using Maryland LigaSure. \n\nThe primary outcomes were dissection time to specimen removal (DTSR), defined as the time in minutes from the start of colon mobilization to specimen removal, and a versatility score. The versatility score was a weighted composite of five variables (hemostasis, sealing, cutting, dissection, and tissue manipulation) evaluated across six specific surgical segments. Secondary outcomes included the dryness of the surgical field, surgeon evaluation surveys regarding device handling and satisfaction, and intraoperative and postoperative complications such as bleeding, thermal spread, and recovery parameters. Patients were followed up for 30 days post-surgery."
