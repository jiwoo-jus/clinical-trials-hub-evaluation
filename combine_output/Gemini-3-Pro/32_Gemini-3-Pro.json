      "briefSummary": "This phase 1/2 clinical trial (MM1636) investigated the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of a first-in-class immune-modulatory vaccine (IO102/IO103) targeting indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab. The study enrolled patients with metastatic melanoma, specifically focusing on anti-PD-1 therapy-naive patients in the reported cohort. The treatment aimed to activate specific T cells against immunosuppressive and tumor cells expressing IDO and/or PD-L1 to modulate the tumor microenvironment.",
      "detailedDescription": "Despite advances with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), resistance to monotherapy remains a challenge in metastatic melanoma. This study evaluates a combination strategy using an immune-modulatory vaccine targeting tumoral immune escape mechanisms alongside nivolumab. The vaccine consists of IO102, a 21-amino-acid peptide from IDO, and IO103, a 19-amino-acid peptide from the signal peptide of PD-L1, combined with the adjuvant Montanide ISA-51. \n\nThe mechanism relies on the hypothesis that IDO/PD-L1-specific T cells can recognize and kill tumor cells and non-malignant cells expressing these targets within the tumor microenvironment (TME), thereby reverting the TME from an immune-hostile to an immune-friendly environment and potentially upregulating PD-L1 expression to sensitize tumors to anti-PD-1 therapy.\n\nIn this non-randomized, open-label, single-center phase 1/2 study, patients received the vaccine subcutaneously biweekly for the first six administrations and thereafter every 4 weeks (up to 15 vaccines). Nivolumab was administered in parallel (intravenously) for up to 2 years. The study included three cohorts: aPD1 therapy-naive patients (Cohort A), aPD1 therapy-refractory patients (Cohort B), and patients with acquired resistance (Cohort C). Primary endpoints included safety and feasibility, while secondary endpoints assessed immunogenicity (vaccine-specific T cell responses) and clinical efficacy (ORR, PFS, OS) according to RECIST 1.1."
