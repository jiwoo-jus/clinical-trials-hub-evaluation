      "briefSummary": "The GANGLIA-AF trial hypothesized that ablating the ectopy-triggering ganglionated plexuses (ET-GPs) prevents atrial fibrillation (AF). This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, 3-center trial comparing GP ablation (GPA) without pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) against PVI in patients with paroxysmal AF. The primary endpoint was documented atrial arrhythmia lasting 30 seconds or more after a 3-month blanking period.",
      "detailedDescription": "Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is the standard ablation technique for atrial fibrillation (AF), but success rates vary. This study investigated the role of intrinsic cardiac autonomic system ganglionated plexuses (GPs) in AF. Specifically, it targeted ectopy-triggering GPs (ET-GPs) identified via high-frequency stimulation (HFS). \n\nGANGLIA-AF (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02487654) was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, single-blinded clinical study. Patients with paroxysmal AF indicated for ablation were randomized to either PVI or GPA without PVI. In the GPA arm, ET-GPs were mapped using HFS delivered within the atrial refractory period and ablated until nonfunctional. If triggered AF became incessant, atrioventricular dissociating GPs (AVD-GPs) were also mapped and ablated. The PVI arm underwent standard wide antral circumferential ablation.\n\nFollow-up occurred for 12 months, including 3-monthly 48-hour Holter monitors. The primary endpoint was documented atrial arrhythmia (AF, atrial tachycardia, or atrial flutter) ≥30 seconds after a 3-month blanking period. Secondary endpoints included repeat ablation, mortality, complications, and reduction in antiarrhythmic drug usage."
