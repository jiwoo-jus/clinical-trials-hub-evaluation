      "briefSummary": "HERALD is a randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 2b/3 clinical trial conducted in 47 centres in ten countries in Europe and Latin America. The study aimed to analyse the efficacy and safety of the CVnCoV SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine candidate. Adults with no history of virologically confirmed COVID-19 were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intramuscularly either two 0.6 mL doses of CVnCoV containing 12 μg of mRNA or two 0.6 mL doses of 0.9% NaCl (placebo) on days 1 and 29. The primary efficacy endpoint was the occurrence of a first episode of virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 of any severity from 15 days after the second dose.",
      "detailedDescription": "The trial utilized an interactive web response system with stratification by country and age group (18–60 years and ≥61 years). The initial phase 2b part of the trial was designed to characterise the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of the CVnCoV vaccine candidate, while the phase 3 part was designed to evaluate its efficacy and safety. CVnCoV is a chemically unmodified mRNA vaccine candidate based on the RNActive mRNA vaccine platform encoding the stabilised, full-length, native SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Primary safety outcomes were solicited local and systemic adverse events within 7 days after each dose and unsolicited adverse events within 28 days after each dose in phase 2b participants, as well as serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest up to 1 year after the second dose in all participants. Key secondary endpoints included the occurrence of a first episode of virologically confirmed moderate-to-severe COVID-19, severe COVID-19, and COVID-19 of any severity by age group."
