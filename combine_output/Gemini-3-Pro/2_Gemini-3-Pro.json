      "briefSummary": "This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of dasiglucagon, a next-generation ready-to-use glucagon analog in an aqueous formulation, for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in adults with type 1 diabetes. In this randomized, double-blind trial, 170 adult participants were assigned to receive either 0.6 mg dasiglucagon, placebo, or 1 mg reconstituted glucagon during insulin-induced hypoglycemia. The primary goal was to determine if dasiglucagon is superior to placebo in recovery time, defined as an increase of ≥20 mg/dL in plasma glucose without rescue intervention.",
      "detailedDescription": "This phase 3 trial employed a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group design conducted in an inpatient clinical research setting across Germany, Austria, the U.S., and Canada. Participants were adults (18-75 years) with type 1 diabetes on stable insulin therapy. The study aimed to demonstrate the superiority of a single subcutaneous dose of 0.6 mg dasiglucagon over placebo, with 1.0 mg reconstituted lyophilized glucagon included as a reference.\n\nParticipants underwent insulin induction to achieve controlled hypoglycemia (target plasma glucose of 55 mg/dL). Once glucose levels dropped below 60 mg/dL, trial medication was administered subcutaneously. The primary endpoint was time to plasma glucose recovery, defined as the first increase in plasma glucose of ≥20 mg/dL from baseline without rescue intravenous glucose. Key secondary endpoints included plasma glucose recovery within specific timeframes (10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes) and the magnitude of plasma glucose change from baseline. Safety assessments included monitoring for adverse events, specifically nausea and vomiting, and immunogenicity (anti-drug antibodies)."
