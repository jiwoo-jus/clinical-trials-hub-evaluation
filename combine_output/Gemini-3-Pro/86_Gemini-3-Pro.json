      "briefSummary": "This phase 3 randomized clinical trial, known as the ARTISTS 2 study, investigated the safety and effectiveness of fixed doses of deutetrabenazine (up to 48 mg per day) compared to placebo for the treatment of tics associated with Tourette syndrome in children and adolescents. The study aimed to determine if deutetrabenazine could reduce tic severity over an 8-week treatment period.",
      "detailedDescription": "The ARTISTS 2 study was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose clinical trial conducted at 52 sites in 10 countries. Eligible participants were children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years with a diagnosis of Tourette syndrome and active tics causing distress or impairment. Participants were randomized (1:1:1) to receive high-dose deutetrabenazine (up to 48 mg/d), low-dose deutetrabenazine (up to 36 mg/d), or a matching placebo. Dosing was determined based on body weight and CYP2D6 status, consisting of a 4-week titration period followed by a 4-week maintenance period.\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to week 8 in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale–Total Tic Score (YGTSS-TTS) for high-dose deutetrabenazine compared with placebo. Key secondary endpoints included changes in YGTSS-TTS for low-dose deutetrabenazine, Tourette Syndrome Clinical Global Impression score, Tourette Syndrome Patient Global Impression of Impact score, and Child and Adolescent Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome–Quality of Life Activities of Daily Living subscale score. Safety assessments included incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, laboratory parameters, vital signs, and specific questionnaires for depression and suicidality."
