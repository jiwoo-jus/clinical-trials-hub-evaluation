      "briefSummary": "This study, known as the ISOCRATE trial, evaluated whether the rate of rewarming after targeted temperature management (TTM) affects systemic inflammation in patients who remained comatose after shockable out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The researchers compared two rewarming rates: a slower rate of 0.25 °C/h versus a faster rate of 0.50 °C/h, after patients had been maintained at 33 °C for 24 hours. The primary hypothesis was that slower rewarming would lead to lower serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL6), a marker of inflammation.",
      "detailedDescription": "The ISOCRATe (Impact of Speed Of rewarming after CaRdiac ArresT(e)) trial was a single-center, randomized controlled trial conducted in a medical-surgical ICU in France. It aimed to assess the impact of rewarming rates on post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS) inflammation markers.\n\nParticipants were adults (18 years or older) who were unconscious (GCS score <= 8) after OHCA with a shockable rhythm and received TTM at 33 °C using a closed-loop cooling device (Artic Sun). Patients were randomized 18-24 hours after reaching 33 °C to ensure survival through the induction/maintenance phase. They were allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either the 0.25 °C/h or 0.50 °C/h rewarming rate group.\n\nThe primary outcome measured was the serum IL6 level (calculated as area-under-the-curve) 24–48 hours after reaching the target temperature of 33 °C. Secondary outcomes included day-90 Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scores, neurofilament light-chain (NF-L) levels at 48 hours, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels, mortality, and other inflammatory biomarkers (IL2, IL4, IL8, IL10, GM-CSF, TNFα, CRP, and procalcitonin)."
