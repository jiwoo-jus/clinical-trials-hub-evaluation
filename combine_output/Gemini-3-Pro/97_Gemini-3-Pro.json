      "briefSummary": "The JUVE-BRIGHT study is a multicenter, open-label, active-controlled phase 3 clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of baricitinib, an oral selective Janus kinase (JAK) 1 and 2 inhibitor, in pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 18 years. The study specifically targets patients with active juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis (JIA-uveitis) or chronic anterior antinuclear antibody (ANA)-positive uveitis who have had an inadequate response to standard therapies such as methotrexate or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). The trial utilizes a Bayesian design to compare baricitinib against adalimumab (an active control) or to treat patients with baricitinib directly, aimed at addressing the unmet medical need in this population.",
      "detailedDescription": "This multicenter, phase 3 trial employs an open-label Bayesian design to assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of baricitinib in children and adolescents with JIA-uveitis or chronic ANA-positive uveitis without systemic features. The study aims to enroll between 20 and 40 patients aged 2 to <18 years who have active anterior uveitis despite prior treatment with topical steroids and methotrexate (MTX). \n\nParticipants will be categorized based on their treatment history. At least 20 patients with an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate (MTX-IR), but who are naive to biologic DMARDs, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either open-label baricitinib or adalimumab. Approximately 20 additional patients who are MTX-IR or have had an inadequate response to bDMARDs will be assigned to receive baricitinib treatment. \n\nInterventions are dosed as follows: \n1. Baricitinib: Administered orally once daily at a fixed dose by age group (2 mg for patients <6 years; 4 mg for patients ≥6 to <18 years). \n2. Adalimumab: Administered as a subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks (20 mg for patients weighing <30 kg; 40 mg for patients weighing ≥30 kg).\n\nThe study consists of two parts: Part A includes screening and a treatment period up to Week 24, and Part B is a long-term open-label extension (OLE) allowing treatment for up to 5 years. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients achieving response at Week 24, defined according to the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) criteria as a 2-step decrease in the level of inflammation (anterior chamber cells) or a decrease to zero in the most severely affected eye. Secondary endpoints include visual acuity changes, vitreous haze assessment, flare grades, and corticosteroid tapering capabilities. A Bayesian analysis will be conducted at interim analyses and the end of the study to determine efficacy or futility."
