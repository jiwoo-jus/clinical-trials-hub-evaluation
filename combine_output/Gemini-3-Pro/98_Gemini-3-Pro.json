      "briefSummary": "CAPTIVATE (NCT02910583) is a randomized phase II study evaluating minimal residual disease (MRD)-guided treatment discontinuation following completion of first-line ibrutinib plus venetoclax treatment in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). The study investigates whether fixed-duration treatment with this all-oral, chemotherapy-free regimen is feasible based on deep remission status.",
      "detailedDescription": "Eligible patients aged < 70 years with previously untreated CLL or SLL received three cycles of single-agent ibrutinib lead-in followed by 12 cycles of combined ibrutinib plus venetoclax. Following this treatment phase, patients in the MRD cohort were assessed for Confirmed undetectable MRD (uMRD). Patients meeting the stringent criteria for Confirmed uMRD were randomly assigned 1:1 to double-blind treatment with placebo or ibrutinib. Patients who did not meet Confirmed uMRD criteria (uMRD Not Confirmed) were randomly assigned 1:1 to open-label treatment with single-agent ibrutinib or continued ibrutinib plus venetoclax. The primary endpoint was the 1-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate with placebo versus ibrutinib in the Confirmed uMRD population. Secondary endpoints included undetectable MRD rates in peripheral blood and bone marrow, overall response rates, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety."
