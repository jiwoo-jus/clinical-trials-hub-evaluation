      "briefSummary": "Gait difficulties in Parkinson’s disease are often related to problems shifting the center of gravity forward. This study tested whether repeated prism adaptation—specifically adaptation to upward visual shifts—could improve gait and postural control in people with Parkinson’s disease. In a parallel, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial, participants underwent two weeks of twice-daily prism adaptation or sham treatment to determine if the intervention resulted in functional benefits in posture, gait, and activities of daily living.",
      "detailedDescription": "Participants with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease meeting specific clinical criteria (Hoehn and Yahr Stage II.5–IV, gait/stability deficits on MDS-UPDRS, or Timed Up and Go > 12s) were recruited for this double-blind randomized controlled trial. Participants were allocated to two weeks of twice-daily home-based training involving pointing movements to visual targets while wearing goggles. The intervention group used goggles with Fresnel lenses inducing a 25-dioptre (~17°) upward shift (real treatment), while the control group used goggles with no shift (sham treatment).\n\nOutcomes were assessed immediately before and after the 14-day treatment period, with further long-term postal follow-up at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months. The primary outcomes focused on changes in postural control measured using the Berg Balance Scale and mechanized measures from the Smart EquiTest Balance Master System (Limits of Stability, Sensory Organization, and Motor Control tests). Secondary outcomes included the Timed Up and Go test, Functional Gait Assessment, steady-state gait analysis, and self-report questionnaires including the New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire, Falls Efficacy Scale, Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, and the Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire 39."
