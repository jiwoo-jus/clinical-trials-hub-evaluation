      "briefSummary": "This study evaluates the impact of an interactive (two-way) short messaging service (SMS) communication intervention, Mobile Solutions for Neonatal Health (Mobile WACh NEO), on neonatal mortality in Kenya. The intervention focuses on the perinatal period, sending automated tailored SMS messages to mothers during pregnancy and up to 6 weeks post partum. The messages utilize the Information-Motivation-Behaviour Skills framework to promote essential newborn care, identification of neonatal danger signs, care-seeking, and maternal social support. The study compares this intervention to standard care in a randomized controlled trial involving 5000 pregnant women.",
      "detailedDescription": "The Mobile WACh NEO study is a multisite, two-arm, 1:1 individually randomised, parallel group, superiority randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted at six healthcare facilities in Kenya, including both rural and urban locations. The primary objective is to determine the effect of the interactive SMS messaging intervention on neonatal mortality, defined as death within the first 28 days of life.\n\nParticipants are pregnant women enrolled at 28–36 weeks estimated gestational age who have access to a mobile phone. They are randomised to either the intervention arm (two-way SMS) or the control arm (standard of care with no SMS). The intervention involves a series of automated SMS messages tailored to the participant's gestational age or time since delivery. The curriculum is grounded in the Information-Motivation-Behavioural Skills (IMB) model. Participants can also initiate SMS communication with study nurses for on-demand support. Specialized message tracks are available for high-risk groups, including first-time mothers, adolescents, women with elevated depression symptoms, and mothers of preterm or low birth weight infants.\n\nSecondary objectives include determining the effect of the intervention on maternal implementation of essential newborn care (ENC) practices (such as breastfeeding, cord care, and thermal care), care-seeking behavior, and maternal psychosocial health (social support, self-efficacy, and depression). Data collection occurs at enrolment, 2 weeks post partum, and 6 weeks post partum through questionnaires and clinic record abstraction."
