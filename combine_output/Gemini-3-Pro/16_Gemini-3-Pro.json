      "briefSummary": "This double-blinded, phase 2 randomized, controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma (CCP) for preventing infection in exposed, uninfected individuals. The researchers hypothesized that CCP might prevent infection when administered before symptoms or laboratory evidence of infection appear. The study enrolled asymptomatic participants aged 18 years or older who had close contact exposure to a person with confirmed COVID-19 within the previous 120 hours.",
      "detailedDescription": "The study was conducted as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to compare the safety and efficacy of transfusion of high titer (≥1:320) CCP (intervention) with SARS-CoV-2 non-immune control plasma. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 1 unit of CCP or 1 unit of control plasma using interactive web-based systems. The primary efficacy outcome was incident SARS-CoV-2 infection by study day 28, confirmed by positive RT-PCR testing on nasal swabs. Secondary efficacy outcomes included disease severity measured by a clinical event scale and efficacy based on donor antibody titer characterization. Safety assessments monitored adverse events, serious adverse events, and transfusion reactions. The trial aimed to determine the utility of CCP as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptomatic COVID-19."
