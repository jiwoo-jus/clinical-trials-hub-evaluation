      "briefSummary": "This Phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of trazpiroben (TAK-906) in healthy Japanese men. Trazpiroben is a peripherally selective dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist being developed for the treatment of chronic gastroparesis. The study assessed single and multiple oral doses of the drug compared to placebo. Findings were compared with those from a prior US trial in healthy individuals to evaluate potential ethnic differences in the drug's disposition and safety profile.",
      "detailedDescription": "This study was designed as a phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single- and multiple-ascending dose, parallel-group analysis. The primary objective was to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of trazpiroben administered as single and multiple doses in healthy male Japanese participants. The study design was consistent with a prior US study (AT-01C) to allow for informal comparison between the two populations.\n\nA total of 24 participants were enrolled and divided into three cohorts (n = 8 per cohort). In each cohort, 6 participants received trazpiroben and 2 received placebo. The dosing regimen was as follows:\n- Cohort 1: 50 mg\n- Cohort 2: 100 mg\n- Cohort 3: 10 mg\n\nParticipants received a single dose of the blinded study drug on Day 1 (single-dose phase). This was followed by multiple doses administered twice daily for 5 days from Day 3 through Day 7 (multiple-dose phase), with no evening dose on Day 7. Follow-up assessments occurred on Day 14.\n\nSafety evaluations included monitoring of adverse events (AEs), physical examinations, vital signs, and standard 12-lead ECG parameters. PK analysis involved the collection of blood and urine samples to quantify trazpiroben and its metabolite, M23, using LC-MS/MS methods. Parameters assessed included AUC, Cmax, tmax, and elimination half-life. PD analysis utilized serum prolactin concentrations as a biomarker for dopamine D2 receptor antagonism, measuring AUC and Cmax of prolactin levels."
