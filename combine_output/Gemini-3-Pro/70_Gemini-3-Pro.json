      "briefSummary": "This study, titled SKIPPAIN, evaluated the efficacy and safety of secukinumab 150 mg compared with placebo in the management of spinal pain and disease activity in patients with active axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). The primary goal was to assess the superiority of secukinumab in achieving a significant reduction in spinal pain (average spinal pain score <4) by Week 8, with further evaluation of sustained improvement and safety up to Week 24.",
      "detailedDescription": "SKIPPAIN is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study designed to assess secukinumab in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), including both radiographic (r-axSpA) and non-radiographic (nr-axSpA) forms. Eligible patients were adults with active spinal disease defined by a BASDAI score ≥4 and an average spinal pain score >4, who had an inadequate response to NSAIDs.\n\nThe study consisted of two periods. In Treatment Period 1 (TP1), patients were randomized (3:1) to receive either secukinumab 150 mg (Group A) or placebo (Group B) from baseline to Week 8. At Week 8, patients entered Treatment Period 2 (TP2). Responders in Group A (average spinal pain score <4) continued on secukinumab 150 mg. Non-responders in Group A were re-randomized to either continue secukinumab 150 mg or escalate to 300 mg (up-titration). Patients in the placebo group were re-randomized to receive secukinumab 150 mg or 300 mg. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving an average spinal pain score <4 on a 0–10 numerical rating scale (NRS) at Week 8. Secondary endpoints included BASDAI scores and safety assessments."
