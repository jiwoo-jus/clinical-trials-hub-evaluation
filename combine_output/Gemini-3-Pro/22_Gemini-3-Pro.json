      "briefSummary": "This open-label pilot study investigated the efficacy and safety of a very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD), specifically known as Nic's Ketogenic Diet, over a period of 140 days. The study focused on healthy adults with mildly elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The primary objective was to assess changes in cardiometabolic markers, body composition, and weight loss. The hypothesis was that the diet would induce beneficial changes in these parameters without causing significant adverse effects.",
      "detailedDescription": "The study involved 14 eligible participants aged 30 to 55 with a BMI of 20.0–29.9 kg/m2 and LDL-C levels between 2.5 and 4.1 mmol/L. Participants followed Nic's Ketogenic Diet, which provided 5% of calories from carbohydrates, 70% from fat, and 25% from protein, for 140 days. \n\nAssessments were conducted at Day 0, 28, 56, 70, 84, 112, and 140. Key measurements included weight, blood pressure (BP), and fasting plasma lipids at all visits. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans for body composition (body fat %, android fat, gynoid fat, muscle mass) were performed on Day 0, 70, and 140. Additional blood markers such as glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), C-reactive protein (CRP), free triiodothyronine (T3), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were measured at baseline and Day 140.\n\nParticipants monitored compliance through weekly 3-day food records, daily ketone and glucose monitoring, and regular counseling with a Registered Dietitian. Safety was evaluated through adverse event reporting, electrocardiograms, and clinical chemistry panels."
