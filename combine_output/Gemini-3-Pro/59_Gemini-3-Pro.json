      "briefSummary": "The aim of this study is to compare daily weight monitoring and physical activity behavior adherence by older adults using a sensor-controlled digital game (SCDG) intervention versus a sensors-only intervention in a feasibility randomized controlled trial. The innovative SCDG integrates data from sensors to trigger game rewards, progress, and feedback based on the real-time behaviors of individuals with heart failure (HF).",
      "detailedDescription": "This prospective feasibility randomized controlled trial (1:1) involved two parallel groups: a sensors-only control group and a sensors plus SCDG app intervention group. The study recruited English-speaking adults with HF aged 55 years or older. Both groups utilized Withings Go activity trackers and Withings Body smart weighing scales to track behaviors for 12 weeks. The intervention group used an app called Heart Health Mountain, an SCDG guided by the Fogg behavioral model, where game rewards and feedback were triggered by real-time sensor data regarding weight monitoring and physical activity. The study assessed feasibility outcomes including recruitment, retention, engagement, and satisfaction. Additionally, it compared participants' knowledge, functional status (using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire), quality of life, self-reported HF behaviors, motivation, and HF-related hospitalization between groups at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 weeks."
