      "briefSummary": "This study is a three-arm randomized controlled trial evaluating the mLab App, a mobile health intervention designed to increase HIV testing rates and linkage to care among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and young transgender women (YTGW). Focusing on Black and Latino youth in New York City and Chicago, the study compares the mLab App (which includes testing reminders and an image interpretation feature for at-home tests) against standard of care and a home-test-only control group.",
      "detailedDescription": "The trial enrolls participants aged 18–29 years who are randomized into one of three arms: Arm 1 receives the mLab App, HIV home test kits, and standard of preventive care; Arm 2 receives standard of preventive care only; and Arm 3 receives HIV home test kits and standard of preventive care. The mLab App is an FDA-regulated investigational device that allows users to upload photos of OraQuick rapid home HIV self-tests for automated result interpretation and provides automated notifications to encourage testing every 3 months.\n\nThe study aims to address disparities in HIV testing caused by social and healthcare barriers, such as stigma and lack of access. Recruitment is conducted via social media and community partners. The primary outcome is the proportion of participants self-reporting HIV testing in the past 6 months. Secondary outcomes include linkage to care for those with reactive tests and the performance of the app's image processing algorithm. Data is collected at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months post-enrollment."
