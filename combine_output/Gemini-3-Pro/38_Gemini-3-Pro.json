      "briefSummary": "IPATunity130 Cohort B is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial investigating the efficacy and safety of ipatasertib combined with paclitaxel compared to placebo plus paclitaxel. The study specifically targets patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered, hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative unresectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who are candidates for taxane monotherapy.",
      "detailedDescription": "The study evaluates the addition of ipatasertib, a selective AKT inhibitor, to standard paclitaxel chemotherapy in patients with advanced breast cancer exhibiting PI3K/AKT pathway alterations. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive oral ipatasertib (400 mg on days 1–21) or placebo, combined with intravenous paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15) every 28 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Eligible participants had HR+/HER2-negative disease with documented PIK3CA, AKT1, or PTEN alterations and were considered inappropriate for endocrine-based therapy. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS), with secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety outcomes."
