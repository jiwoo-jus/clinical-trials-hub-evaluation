All participants first completed a ~14-day run-in period using the study pump and CGM as a sensor-augmented pump (SAP) with or without predictive low glucose management (PLGM) or automated basal delivery (Auto Basal) only, without automated correction boluses. This was followed by a ~90-day study phase in which both automated basal insulin delivery (Auto Basal) and automated bolus correction (Auto Correction) were enabled. During the study phase, each participant used one glucose target (100 or 120 mg/dL) for approximately 45 days and then switched to the other target for approximately 45 days. Active insulin time (AIT) settings could be adjusted per protocol to explore optimization of glycemic control.",

The system provides automated basal insulin delivery (Auto Basal) and automated correction bolus insulin delivery (Auto Correction) every 5 minutes, including a meal detection module (DreaMed Diabetes technology) that can trigger more aggressive auto-correction boluses when appropriate. Users can select glucose targets of 100 or 120 mg/dL, with an optional temporary target of 150 mg/dL, and configure active insulin time (AIT). During the run-in period, the same hardware was used as a sensor-augmented pump with or without predictive low glucose management or Auto Basal only. During the study phase, both Auto Basal and Auto Correction were enabled for approximately 90 days.",
