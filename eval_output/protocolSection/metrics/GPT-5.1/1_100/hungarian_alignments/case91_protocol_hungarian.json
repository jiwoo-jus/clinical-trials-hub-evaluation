Psoriasis relapse is defined as loss of ≥ 50% of the initial Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) improvement measured at Week 12. This occurs if the participant obtains a PASI score at any evaluation during the specified time interval that is ≥ Week 12 PASI + \\[(Baseline PASI -Week 12 PASI)/2\\]). Participants who terminated early from the study due to reasons other than psoriasis relapse or worsening psoriasis (drop-outs) were censored at the time of drop-out. PASI is an assessment for psoriasis severity based on 4 body areas: Head and Neck, Upper Extremities, Trunk, and Lower Extremities. Psoriasis severity within each body area is assessed for Redness (score 0-4), Thickness (score 0-4) and Scaling (score 0-4). Scores for each body area are summed and weighted by the affected Body Surface Area (score 0-6) to produce the total score. The score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis present) to 72 (very severe psoriasis).",
