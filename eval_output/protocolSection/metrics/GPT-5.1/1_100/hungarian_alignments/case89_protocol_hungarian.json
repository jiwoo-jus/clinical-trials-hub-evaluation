Patients receive dual antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg daily for at least 3 days before the procedure. Under general anesthesia, after arterial access and placement of 6- or 8-French guiding catheters, intravenous heparin is administered to maintain activated clotting time between 200 and 300 seconds. A microguidewire and microcatheter are used to traverse the occluded intracranial artery segment, with angiographic confirmation of true lumen position. Balloon angioplasty is then performed; stents are deployed in cases of significant residual stenosis, dissection, or failure to maintain forward flow, with allowance for multiple stents if needed. Successful revascularization is defined as modified TICI 2b or 3 and residual stenosis <50%. Post-procedure, if no hemorrhage is seen on CT, intravenous anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is continued for 24–48 hours, followed by dual antiplatelet therapy for 3–6 months and then lifelong single antiplatelet therapy.",
