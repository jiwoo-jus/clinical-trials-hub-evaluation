Each protocol includes: (1) narrative messages derived from quotations and microstories from the chosen Veteran’s transcript, crafted to preserve the Veteran’s voice while using standard spelling; (2) nonnarrative educational messages based on American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and CDC guidance, each aligned with key hypertension self-management content areas (e.g., reducing salt, taking medications, physical activity); and (3) 2-way interactive messages that query self-efficacy and behavior (e.g., days per week a behavior was performed), using fixed response codes (e.g., NA1–NA3, ACT0–ACT7, CONF1–CONF3) and sending automated tailored feedback plus links to educational and VA resources. The 26‑week structure consists of repeated 2‑week blocks per content area (first week primarily educational texts, second week narrative texts), with salt intake and medication adherence blocks repeated, and check-in weeks composed entirely of interactive messages.",
