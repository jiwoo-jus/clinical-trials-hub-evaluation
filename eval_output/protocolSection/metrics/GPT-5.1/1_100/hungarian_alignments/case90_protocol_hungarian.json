If emotional health was rated as excellent/very good/good, they received a positive feedback text and a link to a library of brief psychoeducational videos about mental health self‑care during college. If emotional health was rated as fair/poor, they were sent a link to a brief web-based check‑in to report current stressors, negative effects, and their self-efficacy in managing these issues. Based on these responses, the system sent tailored self‑management support messages drawn from positive psychology, cognitive behavioral therapy, and dialectical behavioral therapy skills, plus links to relevant psychoeducational videos. Check‑in frequency was adapted to need: high self‑efficacy led to less frequent (monthly) check‑ins, whereas low self‑efficacy triggered weekly follow‑ups, repeated tailoring, and prompts to consider seeking professional mental health care (with resource links) if low self‑efficacy persisted. Participants could opt out at any time by texting “Quit.” All participants in this arm also received access to the psychoeducational video library and completed monthly web-based outcome questionnaires.",
