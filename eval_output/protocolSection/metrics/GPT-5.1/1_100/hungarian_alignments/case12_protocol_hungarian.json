The COVID-19-adapted FLU-PRO Plus was used. It is a questionnaire that assesses the severity of symptoms in participants with COVID-19 across six body systems: nose, throat, eyes, chest/respiratory, gastrointestinal, and body/systemic. Each domain scores range from 0 (symptom free) to 4 (very severe symptoms). A higher score indicates increased symptom severity. Alleviation is defined as symptom scores of 0 (absent) or 1 (mild).",
