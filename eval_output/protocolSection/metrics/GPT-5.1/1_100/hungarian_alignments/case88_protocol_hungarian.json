Participants used a patient-facing smartphone/tablet app for 90 days post-discharge, which provided a personalized daily health checklist including education, medication and step/physical activity tracking, reminders, interactive surveys and articles, and two-way messaging with non-clinician live health coaches. Engagement and clinical outcomes (readmissions, cardiac rehabilitation enrollment, and cardiology follow-up) were assessed.",
