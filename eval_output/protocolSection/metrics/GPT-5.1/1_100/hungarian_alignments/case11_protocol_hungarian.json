It is based on behavioral economics (defaults, accountability, precommitment) and user-centred design. Using computable phenotypes, it identifies five patient types: (1) CKD with uncontrolled systolic blood pressure who are candidates to start an ACE inhibitor; (2) CKD with uncontrolled systolic blood pressure who are candidates to start an ARB; (3) CKD patients on an ACE inhibitor at a suboptimal dose; (4) CKD patients on an ARB at a suboptimal dose; and (5) CKD patients maximized on ACEi/ARB but not on a diuretic. For eligible encounters, a Best Practice Advisory appears at chart opening, displaying patient-specific data (labs, vitals, medications), explaining why the alert fired, suggesting evidence-based actions (e.g., start or uptitrate ACEi/ARB, add diuretic, order labs), and offering options to accept recommendations, defer to next visit, or document accountable justification when not following them. Hyperlinks to relevant hypertension and CKD guidelines are provided.",
