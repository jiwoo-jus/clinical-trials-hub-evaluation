For each positive GP site, clusters of radiofrequency lesions (30 W for 30 seconds, 25 W on the posterior wall; irrigation 17 mL/min; contact force >3 g) were delivered around the site. GPs were re‑tested with HFS and further ablated until nonfunctional. No pulmonary vein isolation was performed in this arm.",
