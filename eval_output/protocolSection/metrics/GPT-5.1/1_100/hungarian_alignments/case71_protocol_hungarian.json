It is designed to reduce overtreatment and promote Choosing Wisely guideline adherence by tailoring recommendations based on a life-expectancy algorithm. Components:\n\n1) Tailored Advisory: A noninterruptive in-encounter alert for Choosing Wisely–noncompliant patients that describes appropriate glycemic targets by life-expectancy category and suggests treatment changes. Clinicians may acknowledge by agreeing with the recommendation or indicating clinical inappropriateness with free-text justification, and can suppress future alerts for 182.5 days.\n\n2) Refill Protocol: An alert in the medication refills section whenever a diabetes medication refill is generated for eligible older adults. It suggests initiating metformin for those not on it or lowering/stopping refills for those already on metformin, with optional comments.\n\n3) Preference List: A system-level default medication order set in Epic where metformin is placed at the top of the \"First-line Type 2 Diabetes\" medication list, while preserving the ability to order other agents without restriction.\n\n4) Lab Result Nudge: An alert in the lab results section that appears when a new HbA1c result is available for a Choosing Wisely–noncompliant patient, showing appropriate treatment guidelines and highlighting out-of-range values. The alert remains active for 7 days after the result posts.\n\n5) Peer Comparison Email: A monthly secure email from the practice director’s account showing graphical peer-comparison feedback: the individual clinician’s Choosing Wisely compliance, their site’s compliance, and overall NYULH compliance. The message text is framed positively or negatively depending on whether the clinician’s performance is above or below their practice average.\n\n6) Campaign Email Toolkit: A monthly gamified educational campaign delivered outside the EHR (e.g., game-show–themed animations modeled on The Price is Right, Jeopardy, and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, plus flashcards) that quizzes clinicians on Choosing Wisely best practices, tailored by life-expectancy category.",
