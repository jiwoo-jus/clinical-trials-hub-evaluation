During the Implementation phase, providers also receive access to recorded training materials and resources on an ATTC website, a weekly CM newsletter, and performance feedback via the CM Tracker tool (self‑rated CM fidelity and automated summaries). Monthly CM consultation calls are provided, but without higher‑level implementation facilitation. In the Sustainment phase, no active project supports are provided beyond continued access to previously supplied materials.

The enhanced elements are: (1) Pay‑for‑Performance: during the Implementation phase, CM counselors earn monetary bonuses contingent on achieving performance benchmarks, specifically US $200 for each newly admitted study patient who receives 10 or more CM sessions within 14 weeks (CM Exposure) and US $50 per month when their mean CM Competence Scale score is ≥ 5.8 (stretch goal for high CM skill). (2) Implementation & Sustainment Facilitation: starting in month 3 of Preparation and continuing through Implementation, OTP leaders and CM counselors participate in monthly 30–60‑minute facilitated strategy meetings (plus an optional 2‑hour CM process walkthrough). A trained external facilitator uses a structured workbook and exercises (e.g., decisional balance, implementation climate evaluation, performance review and planning) to engage staff, address barriers, strengthen implementation climate and leadership engagement, and develop plans for sustaining CM, including strategies to secure financial support for incentives. All OTPs in this arm implement the same prize‑based CM attendance protocol as an adjunct to methadone or buprenorphine treatment.",
