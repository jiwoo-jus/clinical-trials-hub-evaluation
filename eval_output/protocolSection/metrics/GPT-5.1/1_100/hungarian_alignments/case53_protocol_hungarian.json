For days 22-28, after a brief mindfulness training, every detected or self-reported smoking event triggers an SMS link to a 2-minute guided mindful smoking exercise, while smartband monitoring and notifications continue.

From day 30 to day 60, a 2-minute guided RAIN (recognize, allow, investigate, nonidentification) mindfulness exercise is delivered via SMS at predicted smoking times based on the first 21 days of smartband data, with a 45-minute cooldown between messages; the exercise can also be accessed on demand. During this phase, mindful smoking links continue to be sent after detected or reported smoking events, and the smartband continues to monitor and notify about smoking.",
