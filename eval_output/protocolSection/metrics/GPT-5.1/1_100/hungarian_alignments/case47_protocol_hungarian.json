During the exploration of the options for a particular goal, collaborative performance analysis is used. The coach follows the four steps to (a) identify parents' perception of what currently happens, (b) identify what they would like to happen, (c) explore barriers and bridges to the desired performance, and (d) identify their needs for taking actions to achieve goals. Parents are guided to find strategies to facilitate their child's performance to support goal achievement.",
