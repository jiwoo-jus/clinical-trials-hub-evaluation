In this work, TM was used as an anti-metastatic agent in high-risk breast cancer. In mouse models it was administered via drinking water at 0.7 mg/day; in vitro it was used at low micromolar or nanomolar concentrations (e.g., 0.5 μM) that deplete copper without affecting viability. In the referenced phase II clinical trial (NCT00195091), TM was given orally in repeated 4‑week cycles with dose titrated to reduce ceruloplasmin and maintain copper at ~30% of baseline.",
