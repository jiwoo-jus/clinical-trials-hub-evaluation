Messages are tailored by gestational age or time since delivery, language (English, Kiswahili, or Dholuo), and risk category (e.g., first-time/≤19 years, elevated depression, preterm/low-birth-weight infant, or pregnancy/infant loss). From enrollment to 38 weeks, weekly SMS focus on facility delivery, birth planning, neonatal danger signs, and emotional support. From 38 weeks to delivery, daily SMS emphasize identification of neonatal danger signs and essential newborn care (ENC) practices (immediate and exclusive breastfeeding, thermal and cord care). From delivery to 2 weeks postpartum, two messages per day are sent: one with screening questions for neonatal danger signs and prompting contact with nurses, and one with educational and psychosocial content. From 2 to 6 weeks postpartum, messages are sent every other day. Participants can send SMS at any time to study nurses, who respond during business hours using a human–computer hybrid platform, triage clinical concerns, and refer participants to facility care when danger signs or serious issues are reported. All SMS sending/receiving is free to participants; standard Ministry of Health antenatal and maternal–child health services continue as usual.",

Message frequency varies by period (weekly, then daily, then twice daily, then every other day). Participants can freely text nurses, who respond via a web-based platform using standardized and customized replies, triage maternal and neonatal danger signs, and refer participants to health facilities or local support resources as needed.
