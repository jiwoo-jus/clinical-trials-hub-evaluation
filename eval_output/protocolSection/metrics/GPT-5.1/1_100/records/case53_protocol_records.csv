One hundred adults who smoke at least 5 cigarettes per day and are motivated to quit wear a smartband for 60 days. For the first 21 days, the band monitors and detects smoking and notifies participants to increase awareness of their smoking patterns and triggers. For the next 7 days, a brief ""mindful smoking"" exercise is sent whenever smoking is detected or manually reported. Around a quit date set at day 30, a brief mindfulness exercise called RAIN (recognize, allow, investigate, nonidentification) is delivered at times when smoking is predicted based on earlier tracking data to help participants work mindfully with cravings instead of smoking.

GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"This study will test the feasibility of using a smartband to detect and track smoking and deliver brief smoking cessation interventions by smartphone app in real time. Smokers will wear a smartband to detect and notify them of smoking for 21 days and obtain individual smoking profiles; detected smoking will then trigger a ""mindful smoking"" exercise for the next 7 days leading up to their quit date at 30 days; after which another mindfulness exercise (""RAIN"": recognize, accept, investigate and note cravings rather than smoke) will be delivered prior to each predicted smoking episode according to their individual smoking profile for 30 days post-quit.","This is a single-arm, 60-day feasibility clinical trial evaluating the use of wearable and smartphone technology to monitor and detect smoking and to deliver brief mindfulness-based interventions in real time among daily smokers making a quit attempt. The intervention leverages a smartband developed by Somatix, Inc., which uses accelerometer and gyroscope data and a machine learning algorithm to identify individual smoking-related hand-to-mouth gestures and distinguish them from other movements. When 3–4 puffs consistent with smoking are detected, the paired smartphone app prompts the user to confirm or deny smoking and allows manual reporting of any undetected smoking events.

A total of 100 adult participants (≥18 years) who smoke at least 5 cigarettes per day for at least 2 years, are fluent in English, own a compatible smartphone (iPhone or Android), and are motivated to quit (score ≥4 on a readiness-to-change item) are enrolled remotely following online recruitment (e.g., Facebook ads) and online informed consent. Participants are shipped a smartband and complete a video onboarding session to set up the device and app. They are instructed to wear the smartband for 12 waking hours per day over 60 days and to set a quit date at 30 days from study start.

The intervention has three sequential components:
1. **Monitoring and awareness (days 1–21):** The smartband automatically monitors and detects smoking and sends immediate notifications via vibration and smartphone alerts when smoking is detected, prompting participants to confirm or deny the event. Participants are instructed to manually log any smoking not detected by the band. This phase is intended to increase awareness of smoking frequency, context, and triggers and to generate individual smoking profiles. Data from this period form the basis for later prediction of likely smoking times.

2. **Mindful smoking (days 21–28):** After the day-21 survey, participants complete a brief mindfulness training adapted from the Craving to Quit app. This training introduces mindfulness and habit formation and provides a guided mindful smoking exercise designed to foster clear awareness of the immediate physical sensations, emotions, and thoughts associated with smoking, supporting the development of disenchantment with smoking. For the next 7 days, every detected or manually reported smoking event automatically triggers a text message with a link to a ~2-minute audio-guided mindful smoking exercise (with subtitles). Participants are instructed to use the exercise whenever they smoke but may access it at any time via SMS links. After each use, they rate how helpful they found the exercise on a visual analog scale (VAS).

3. **RAIN for cravings and predicted smoking events (days 30–60):** Following the day-28 survey, participants receive another brief mindfulness training, again adapted from Craving to Quit, focusing on cravings conceptualized as transient experiences (e.g., craving as a tantrum toddler) and introducing urge surfing. The RAIN (recognize, allow, investigate, nonidentification) mindfulness practice is taught to help participants observe cues, cravings, and affective states, accept them without judgment, investigate their bodily, emotional, and cognitive components, and avoid overidentifying with them. For 30 days following the quit date (~days 30–60), participants receive SMS links to a 2-minute audio-guided RAIN exercise at times predicted to be high-risk for smoking based on individualized smoking data from the initial 21 days. A prediction algorithm runs every 5 minutes and flags times for RAIN delivery if at least one smoking event was previously observed within 15 minutes of that time window over the first 21 days, with a 45-minute cooldown to minimize message burden. Before and after each RAIN exercise, participants rate current craving and affect (VAS scales), and afterward they additionally rate helpfulness and timing (too early/too late). During this period, the smartband continues to detect smoking and trigger mindful smoking exercises whenever smoking is detected or manually reported.

Adherence is supported through automated reminders if the band is worn less than 12 hours per day, additional SMS/email/phone reminders if non-wear persists 48–72 hours, and financial incentives for onboarding, survey completion (at days 21, 28, 60), daily wear, and overall completion. Encouraging SMS feedback summarizing the number of mindfulness exercises completed the prior day or week is sent during the mindful smoking week and throughout the first week and then weekly during the RAIN phase.

The **primary outcomes** are feasibility measures of treatment fidelity, adherence, and acceptability:
- **Treatment fidelity** includes: (a) the percentage of smoking events accurately detected by the smartband and the false alarm rate during days 1–21; (b) the percentage of mindful smoking exercises correctly triggered by smoking events and associated false alarm rates during days 21–28; and (c) the timeliness of RAIN delivery to predicted smoking events during days 30–60, assessed by participant timing ratings and craving levels prior to RAIN use as a proxy for targeting high-craving moments. Feasibility criteria include achieving high detection accuracy (aiming to replicate >80% detection and negligible false alarms) and at least 75% of participants rating timeliness and craving as moderate or higher.
- **Adherence** is measured by the proportion of days with ≥12 hours of smartband wear, the percentage of smoking notifications responded to (confirmed or denied), and the percentages of mindful smoking and RAIN exercises completed relative to those sent during their respective intervention periods. Based on preliminary data, an adherence cutoff of completing at least 80% of mindfulness exercises relative to baseline cigarettes per day is specified.
- **Acceptability** is assessed through mean helpfulness ratings (VAS) for mindful smoking and RAIN, evaluated as the proportion of participants with ratings in the moderate-to-very-high range (feasibility defined as ≥75% meeting this threshold). Additional acceptability and usability data are collected via User Experiences Questionnaires at days 21, 28, and 60, which cover ease of use of the technology, technical burden (e.g., charging, pairing), perceived helpfulness and liking of the mindfulness exercises, and perceived effects on awareness, cravings, and smoking. The 60-day questionnaire includes items adapted from the User Burden Scale, System Usability Scale, Mobile Application Rating Scale, and the 4-item Acceptability of Intervention Measure.

The **secondary outcomes** are smoking behavior and abstinence. Cigarettes per day are assessed by self-report at baseline, days 21, 28, and 60, and by smartband-detected events. Timeline Followback is used at each survey to capture day-by-day smoking between assessments. One-week point prevalence abstinence at day 60 is measured by self-report, by absence of smartband-detected smoking in the preceding 7 days, and by biochemical verification (carbon monoxide <6 ppm) in up to 30 self-reported abstinent participants using mailed piCO+ Smokerlyzer devices and remote video verification. Continuous abstinence (fewer than 5 cigarettes since quit date) is assessed by self-report.

Exploratory measures include demographics, smoking characteristics (e.g., Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence, Minnesota Tobacco Withdrawal Scale), dispositional mindfulness (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire short form), and in-intervention ecological momentary assessment ratings of craving and affect. Statistical analyses will primarily be descriptive for feasibility endpoints, with proportions and 95% confidence intervals. Changes in cigarettes per day will be examined using mixed regression models incorporating both self-reported and smartband-detected data, with model selection based on Bayesian information criterion. Exploratory mediation analyses will examine whether changes in craving, affect, mindfulness, and related psychological variables may mediate changes in smoking.

The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03995225). It is supported by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health and is intended to inform the design of future randomized efficacy trials of wearable- and smartphone-based mindfulness interventions for smoking cessation.",True,0.96,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
