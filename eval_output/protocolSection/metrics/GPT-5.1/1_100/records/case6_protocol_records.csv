Before surgery, each patient underwent CT-guided percutaneous microwave ablation of a single lung tumor, planned with the Emprint™ software to predict the expected ablation zone size and shape based on energy, time, and lung tissue characteristics. Immediate post-ablation CT scans were used to compare actual versus predicted ablation zones, and the resected specimens were examined histologically to determine whether complete tumor ablation (100% non-viable tumor cells by NADH staining) was achieved.

GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"Primary Endpoint: Dose response as indicated by CT imaging, measurement of maximum diameter and volume.

Secondary Endpoint: Assessment of complete tumor ablation immediately post-procedure.","This was a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, multicenter clinical investigation of the Emprint™ microwave ablation system used via a percutaneous approach in adults with primary or metastatic lung tumors that were already scheduled for surgical resection. The main goal was to assess the accuracy (dose response) of a CT-based procedure planning application that predicts microwave ablation zone size and shape in lung tissue, and to correlate imaging-based results with histologic evidence of tumor destruction.

Patients ≥18 years of age with either: (I) at least one pulmonary metastasis ≤3.0 cm in maximum diameter from a distant primary cancer, or (II) one primary lung cancer ≤3.0 cm in maximum diameter, and who were deemed operable candidates for surgical resection of the target tumor, were eligible. Additional requirements included at least 1 cm of tumor-free lung parenchyma between the target lesion and pleura or fissure, and willingness and ability to adhere to the protocol. Key exclusions included contraindications to surgery, prolonged chest infection, tumors abutting major central airways or vessels, tumors with pleural contact, tumors close to staple lines or metal objects, advanced emphysema, significant coagulopathy or inability to hold anticoagulation, pregnancy or breastfeeding, conflicting investigational study participation, presence of certain electronic implants, or intra-procedural findings that nullified eligibility.

Before the planned resection, subjects underwent CT-guided percutaneous microwave ablation of a single lung tumor using the Emprint™ Ablation System. A dedicated Emprint™ Procedure Planning Application was used as an adjunct to standard imaging. This software overlays a virtual predicted ablation zone on pre- or intra-procedure CT images based on lung-specific in vivo data relating power, time, and tissue type to ablation zone geometry. The physician used the application to prescribe an ablation dose (power and time) and to plan probe placement, including active and passive zones, to encompass the tumor with an intended margin while minimizing injury to normal lung.

A single ablation was performed for each tumor using one antenna. After the ablation, the patient remained intubated on single-lung ventilation. An immediate post-ablation CT scan was obtained with the antenna still in position, and this imaging was used to estimate the actual ablation zone, as defined by ground-glass opacity. These images were reviewed by at least two independent, blinded board-certified radiologists. The ablation zone was measured in three orthogonal dimensions (width X, height Y, depth Z) and volume was calculated. The predicted values generated by the Emprint™ software were then compared to the actual CT-based measurements to assess the primary endpoint, dose response.

The primary endpoint (dose response) was defined as the percentage change between predicted and observed ablation zone dimensions and volume, calculated as 100 × (A − P)/P, where A represents actual CT measurements and P represents software-predicted values. Percentage differences were summarized for ablation zone width, height, depth, and volume, as well as for ablation zone shape parameters. This analysis was performed for the modified intent-to-treat population (subjects who underwent the ablation procedure and had analyzable imaging).

After completion of imaging, patients proceeded to surgical resection (typically wedge resection) of the ablated lung tissue during the same operative session. Resected specimens were processed and evaluated at a single central pathology laboratory by blinded pathologists. Histologic assessment included standard Hematoxylin and Eosin staining and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen (NADH) viability staining. The key secondary endpoint, complete tumor ablation, was defined as 100% non-viable tumor cells on NADH staining. Secondary analyses categorized ablation status as complete ablation, incomplete ablation with positive margin, or incomplete ablation with delayed necrosis.

Safety endpoints included the type, incidence, severity, and relatedness of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) from induction of anesthesia through the first postoperative follow-up. Events such as bleeding, pneumothorax, hemothorax, air leak, and respiratory complications were captured and graded according to CTCAE criteria. The study specifically differentiated device-related from procedure-related and unrelated events.

Nineteen subjects consented; 15 underwent ablation and surgical resection and completed the study. Primary and secondary endpoint data were available for 11 subjects due to missing or unreadable post-ablation CT scans or unavailable tumor in resected specimens. The cohort included both primary lung cancers and pulmonary metastases (primarily colorectal and renal primaries). Analysis of the primary endpoint showed that the Emprint™ software consistently overestimated the ablation zone; actual volumes measured on immediate post-ablation CT were substantially smaller than predicted. The mean percentage difference for ablation zone volume indicated that observed zones were markedly reduced relative to predictions. The authors highlight that this discrepancy may be largely explained by tissue shrinkage during microwave ablation, which is known to be considerable in lung parenchyma, and by the very early timing of post-ablation imaging.

Histologically, complete ablation was confirmed in slightly more than half of evaluable tumors, with additional cases showing delayed necrosis or incomplete ablation. Some incomplete cases were attributed to technical issues such as suboptimal targeting or sampling errors when multiple lesions were resected. The study also notes that the requirement to limit ablations to a single activation and the need to preserve conditions favorable for surgery may have constrained the aggressiveness of ablation in some patients.

In terms of safety, no device-related adverse events were reported. Procedure-related AEs, including bleeding, pneumothorax, hemothorax, and minor respiratory events, were generally low grade and resolved without prolonged hospitalization. Several serious adverse events occurred but were determined to be not related or unlikely to be related to the ablation step. Overall, the study demonstrates that a percutaneous ablate-and-resect paradigm is feasible for lung tumors, provides insight into the performance of microwave ablation planning software, and underscores the importance of accounting for tissue shrinkage and optimal imaging timing when evaluating ablation zone prediction tools.",True,0.86,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
