GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,TP,TP,"This objective of this randomized controlled trial is to conduct a 2x2 test of a lifestyle intervention and metformin (a drug used to treat diabetes) to investigate how these treatments, alone or in combination, affect biomarkers associated with breast cancer survival. The Reach for Health Study will enroll 340 overweight/obese, postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. After completing the screening process and baseline measures, participants will be randomized in equal numbers to: (1) placebo, (2) metformin, (3) lifestyle intervention and placebo, or (4) lifestyle intervention and metformin. The intervention was powered on the main effects and the planned analyses are to compare: Metformin to Placebo and a separate comparison of Lifestyle intervention to control. The interventions will last for 6 months. Concentrations of circulating biomarkers will be assessed at baseline and 6 months.","This post-hoc analysis used data from a 6‑month randomized controlled trial with a 2×2 factorial design in overweight or obese postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. Participants were assigned to metformin, placebo, weight loss plus metformin, or weight loss plus placebo. The study evaluated whether metformin therapy and/or a behavioral weight loss intervention could slow biological aging, as measured by nine DNA methylation-based epigenetic age biomarkers in blood. Although these biomarkers correlated well with chronological age, no significant differences in epigenetic age measures were found between intervention arms over 6 months.",True,0.86,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,EV,EV,,"This study is a post-hoc analysis of a previously conducted randomized controlled trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01302379) that employed a 2×2 factorial design in overweight or obese postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. In the parent trial, 333 participants were randomized to one of four 6‑month interventions: daily metformin, placebo, a weight loss program with metformin, or a weight loss program with placebo. The weight loss intervention included a calorie goal and a moderate-intensity physical activity goal of 300 minutes per week delivered via a phone-based program.

For this epigenetic aging analysis, DNA methylation data were generated for 192 randomly selected participants using buffy coat DNA from fasting blood samples collected at baseline and at the 6‑month visit. DNA was processed with bisulfite conversion and profiled on the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. After quality control and probe filtering, 818,493 CpG probes remained for analysis. Beta values were normalized using functional normalization in the Bioconductor package ""minfi."" Nine epigenetic aging (EA) measures were computed: DNAmAge Hannum, DNAmAge Horvath, DNAm SkinBloodClock, DNAm PhenoAge, DNAm GrimAge, DNA methylation-based telomere length (DNAm TL), EpiTOC, EpiTOC2, and MiAge. EpiTOC/EpiTOC2 and MiAge were calculated using published R code, and the remaining clocks were computed via a public online calculator.

The primary objective was to examine whether 6 months of metformin therapy and/or weight loss would decelerate epigenetic aging, as reflected by age-adjusted epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) measures in leukocytes, compared with placebo. Unadjusted and adjusted linear mixed-effects models with a random intercept for participant were used to assess baseline-to-end-of-study changes in each EAA marker, comparing the three active intervention arms (weight loss only, metformin only, and weight loss plus metformin) versus placebo. Adjusted models included covariates for days from randomization to the final visit and DNA methylation-derived leukocyte composition. Sensitivity analyses restricted to participants with high adherence (≥5% weight loss and/or ≥80% pill adherence) were also conducted.

All epigenetic age measures showed significant correlations with chronological age, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.20 to 0.86. DNAm SkinBloodClock and DNAm GrimAge displayed the strongest positive correlations with age, while DNAm TL was negatively correlated, as expected for a telomere length proxy. Despite this, no intervention arm showed statistically significant differences or consistent trends in any epigenetic aging biomarker compared with placebo in either intent-to-treat or adherence-based analyses. A nominal association between high-adherence weight loss and accelerated epigenetic aging was observed for some measures (e.g., PhenoAge, DNAm TL), but these findings were opposite to the hypothesized direction and unlikely to remain significant after correction for multiple comparisons.

The investigators interpret the lack of significant effects as possibly reflecting insufficient intervention duration, tissue specificity of epigenetic clocks (leukocytes vs. other tissues such as liver), the relatively large measurement error of current clocks (often exceeding one year), and limited statistical power for detecting short-term changes. They also speculate that in older, overweight/obese cancer survivors, weight loss might worsen sarcopenia and muscle-fat imbalance, potentially contributing to increased biological aging in some contexts.

The study concludes that in this population of postmenopausal breast cancer survivors, six months of metformin and/or behavioral weight loss did not produce detectable changes in leukocyte epigenetic aging. The authors emphasize the need for longer-duration trials, better tissue targeting for epigenetic measurements, and consideration of body composition (muscle vs. fat) when designing interventions aimed at modifying biological aging as measured by DNA methylation-based clocks.",,,,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,True,False,True,False,False,False
