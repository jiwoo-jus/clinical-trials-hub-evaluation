GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"Background -Treatment Caesarean delivery is a commonly performed surgical procedure. Uterus contraction after delivery of the baby is necessary to avoid excessive bleeding.

Background - Therapeutic Information Adequate uterus contraction after delivery of the baby is necessary to avoid excessive bleeding. Prophylactic administration of an oxytocin receptor agonist is first line practice. Intravenous injection of oxytocin has been the standard procedure but serious cardiovascular adverse events have been reported. Lowering the dose or administering the drug as a 5 minute infusion may increase safety. Carbetocin, a synthetic oxytocin receptor agonist, has significantly longer half life and may reduce blood loss compared with oxytocin. The hemodynamic vasodilatory effects are comparable to oxytocin, but potential differences in adverse effects on myocardium are not well described yet.

Pre-Clinical \& Clinical Experience with Carbetocin (IMP) and Oxytocin Carbetocin has been in clinical use in EU for some years and the efficacy is documented in several RCTs. In the proposed study, carbetocin will be used within the conditions of the marketing authorization. Oxytocin is the first line treatment and prophylaxis in Norway and most countries in the world. According to recently published guidelines from EU drug authorities (EMA), oxytocin should be given as a slow, 5-minute infusion in order to avoid hypotension. This has so far not been implemented in Norway. The pre-clinical and clinical experience of the two drugs are summarized in the Summaries of Product Characteristics.

Rationale for the Study Pregnancy and delivery is a natural process, but for many women this period is stressful and not without risks of morbidity, and even mortality. Circulatory adverse events leading to death has been reported after intravenous injection of oxytocin. Some studies indicate that oxytocin may lead to dose dependent ischemic ECG changes, prolongation of QT time and liberation of biomarkers of myocardial cell death. Previously the investigators have demonstrated comparable vasodilatory effects of oxytocin and carbetocin. There is no clinical study comparing the specific myocardial effects of oxytocin with carbetocin. It may have great impact on the choice of standard medication if the cardiotoxicity of carbetocin is lower compared with oxytocin. The study of potential cardiotoxicity has to be performed in healthy women. Knowing that millions of laboring women have had uneventful injections of oxytocin and carbetocin after delivery, there is probably no reason to fear long lasting negative effects of either drug. If there are differences in cardiotoxicity, this new information should be taken into consideration when planning delivery in pregnant women with heart disease.

STUDY OBJECTIVES The aims of this study are to compare 0h (before C-section) plasma concentrations of Troponin I (high sensitive methods) with a second measurement of plasma concentration of Troponin I drawn within an interval of 6 to 10 hours after administration of study drug, in elective healthy C-section patients randomized to oxytocin 2.5 U or carbetocin 100 µg, 1 minute injection immediately after delivery.

Primary Endpoint Primary outcome measure is the difference in plasma concentration of Troponin I from baseline (0h) to the second measurement 6-10 hours after test drug administration, according to treatment allocation. Plasma concentrations will be collected before C-section, and at an interval of 6-10 h after test drug administration.

Secondary Endpoints

* Other myocardial biomarkers
* Uterus tone evaluated repeatedly
* Blood loss (estimated calculated blood loss)
* Postoperative pain and side effects.
* BP, heart rate and ECG changes","This is a multicentre, randomized, patient‑ and investigator‑blinded, parallel‑group Phase 4 clinical trial conducted at three obstetric units at Oslo University Hospital and Akershus University Hospital in Norway. It is a follow‑on confirmatory study to a 40‑patient pilot trial that indicated smaller increases in high‑sensitivity troponin I after carbetocin 100 µg compared with oxytocin 2.5 IU during elective caesarean delivery, with the largest difference seen at 10 hours post‑dose.

The trial enrols approximately 240 pregnant women, aged 18–50 years, with a normal singleton pregnancy at ≥36 weeks’ gestation, scheduled for planned caesarean delivery, and able to read and understand Norwegian. Women with common comorbidities such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and pregnancies after in vitro fertilization are eligible. Exclusion criteria include placenta praevia or invasive placenta, pre‑eclampsia, bleeding disorders (e.g. von Willebrand disease type I), treatment with low‑molecular‑weight heparin or other anticoagulants (except aspirin), known intolerance to the study drugs, prolonged QT interval or serious cardiac disease, liver or kidney failure, epilepsy, or other medical reasons deemed by the investigator. ECG is not systematically used as a screening tool.

Participants are randomized 1:1 via a computer‑generated sequence implemented in the electronic case report form system (Viedoc), using permuted blocks of varying sizes. Study drugs are prepared by unblinded staff otherwise not involved in the trial, diluted to 5 mL in normal saline, and labelled only with the trial identification and randomization number to ensure masking. The administering anaesthetist, the patient, and outcome assessors are blinded. Blinding adequacy is assessed for investigators.

At caesarean delivery under standardized spinal anaesthesia and haemodynamic management, women receive a single 1‑minute intravenous injection of either oxytocin 2.5 IU (Syntocinon®) or carbetocin 100 µg (Pabal®) immediately after delivery of the baby’s head and shoulders. These doses and injection times reflect routine practice at the centres and are consistent with guideline recommendations (oxytocin up to 3 IU or carbetocin up to 100 µg administered over more than 30 seconds). All caesarean sections use standardized surgical techniques including Pfannenstiel incision and uterus exteriorization according to local guidelines.

The prespecified primary endpoint is the between‑group difference in change from baseline in high‑sensitivity troponin I plasma concentration measured 6–10 hours after study drug administration. Blood is sampled before caesarean delivery and again between 6 and 10 hours after dosing. Plasma is stored at −70 °C and analysed in batch at the end of the study using a high‑sensitivity chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (Alinity i®, Abbott). The assay’s lower limit of detection is 0.1 ng/L; values below this are recorded as 0 ng/L. Existing literature suggests a female 99th percentile upper reference limit for high‑sensitivity troponin I of approximately 15 ng/L, but the study is designed to detect very small changes around these low baseline values in young, mostly healthy women.

Key secondary outcomes include:
- Uterine tone at 2.5 and 5 minutes after study drug administration, measured on a 0–10 numerical rating scale where 0 = no tonus, 10 = maximal tonus, 7 = clinically satisfactory tonus, and ≤6 correlates with need for rescue treatment. Obstetricians are instructed in use of this scale; prior work shows good inter‑rater reliability.
- Intraoperative blood loss estimated by suction and swab volume and calculated blood loss based on peri‑operative haematocrit, height, and weight.
- Need for uterotonic rescue therapy (timing, doses, and types of additional agents such as extra oxytocin, methylergometrine, prostaglandins, or surgical/mechanical interventions).
- Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) up to 48 hours post‑delivery, graded according to CTCAE v4.0. Expected AEs include flushing, feeling of warmth, chest pain, dyspnoea, palpitations, headache, nasal congestion, dry mouth, metallic taste, hypotension, and tachycardia.
- Vital signs (including invasive/non‑invasive blood pressure and heart rate) monitored during surgery; standard neonatal outcomes (Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes, umbilical cord acid–base status).
- Direct and indirect healthcare costs, including drug costs (oxytocin, carbetocin and rescue uterotonics), management of blood loss and side effects, transfusions, and staff time in theatre and in the post‑anaesthesia care unit.

A predefined sub‑study at one centre will assess postoperative pain in 80 women over the first 48 hours after delivery, recording pain scores (0–10 numerical rating scale) and opioid consumption in the context of standardized multimodal analgesia and patient‑controlled intravenous morphine. This aims to explore whether the choice of uterotonic agent influences postpartum pain experience.

Rescue uterotonic therapy for uterine atony consists of intravenous oxytocin 1 IU every 2 minutes up to a maximum of 5 IU, in addition to the allocated study drug. If uterine tone remains inadequate, further uterotonic treatment (e.g. oxytocin infusion, methylergometrine, prostaglandins, misoprostol) and/or surgical or mechanical measures are provided per departmental protocols. All concomitant medications, including anaesthetic agents, vasopressors (phenylephrine, ephedrine), fluids, and analgesics (paracetamol, NSAIDs, ketorolac, oxycodone), are recorded.

The sample size was derived from pilot data, where change from baseline troponin I at 10 hours was 0.41 ± 0.79 ng/L in the carbetocin group and 1.78 ± 4.48 ng/L in the oxytocin group. Assuming an absolute between‑group difference in mean change of 1.37 ng/L, 80% power, and a two‑sample t‑test with unequal variances at a 5% significance level, 178 patients (89 per group) are required. To allow for missing data and dropouts, 240 women will be enrolled. The primary analysis population is a modified intention‑to‑treat cohort including all randomized women who receive study drug. A per‑protocol definition and further sensitivity analyses are pre‑specified in a separate statistical analysis plan (SAP).

Continuous endpoints with baseline and follow‑up measurements are analysed using linear regression models with follow‑up value as the dependent variable and treatment group plus baseline value as covariates, estimating between‑group differences in change with 95% confidence intervals. Skewed distributions and non‑normal residuals will be addressed by using median regression with bootstrap‑based standard errors and confidence intervals. Single‑time‑point continuous variables will be compared with two‑sample t‑tests or median regression, as appropriate. Binary outcomes will be analysed using Fisher mid‑P tests with Newcombe hybrid score confidence intervals; ordered categorical variables (e.g. uterine tone scores) will be analysed with proportional odds (Wilcoxon‑Mann‑Whitney) methods.

The primary endpoint will also be examined in a prespecified sub‑population of women who receive their allocated study drug without requiring rescue treatment for uterine atony, to explore the effect of oxytocin versus carbetocin uncontaminated by additional oxytocin dosing. Troponin I results are analysed in batch only after the last participant has completed follow‑up, so perioperative patient care and rescue treatment decisions are not influenced by troponin data.

The trial adheres to ICH‑GCP and the Declaration of Helsinki, with approval from the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics, the Norwegian Medicines Agency, and institutional data protection authorities. All participants provide written informed consent. The study aims to clarify whether carbetocin and oxytocin differ in their potential to induce perioperative myocardial injury in women undergoing caesarean delivery, information that is particularly relevant for women with existing or future cardiovascular risk, and to balance any incremental myocardial risk against the benefits of preventing postpartum haemorrhage.",True,0.96,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
