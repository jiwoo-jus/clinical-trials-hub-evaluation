MenABCWY combines antigens from two licensed vaccines: 4CMenB (Bexsero), which protects against meningococcal serogroup B, and MenACWY-CRM (Menveo), which protects against serogroups A, C, W, and Y. Five groups were studied: MenABCWY alone (two doses); 4CMenB plus MenACWY given together in the same arm (two doses); 4CMenB plus MenACWY given in different arms (two doses); 4CMenB alone (two doses); and MenACWY alone (one dose). The main aim was to assess whether combining these antigens in MenABCWY or giving 4CMenB and MenACWY together causes immune interference, particularly for serogroup B responses, measured by human serum bactericidal assay (hSBA). The study found no substantial immunological interference between 4CMenB and MenACWY components for pooled serogroup B strains and showed that MenABCWY had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile.",True,0.82,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,EV,EV,,"This phase 2, randomized, open-label study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03587207) was conducted at 16 centers in the Czech Republic between July and December 2018 to investigate an investigational meningococcal ABCWY vaccine (MenABCWY) in healthy individuals aged 10 to 25 years. MenABCWY is a combined vaccine designed to provide protection against invasive meningococcal disease due to serogroups A, B, C, W, and Y by including antigens from two licensed vaccines: 4CMenB (Bexsero, GSK) and MenACWY-CRM (Menveo, GSK). The rationale is to simplify the vaccination schedule and potentially improve coverage by offering a single product covering five major serogroups.

A total of 500 participants were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 into five groups: (1) two doses of MenABCWY; (2) two doses of 4CMenB plus MenACWY administered concomitantly in the same arm (4CMenB+ACWY/S); (3) two doses of 4CMenB plus MenACWY administered concomitantly in different arms (4CMenB+ACWY/D); (4) two doses of 4CMenB alone; and (5) a single dose of MenACWY alone. Doses in the two-dose regimens were given 2 months apart (days 1 and 61), with blood sampling before vaccination and 1 month after each dose (days 1, 31, and 91 for two-dose groups; days 1 and 31 for the MenACWY-only group). Participants were stratified by age (10–17 years and 18–25 years). Key exclusion criteria included prior meningococcal vaccination, history of meningococcal disease, contact with meningococcal disease within 60 days, significant immune or blood disorders, immune-mediated disease, recent immunoglobulin or blood product receipt, recent investigational product use, significant neurological disorders or seizures, and pregnancy or breastfeeding.

MenABCWY was prepared by reconstituting a lyophilized CRM197-conjugated oligosaccharide component (serogroups A, C, W, Y) with a liquid suspension containing recombinant serogroup B proteins (NadA, fHbp, NHBA) and outer membrane vesicle (OMV) components from serogroup B strain NZ98/254. Each 0.5 mL MenABCWY dose contained 10 μg MenA-CRM197, 5 μg each of MenC-, MenW-, and MenY-CRM197, 50 μg of each MenB recombinant protein, 25 μg OMV, and 1.5 mg aluminum hydroxide. MenACWY-CRM contained 10 μg MenA-CRM197 and 5 μg each of MenC-, MenW-, and MenY-CRM197 in a two-component lyophilized/liquid formulation. 4CMenB contained 50 μg of each MenB recombinant protein, 25 μg OMV, and 1.5 mg aluminum hydroxide. Vaccines were administered intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle; in the 4CMenB+ACWY/S group, both injections were in different sites of the same (nondominant) arm; in the 4CMenB+ACWY/D group, 4CMenB was injected in the nondominant arm and MenACWY in the dominant arm.

The primary objective was to assess immune responses one month after the last scheduled vaccination, focusing on potential immune interference among vaccine antigens. Immunogenicity was evaluated by human serum bactericidal assay (hSBA) against pooled serogroup B test strains representing the main 4CMenB/MenABCWY antigens (fHbp, NadA, PorA, NHBA) and against serogroups A, C, W, and Y. For serogroup B, the panel included strain M14459 (fHbp v1.1), 96217 (NadA), NZ98/254 (PorA P1.4), and M07-0241084 (NHBA). Outcomes included hSBA geometric mean titers (GMTs), the proportion of subjects with hSBA titers at or above the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), and the proportion achieving at least a 4-fold increase from baseline. GMT ratios (postvaccination to baseline) were also calculated. The study was powered to detect potential global immune interference in pooled serogroup B responses when vaccines were given concomitantly in the same arm versus different arms, assuming a possible lymph node ""stress"" effect. An ANCOVA model was used for pooled serogroup B GMTs, with study group, center, and strain as fixed effects and log-transformed baseline titer as a covariate. The 4CMenB+ACWY/S group was considered statistically inferior to 4CMenB+ACWY/D if the two-sided 80% confidence interval for the GMT ratio was entirely below 1. Differences between MenABCWY and 4CMenB+ACWY/S were examined descriptively; the study was not powered for detailed per-strain comparisons.

One month after the second dose, hSBA GMTs against pooled serogroup B strains were similar in the 4CMenB+ACWY/S and 4CMenB+ACWY/D groups, with a GMT ratio of 0.96 (80% CI, 0.83–1.10), indicating no evidence of substantial immunological interference due to same-arm administration. The MenABCWY group had somewhat lower pooled serogroup B GMTs (31.84; 80% CI, 28.18–35.98) than the 4CMenB+ACWY/S (38.48; 80% CI, 34.23–43.26) and 4CMenB+ACWY/D (40.08; 80% CI, 35.44–45.33) groups, and lower than the 4CMenB group (42.38; 80% CI, 37.31–48.13), with a MenABCWY vs 4CMenB+ACWY/S GMT ratio of 0.83 (80% CI, 0.72–0.95). For individual serogroup B strains, responses were similar between the two 4CMenB+ACWY groups, but MenABCWY elicited lower responses to NadA, PorA, and NHBA compared with 4CMenB, and lower responses to PorA and NHBA compared with 4CMenB+ACWY/D. These differences were descriptive and the causes were not defined.

For serogroups A, C, W, and Y, GMTs after two doses of MenABCWY were generally similar to those after two doses of 4CMenB+MenACWY, except for serogroup A, where MenABCWY GMTs (104.90; 80% CI, 87.02–126.47) were lower than those in the 4CMenB+ACWY/S (187.52; 80% CI, 156.94–224.05) and 4CMenB+ACWY/D (204.01; 80% CI, 169.06–246.18) groups. A single dose of MenACWY elicited lower serogroup A, C, W, and Y responses than two doses of MenABCWY or 4CMenB+MenACWY. Across groups, proportions of subjects achieving titers ≥LLOQ and ≥4-fold increases for most serogroups and strains were similar, with some lower proportions in the MenABCWY group for specific antigens (notably serogroup A, PorA, and NHBA).

Safety and reactogenicity were secondary endpoints. Participants were observed for 30 minutes after each vaccination and recorded solicited local (injection-site erythema, swelling, induration, pain) and systemic (arthralgia, fatigue, nausea, headache, myalgia, fever) adverse events (AEs) for 7 days post-dose using diary cards. Unsolicited AEs were recorded for 30 days after each dose. Medically attended AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), AEs leading to withdrawal, and arthritis (as an adverse event of special interest) were monitored throughout the study.

Solicited local AEs were common and largely consistent across groups receiving two-dose schedules. After the first dose, 90.0–97.1% of participants in the MenABCWY, 4CMenB+ACWY/S, 4CMenB+ACWY/D, and 4CMenB groups reported at least one local AE, compared with 57.8% in the MenACWY-only group. Pain at the injection site was the most frequent local AE (approximately 89.0–96.2% after first doses and 87.0–95.0% after second doses in multi-component groups; 51.0% with single-dose MenACWY). Severe pain (preventing normal activity) occurred in 12.8–21.2% of participants after each dose in the multi-component groups and in 2.9% of MenACWY-only recipients.

Solicited systemic AEs were reported by 64.9–70.2% of participants after first doses and 62.5–71.0% after second doses in the MenABCWY and 4CMenB±ACWY groups, and by 58.8% in the MenACWY-only group. The most frequent systemic AEs were fatigue (approximately 50–60% after first dose and 58–62% after second dose in multi-component groups, 50% in MenACWY-only) and headache (approximately 35–53% across groups). Most systemic AEs were mild or moderate; severe fatigue and severe headache were infrequent. Fever ≥38°C occurred in 1.1–6.0% of participants per group per dose; no fevers ≥40°C were reported.

Unsolicited AEs within 30 days post-vaccination were reported in 23.0–26.0% of participants in the multi-component groups and in 14.7% of MenACWY-only recipients. Common unsolicited AEs included injection-site pain, injection-site induration, and upper respiratory tract infections. Medically attended unsolicited AEs occurred in 5.9–16.3% of participants across groups, with conditions such as upper respiratory tract infection, tonsillitis, viral infection, pharyngitis, ligament sprain, concussion, toothache, and syncope occurring in small numbers. Five SAEs were reported: two concussions (4CMenB+ACWY/S), two bone fractures (one in 4CMenB+ACWY/D, one in 4CMenB), and one syncope (4CMenB). Only the syncope, occurring one day after the last 4CMenB dose, was considered possibly or probably related to vaccination; the subject fully recovered. No cases of arthritis were reported, no participants withdrew because of AEs, and no deaths occurred.

Overall, the study concluded that administering two doses of MenABCWY to healthy 10- to 25-year-olds does not appear to be associated with substantial immunological interference for pooled serogroup B test strains, and that concomitant administration of 4CMenB and MenACWY in the same or different arms does not materially alter serogroup B immune responses. MenABCWY showed an acceptable reactogenicity and safety profile, comparable to licensed comparators, supporting further clinical development of this combined meningococcal ABCWY vaccine.",,,,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,True,False,True,False,False,False
