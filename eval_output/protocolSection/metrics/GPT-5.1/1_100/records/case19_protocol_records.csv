A previous study documented that Bl-04 has significant effects on the innate immune response in the nose and this study will be powered to assess whether these effects translate into a demonstrable clinical benefit. Volunteers will be given Bl-04 or placebo for 28 days then challenged with rhinovirus. The primary analysis will be on the proportion of volunteers who develop a rhinovirus associated illness in the two treatment groups.","This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human rhinovirus challenge trial evaluated whether oral supplementation with the probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04 can prevent or reduce rhinovirus-induced common colds in healthy adults. Volunteers ingested Bl-04 or placebo daily for 28 days and were then experimentally infected intranasally with rhinovirus type A39 and followed for 14 days to assess infection, cold symptoms, and immune responses. The primary objective was to determine if Bl-04 lowers the incidence of rhinovirus-associated illness; secondary and exploratory objectives included evaluating viral shedding, symptom severity and duration, nasal cytokine responses, blood transcriptomic changes, and nasal, throat, and fecal microbiota profiles.

GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,EV,EV,,"This study investigated the effects of the probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04 on experimentally induced rhinovirus infection and illness in healthy adults using a well-established human rhinovirus (RV) challenge model. The rationale was based on prior, inconsistent evidence suggesting that certain probiotics may modulate host immunity and reduce the incidence or severity of viral upper respiratory tract infections, including the common cold, but with limited mechanistic data and variable study quality.

Healthy volunteers aged 18–60 years, primarily from a university community, were screened for susceptibility to rhinovirus type A39, defined as a serum neutralizing antibody titer ≤1:4. Eligible participants without significant underlying respiratory or gastrointestinal disease and without acute illness were randomized 1:1, using a computer-generated block randomization scheme, to receive either Bl-04 or placebo. The active product consisted of a daily sachet containing at least 2 × 10^9 colony-forming units of Bl-04 mixed with 1 g of sucrose; the placebo sachet contained 1 g of sucrose alone. Supplements were indistinguishable in appearance, smell, and taste. Study staff and participants were blinded to allocation.

Supplementation began 28 days prior to viral challenge (day −28) and continued through 14 days after challenge (day 14). Participants attended several visits between day −28 and day 0 for compliance checks and resupply of study product and were instructed to avoid other probiotics, probiotic-containing foods, antibiotics, and anti-inflammatory medications during the supplementation period. Compliance was monitored by counting returned sachets and confirmed in the active group by detecting Bl-04 in stool using strain-specific qPCR.

On day 0, after 28 days of supplementation, all participants were inoculated intranasally with 20–100 TCID50 of rhinovirus A39 using drops prepared under GMP conditions and tested under an FDA IND. Nasal lavage samples collected on day 0 were screened for other respiratory viruses by multiplex PCR to exclude concurrent infections. Post-challenge nasal lavage specimens were collected on days 1–5 for RV culture and quantification of viral titers. Serum collected before and after challenge was tested for neutralizing antibody; infection was defined by either virus isolation from post-challenge nasal lavages or a ≥4-fold rise in RV-A39 neutralizing antibody titer.

Clinical symptoms typical of the common cold (nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, sneezing, headache, myalgia, chilliness) were assessed using a modified Jackson score. Symptoms were scored daily by staff interview on days 1–5 and self-recorded in diaries on days 6–14, using a 0–4 scale (absent to very severe). Total symptom scores over the first 5 days and over days 1–14 were calculated. A protocol-defined rhinovirus-associated illness required both virologically confirmed infection and a clinical illness meeting prespecified criteria: a total symptom score of at least 6 plus either at least three days of rhinorrhea or the participant’s subjective impression of having had a cold.

The primary outcome was the incidence of rhinovirus-associated illness in the per-protocol population, which included participants who were susceptible at baseline, had no other virus detected at day 0, were infected with RV-A39, completed follow-up, and took at least 80% of the assigned doses. Secondary endpoints included incidence of RV infection, presence and magnitude of viral shedding in nasal secretions, duration of illness among those who became ill, and total symptom scores over days 1–5 and 1–14. The incidence of RV-associated illness was compared between groups using chi-square tests; symptom scores were analyzed using Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations; duration of illness was compared with Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests; and viral titers were analyzed with repeated-measures ANOVA. A hierarchical testing strategy was used to control type I error among secondary endpoints.

To explore potential mechanisms of action, several immunologic and microbiome measures were evaluated. Nasal lavage samples collected longitudinally (day −28, 0, and post-challenge) were analyzed for cytokines and chemokines, including IL-8/CXCL8, IL-1β, IL-6, G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, IFN-γ, and IL-10 using ELISA and multiplex platforms. Changes in these mediators from pre-supplementation to pre-challenge and from post-challenge time points were compared between treatment arms with repeated-measures ANCOVA.

Peripheral blood samples collected in PAXgene tubes on days −28, 0, and 2 post-challenge were analyzed by targeted transcriptomics using a panel of inflammatory and antiviral genes. Differential gene expression was assessed between active and placebo groups, between infected and uninfected participants, and between those who developed rhinovirus-associated illness and those who did not. Pathway analyses examined functional categories such as immune responses, cell signaling, and inflammatory pathways.

Microbiota composition of the nose, throat, and gut was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing (V4 region; QIIME2). Nasal swabs were collected on days −28, 0, and 3; throat swabs on days −28, 0, 3, 5, and 14; and a fecal sample on day 0. Alpha diversity and beta diversity were compared between treatment arms and across time. Differential abundance analyses examined whether probiotic supplementation affected specific bacterial taxa. The potential influence of baseline (day −28 or day 0) abundance of key nasal genera (e.g., Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Moraxella, Alloiococcus) and dominant fecal genera (e.g., Blautia, Faecalibacterium, Coprococcus) on clinical endpoints such as total symptom scores and illness duration was evaluated using regression models, including interaction terms with treatment where relevant. Strain-specific PCR methods were used to detect Bl-04 in stool and upper airway samples. Throat swabs were also screened by qPCR for DNA of potentially pathogenic bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes group A).

Safety was assessed in all participants who received study product (165 active, 169 placebo). Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) were collected at each visit and coded using MedDRA. Investigators judged the relatedness of AEs to study interventions (supplementation, procedures, viral challenge) while blinded to treatment allocation.

A total of 334 participants were randomized; 318 completed the study. The per-protocol population comprised 232 participants (112 active, 120 placebo). The incidence of protocol-defined rhinovirus-associated illness did not differ significantly between groups: 56% (95% CI, 47–66%) in the active group versus 50% (95% CI, 41–59%) in the placebo group (χ² = 0.91, p = 0.34). The difference in illness rates (active minus placebo) was 6.3% (95% CI, −6.7 to 19.1). RV infection, confirmed by culture or serology, occurred in 86% of active and 80% of placebo participants (p = 0.25), and proportions of participants with detectable virus in nasal secretions or with seroconversion were also similar. Quantitative viral titers in nasal lavage over days 1–5 post-challenge were comparable between groups.

Symptom burden and illness duration were not improved by Bl-04. Mean daily total symptom scores over days 1–5 and 1–14, analyzed via Poisson regression, showed no significant differences between active and placebo. Among those who developed rhinovirus-associated illness, the median duration of illness was 11.0 days in the active group and 11.5 days in the placebo group, with no significant difference.

Exploratory analyses of nasal cytokines showed that IL-1β levels increased modestly more from day −28 to day 0 in the active group compared with placebo, suggesting a small pre-challenge proinflammatory effect; however, no consistent or clinically meaningful probiotic-induced differences were found in nasal cytokine responses to rhinovirus infection across the measured mediators. Blood transcriptomic analyses revealed strong transcriptional responses to infection (hundreds of genes up- or down-regulated on day 2 in infected vs. non-infected participants), predominantly in immune and inflammatory pathways, but no genes were differentially expressed between Bl-04 and placebo groups at any time point.

Microbiome analysis indicated that oral Bl-04 supplementation had minimal impact on nasal and fecal microbiota composition or diversity. In the throat, alpha diversity modestly decreased in the probiotic group and increased in the placebo group between day −28 and day 0, but overall taxonomic profiles (e.g., Streptococcus, Prevotella, Veillonella, Actinomyces) remained similar. The nasal microbiota, dominated by genera such as Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Alloiococcus, Haemophilus, Streptococcus, Peptoniphilus, and Moraxella, showed no major shifts attributable to Bl-04 or to the rhinovirus infection itself. Certain baseline microbiota features—such as higher fecal Blautia abundance associating with lower total symptom scores and higher Faecalibacterium abundance associating with longer illness duration—suggest that host microbiome composition may influence individual responses to viral challenge, but these associations were independent of probiotic supplementation.

Safety analyses indicated that Bl-04 was well tolerated. A small number of AEs judged definitely or probably related to study interventions occurred in both arms (2% in active vs. 4% in placebo), primarily attributable to study procedures or the viral infection itself. No AEs were judged definitely or probably related to ingestion of the probiotic.

Overall, this large, rigorously conducted rhinovirus challenge study found no effectiveness of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04 in preventing or mitigating RV-A39 infection or rhinovirus-associated illness in healthy adults. The probiotic did not produce meaningful changes in systemic or mucosal immune markers or in the nasopharyngeal and fecal microbiota that would explain a protective mechanism. Together with previous data, these findings suggest that orally administered Bl-04 is unlikely to provide clinically important benefit in the prevention or treatment of rhinovirus-induced common colds, and they highlight the need for further research into the mechanisms and strain-specific effects of probiotics in respiratory viral infections.",,,,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,True,False,True,False,False,False
