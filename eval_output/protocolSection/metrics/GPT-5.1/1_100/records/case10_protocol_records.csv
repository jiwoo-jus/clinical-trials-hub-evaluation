A total of 307 children with CPP, predominantly girls, received subcutaneous leuprorelin 1.88 or 3.75 mg every 4 weeks for 96 weeks. The main goal was to assess how often treatment-emergent adverse events occurred and whether pubertal development, measured by Tanner stage, stopped progressing or regressed. The study also examined hormone suppression, changes in bone age relative to chronological age, predicted adult height, body mass index, and bone mineral density. The results showed that leuprorelin was generally well tolerated, with mostly mild or moderate adverse events, and effectively suppressed the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, slowed pubertal progression, improved predicted adult height, and reduced the bone age/chronological age ratio in most patients.",True,0.93,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"The drug in this study is called leuprorelin. It is administered as a 1 month subcutaneous depot injection. Leuprorelin is used to treat children who have CPP. This study will look at whether leuprorelin can stop early puberty in pre-pubertal children.

The study will enroll approximately 300 participants. Participants with body weight \>=20 kg will receive the recommended dose of leuprorelin 3.75 mg subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks for 96 weeks. Participants with body weight \<20 kg will receive recommended dose of 1.88 mg subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks for 96 weeks.

This trial will be conducted in China. The overall time to participate in this study is 104 weeks. Participants will make 11 visits to the clinic, and will be followed-up by the physician on a long-term basis until stable puberty is reached.","This was a large, prospective, open-label, multicenter clinical trial conducted at 11 pediatric centers in China to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of leuprorelin in children with central precocious puberty (CPP). CPP was defined as the premature onset of secondary sexual characteristics due to early activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Eligible patients were girls younger than 8 years and boys younger than 9 years with confirmed CPP based on clinical signs, hormonal criteria (elevated basal or GnRH-stimulated luteinizing hormone [LH] with LH/follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] ratio >0.6), ultrasonographic evidence of gonadal development, advanced bone age (BA) by at least 1 year, and compromised predicted adult height.

The study included a 4-week screening period, 96 weeks of leuprorelin treatment, and a 4-week safety follow-up. Children with body mass ≥20 kg received 3.75 mg leuprorelin subcutaneously every 4 weeks; those <20 kg received 1.88 mg every 4 weeks. Doses could be adjusted based on clinical response and investigator judgment. Treatment evaluations occurred approximately every 12 weeks and included Tanner stage assessment, anthropometric measurements (height, body mass, body mass index), bone mineral density (BMD), BA assessment, and pelvic ultrasonography. Hormonal assessments included GnRH-stimulated peak LH and FSH, and basal estradiol (E2) in girls and testosterone in boys.

The primary endpoint was the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). The main secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients with regression or no progression in Tanner stage at week 96 compared with baseline. Additional endpoints included: suppression of peak LH and FSH to prepubertal levels in stimulation testing; suppression of basal sex steroid concentrations (E2 in females, testosterone in males) to prepubertal levels; improvement in predicted adult height using the Bayley–Pinneau method; reduction in the BA/chronological age (CA) ratio using Tanner–Whitehouse 3 standards; and changes in BMI and BMD over the treatment period.

A total of 340 children were screened and 307 were enrolled and treated (305 girls and 2 boys). Most patients received leuprorelin for more than 672 days (approximately 96 weeks), and 98% had greater than 90% treatment compliance. The majority (over 96%) started at a dose ≥90 μg/kg, and most remained on higher doses throughout treatment.

Safety findings showed that 252 patients (82.1%) experienced at least one TEAE, but 71.3% of patients had TEAEs judged unrelated to the study drug. Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. Common TEAEs (≥5%) were mainly infections and respiratory-related events (upper respiratory tract infection, cough, pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis). Drug-related TEAEs occurred in 10.7% of patients; the most frequent were injection site induration (4.6%) and vaginal bleeding (2.3%). Injection site reactions were self-limited. Vaginal bleeding typically occurred once within the first 1–2 months of treatment, consistent with estrogen withdrawal due to gonadotropin suppression. Twenty-one serious AEs occurred in 12 patients, none deemed related to leuprorelin; one patient withdrew due to a tibial fibula fracture. No deaths were reported. No relevant trends were observed in laboratory tests, vital signs, or electrocardiograms.

Efficacy analyses focused on the 305 female patients because only 2 males were enrolled. At week 96, 83.5% of evaluable girls (238/285) had regression or no progression of Tanner stage compared with baseline, while 16.5% showed progression. Suppression of GnRH-stimulated peak LH to prepubertal levels (≤2 U/L) occurred in 90.4% (253/280) of patients, and suppression of peak FSH (≤6.7 U/L) in 95.4% (270/283). Basal E2 was reduced to prepubertal levels (≤20 pg/mL) in 59.4% (168/283) of girls.

With respect to growth and maturation, 64.6% of girls (181/280) had an improved predicted adult height at week 96 compared with baseline, with a mean increase of 2.19 cm. The BA/CA ratio decreased in 94% of patients (252/268), with a mean change of −0.11, indicating slowing of skeletal maturation. BMI increased by a mean of 1.66 kg/m² over 96 weeks, consistent with some reports of transient BMI increases during GnRH analog therapy. BMD changed minimally over the treatment period (mean change ~0.041 g/cm² around week 100), suggesting that bone mineral accrual was not adversely impacted in a clinically meaningful way during the treatment period.

The study confirmed that monthly subcutaneous leuprorelin at 1.88–3.75 mg (approximately 30–180 μg/kg) is effective in suppressing the HPG axis and halting or reversing pubertal progression in most Chinese children with CPP, while improving growth prognosis as reflected by predicted adult height and a reduced BA/CA ratio. The safety profile, including the nature and frequency of drug-related adverse events such as injection site reactions and transient vaginal bleeding, was consistent with the known profile of GnRH analog therapy. The trial provides long-term safety and efficacy data supporting the use of leuprorelin at the higher dose range approved in China for CPP treatment, although the small number of male participants and the concentration of centers in more developed regions were noted limitations.",True,0.86,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
