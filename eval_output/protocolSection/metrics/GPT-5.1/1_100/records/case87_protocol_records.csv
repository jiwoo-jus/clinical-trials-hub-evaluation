Subjects will take part in a 16 week training intervention that can consist of aerobic, resistance, aerobic \& resistance, or a control group. Pre and Post testing will include stress tests, echos, blood, and urine samples.","This randomized controlled trial evaluated three supervised exercise regimens compared with an attention control condition in post‑treatment lung cancer survivors with poor cardiorespiratory fitness. Participants, 1–10 years after completion of definitive lung cancer therapy and below age‑ and sex‑matched sedentary VO2peak values, were randomized to aerobic training (AT), resistance training (RT), combination training (CT = AT + RT), or stretching attention control for 16 weeks (48 sessions). The main question was which exercise modality most effectively improves cardiorespiratory fitness (measured as VO2peak). Secondary objectives included effects on muscle strength, body composition, patient‑reported outcomes, and the tolerability and safety of each regimen. AT and CT produced modest but statistically significant improvements in VO2peak versus control, while RT did not. RT‑containing regimens improved strength and body composition but were less well tolerated. Overall, AT showed the most favorable balance between benefit and tolerability for improving cardiorespiratory fitness in this population.",True,0.93,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,EV,EV,,"This parallel‑group, factorial randomized controlled trial investigated the effects and tolerability of different exercise therapy modalities on cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in post‑treatment lung cancer survivors with objectively documented poor fitness. Eligible patients were 21–80 years old, 1 to <10 years after completion of all definitive lung cancer therapy (surgery with or without adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation), had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤1, life expectancy ≥4 months, and VO2peak values below age–sex matched sedentary reference levels. Participants were performing less than 150 minutes per week of structured moderate‑intensity exercise at baseline.

Ninety patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of four groups for 16 weeks (48 supervised sessions, three times weekly): (1) Aerobic training (AT), consisting of individualized stationary cycle ergometry prescribed at 55% to >95% of peak oxygen consumption, with both continuous and interval formats and non‑linear periodized progression; (2) Resistance training (RT), consisting of 14 upper and lower extremity exercises, progressed over time to three sets of 6–18 repetitions at 50–85% of one‑repetition maximum, with individualized loading based on baseline and mid‑intervention strength testing; (3) Combination training (CT), incorporating both AT and RT within the same sessions following the individual AT and RT dosing schedules, with 30–90 minutes per session; and (4) Attention control (AC), consisting of supervised stretching sessions (12–20 positions held for 20–45 seconds) designed to control for social interaction and attention without providing a structured training stimulus.

The primary endpoint was change in CRF, quantified as VO2peak (mL O2·kg−1·min−1) measured by symptom‑limited cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) on a cycle ergometer with breath‑by‑breath gas analysis and 12‑lead ECG monitoring. To reduce learning effects, two baseline CPETs were performed, and the higher acceptable value was used. Secondary endpoints included other CPET parameters (e.g., ventilation, peak heart rate), maximal muscular strength (one‑repetition maximum for chest press, seated row, and leg press), body composition (lean mass and fat mass by DXA or air‑displacement plethysmography), and multiple patient‑reported outcomes (PROs), including quality of life [FACT‑L, FACT‑G], fatigue [FACIT‑Fatigue], pain [Brief Pain Inventory], and sleep quality [Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index]. Tolerability was assessed with a multidimensional framework adapted from drug trials, including relative dose intensity (RDI; ratio of completed to planned cumulative exercise dose), lost to follow‑up, session attendance, permanent discontinuation, treatment interruptions (≥3 consecutive missed sessions), dose modifications (changes in intensity or duration in ≥10% of sessions), pretreatment dose reductions, and early session terminations. Safety was evaluated by recording serious and non‑serious adverse events during CPET and all training sessions.

The study was powered originally for 160 participants but closed early at 90 due to slow accrual, rendering the results exploratory and hypothesis‑generating. In intention‑to‑treat analyses with adjustment for baseline values, age, body mass index, and comorbidities (coronary artery disease, COPD, hypertension), AT and CT produced statistically significant improvements in VO2peak versus attention control: AT increased VO2peak by 1.1 mL O2·kg−1·min−1 (95% CI 0.0 to 2.2; P = 0.04) and CT by 1.4 mL O2·kg−1·min−1 (95% CI 0.2 to 2.5; P = 0.02). RT did not differ from AC in VO2peak change (−0.1 mL O2·kg−1·min−1, 95% CI −1.2 to 1.0; P = 0.88). About half of participants in AT and CT achieved VO2peak gains greater than the technical error threshold (≥1.12 mL O2·kg−1·min−1), compared with 13% in RT and AC.

For secondary outcomes, AT improved several other cardiopulmonary responses (e.g., ventilation, peak heart rate) compared with attention control. RT, and to a similar extent CT, produced significant gains in upper and lower extremity maximal strength and favorable trends in body composition (increased lean mass and decreased fat mass) compared with AC. However, none of the exercise regimens significantly improved PROs relative to stretching attention control, suggesting that social interaction and structured contact may account for much of the PRO benefit seen in prior exercise trials that used usual‑care controls.

Tolerability differed by modality. Relative dose intensity was significantly lower in RT and CT compared with AT (RT −24%, CT −30% versus AT), indicating more frequent modifications, interruptions, or incomplete sessions in RT‑containing regimens. While lost‑to‑follow‑up and average attendance were acceptable and similar across arms, permanent discontinuations and treatment interruptions were more common in RT and CT. Arthralgia was the most frequent reason for dose modification and occurred far more often in RT‑containing regimens (65% in RT and 60% in CT) than in AT and AC (13% each). No serious adverse events occurred during CPET or training sessions, indicating that all regimens were safe under close supervision.

The investigators concluded that, among lung cancer survivors with markedly reduced CRF, both aerobic training alone and combination training can produce modest but significant improvements in VO2peak compared with a stretching attention control. Single‑modality resistance training does not enhance CRF but does improve strength and body composition and may be appropriate for patients in whom muscle mass or strength is the primary clinical concern (e.g., those at risk for cancer‑related cachexia or sarcopenia). Considering efficacy, time commitment, and tolerability metrics such as relative dose intensity and adverse events, the authors suggest that aerobic training offers the most favorable benefit‑to‑tolerability ratio for targeting impaired cardiorespiratory fitness in this post‑treatment lung cancer population. The findings also highlight substantial inter‑individual variability in CRF response and support future work on more personalized exercise prescriptions and on remote or telemedicine‑based delivery models to improve feasibility and accrual in similar trials.",,,,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,True,False,True,False,False,False
