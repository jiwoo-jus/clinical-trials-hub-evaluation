Theoretically-guided by the Health Information Technology Usability Evaluation Model (Health-ITUEM), the proposed project will refine and test a next-generation diagnostic intervention delivered on a mobile platform to improve HIV testing and linkage-to-care outcomes among youth living with and at-risk for HIV. Given the pervasiveness, low cost, and convenience of mobile technology, the investigators hope that the App can help achieve the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy in the US by increasing the number of persons living with HIV who know their serostatus, decreasing HIV-related disparities, and ultimately reducing the risk of HIV transmission and acquisition.","This three-arm randomized controlled trial evaluates the mLab App, a mobile health intervention designed to increase HIV testing and linkage to care among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and young transgender women (YTGW) aged 18–29 years in New York City and Chicago. The app combines HIV prevention information, automated reminders, and a mobile phone imaging feature that interprets the results of at-home OraQuick HIV self-tests and provides real-time feedback and guidance. Participants are randomized to: (1) mLab App plus HIV home test kits and standard preventive care, (2) standard preventive care only, or (3) HIV home test kits plus standard preventive care. The main hypothesis is that access to the mLab App will increase the proportion of youth who test for HIV and improve linkage to confirmatory testing and care among those with reactive results.",True,0.86,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"The number of youth living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to rise, and they are disproportionately represented at each stage of the care continuum. Most relevant to this study, it is estimated that less than half of HIV-infected youth in the United States (US) have been diagnosed with HIV, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related deaths among youth have increased over the past decade despite decreased death rates among all other age groups, pointing to the urgent need for increased testing among youth.

Black and Latino youth are at increased risk of poor HIV-related outcomes and have disparate testing rates as compared to White youth. Mobile Health (mHealth) technology is a powerful and relevant tool which represents a promising approach for improving outcomes among youth living with HIV. Youth are avid adopters and heavy users of smartphones and digital technologies, and these technologies offer opportunities to tailor interventions to developmental stages and personal needs. Importantly, these technologies are capable of delivering interventions in real-time and in ecologic settings. This creates an opportunity to remotely reach youth through mobile and connected health approaches to strengthen their HIV care continuum engagement and treatment outcomes. In response, the investigators have developed the mLab App, an innovative mobile and connected technology that combines HIV prevention information with push notifications/reminders to complete HIV testing and an automated image processing feature to provide accessible, objective, secure, and real-time feedback on home-based OraQuick (lateral flow assay) HIV test results. The mLab App also contains an innovative automated data collection and a results reporting feature. Findings from the investigators' preliminary work in New York City indicate that youth perceive the mLab App as useful, easy to use, and effective at improving health outcomes and intend to use the technology. Furthermore, preliminary work in Africa support the sensitivity and specificity of the imaging algorithm for interpreting lateral flow assay results.

The investigators will conduct a careful, iterative process of technology refinement based on input from end users, experts, and the youth advisory board. The investigators will then enroll 525 high-risk youth (age 18-29 years) in a 12-month randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess differences in HIV testing rates and linkage to care between three arms the intervention arm, the standard of care-HIV information control arm, and the HIV home test arm. Finally, the investigators will analyze paradata, defined as auxiliary data that capture details about the process of interaction with the technology, to understand the effect of user engagement of the mLab App on improving HIV testing rates and linkage to care. Interventions delivered through mHealth technology represent a promising approach for improving outcomes among youth.","This study tests the effectiveness of the mLab App, a mobile phone-based, FDA-regulated investigational device, in improving HIV testing behaviors and linkage to care among Black, Latino, and other young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and young transgender women (YTGW) aged 18–29 years living in and around New York City and Chicago. These populations bear a disproportionate burden of HIV in the United States and face substantial social (e.g., stigma, homophobia, transphobia, racism) and healthcare system barriers (e.g., limited youth-centered HIV services) to HIV testing and care.

The mLab App integrates HIV prevention education, email/text reminders, and an automated image-processing algorithm that analyzes photographs of completed OraQuick rapid home HIV self-tests. Users log in with assigned credentials, receive personalized greetings, see their intervention progress, access daily HIV prevention facts, and receive automated reminders to test every 3 months. After performing an OraQuick self-test, participants visually interpret their test following manufacturer instructions, then upload a photo to the app. The app’s algorithm provides an experimental, real-time interpretation of the test image and sends both the user and research team the interpreted result to support ongoing monitoring, repeat testing for non-reactive tests, and rapid linkage to confirmatory testing and treatment for reactive tests. The app’s automated data collection feature captures user-submitted test results and images for further analysis.

The trial uses a three-arm randomized controlled design with 525 participants allocated in a 2:2:1 ratio, stratified by site (Chicago, NYC): Arm 1 receives the mLab App, two OraQuick home HIV tests at baseline plus two more at 6 months, and standard HIV preventive care; Arm 2 receives standard preventive care only; Arm 3 receives two OraQuick home HIV tests at baseline plus two more at 6 months and standard preventive care, but not the app. Standard preventive care for all arms at baseline includes in-person HIV testing, HIV prevention and testing education (including PrEP information), condoms, and links to mobile-optimized CDC HIV prevention resources. All participants are scheduled for follow-up assessments at 6 and 12 months, with brief check-ins via text at 2, 4, 8, and 10 months.

Eligibility criteria include age 18–29 years, assigned male sex at birth (any current gender identity), English proficiency, smartphone ownership, self-reported HIV-negative or unknown status (confirmed by baseline HIV testing), and being sexually active and at risk for HIV infection per CDC guidance (e.g., YMSM or YTGW with recent anal sex with men). Individuals with known HIV infection or for whom participation is judged potentially detrimental are excluded.

The primary outcome is the proportion of participants who self-report having been tested for HIV in the previous 6 months. For participants in the mLab App arm, self-reported testing is cross-checked with uploaded test images. The study will describe potential bias in self-report and characterize the app’s test interpretation performance. Secondary analyses include comparing HIV testing frequency across arms, evaluating linkage to care among those with reactive tests (measured as the proportion attending an HIV care appointment and time to linkage), and assessing the sensitivity and specificity of four methods of result interpretation: user self-reading, study team reading of uploaded images, automated mLab algorithm, and confirmatory laboratory testing (gold standard). McNemar’s test will compare paired sensitivities and specificities across these methods.

Analyses will use an intention-to-treat framework. Logistic regression models will compare HIV testing rates between the mLab App arm and control arms, with subgroup analyses by race/ethnicity, age, gender group (YMSM vs YTGW), and risk level. Multiple imputation will address missing data under a missing-at-random assumption, and sensitivity analyses based on selection models for dropout will assess robustness. Because the number of expected HIV-positive cases is relatively small (approximately 25–40), linkage-to-care comparisons may not be powered to detect statistically significant differences.

The trial is conducted under FDA oversight because the mLab App functions as a diagnostic support tool for HIV self-testing. The device operates under an FDA Investigational Device Exemption (IDE #18348), with labeling specifying that the participant’s visual interpretation of the OraQuick test is the reference for their result. The study aims to generate evidence on whether combining at-home HIV testing with a tailored mobile app can increase HIV testing uptake and improve linkage to care among high-risk youth, and to inform the broader use and regulation of mobile medical apps in HIV prevention, particularly in contexts where in-person services are limited, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic.",True,0.94,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
