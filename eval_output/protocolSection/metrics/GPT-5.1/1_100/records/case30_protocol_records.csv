OUTLINE:

STEP I (PRIMARY INTERVENTION STUDY): Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

ARM A: Patients receive web-based genetic education consisting of general information about testing tumors for genetic mutations.

ARM B: Patients receive standard genetic education consisting of conversations with the treating physicians, interaction with and information from the clinical staff, and information from usual resources about testing for genetic mutations.

STEP II (SECONDARY GENETIC COUNSELING SUBSTUDY):

Patients who meet the criteria for the remote counseling substudy will receive genetic counseling over the telephone and undergo germline testing.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.","The Communication and Education in Tumor Profiling (COMET) study (ECOG-ACRIN EAQ152) is a multicenter randomized trial designed to assess the psychosocial and educational impact of a web-based genetic education intervention for patients with advanced cancer undergoing tumor-only genetic sequencing. The study was conducted through the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group and the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP), and was linked to the National Cancer Institute Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (NCI-MATCH, EAY131) precision oncology trial.

Rationale: As massively parallel sequencing has become integrated into precision oncology, tumor genomic profiling is increasingly used to identify actionable mutations and guide targeted therapy. However, there are no established guidelines for pretest counseling for tumor genetic testing, and patients with advanced cancer often have limited understanding of genetic concepts, the distinction between somatic (tumor) and germline testing, and the realistic benefits and limitations of testing. Prior qualitative work has reported misunderstanding, disappointment, distress, and loss of hope following tumor genetic testing, underscoring the need for scalable, patient-centered pretest education. Workforce limitations in genetic counseling and the time-sensitive nature of treatment decisions further support the need for efficient eHealth education strategies.

Intervention: The COMET intervention is a self-directed, mobile-ready, web-based genetic education program informed by the tiered-binned model for genetic education and informed consent. It provides core (tier 1) ""indispensable"" information and optional (tier 2) content to support varying information needs. The linear intervention consists of six modules and four optional videos featuring a genetic counselor, covering topics such as:
- Introduction to the COMET study and the intervention,
- Basic genetics and genomics (DNA, genetic changes, tumor mutations),
- Differences between somatic (tumor) and germline genetic changes,
- The purpose and process of tumor genetic testing,
- Potential findings and what tumor test results may mean for treatment and for family members,
- Potential germline implications of tumor findings,
- Benefits, risks, and limitations of tumor genetic testing,
- Review of key concepts and encouragement to complete surveys.
The content was user-tested in a small group of patients with advanced cancer to ensure clarity and relevance. Participants could navigate the modules flexibly, repeat content as desired, and access links to additional public educational resources (eg, National Cancer Institute, Penn Medicine Diagnostics).

Study Design and Population: From 2016 to 2019, 594 English-speaking adults with advanced cancer and access to email and the web were enrolled across 74 sites. The first 194 participants were drawn from NCI-MATCH before that trial reached its sequencing goal; an additional 400 patients meeting MATCH eligibility criteria were recruited from other site-based tumor sequencing programs once MATCH closed to such accrual. All participants had consented to tumor-only sequencing and had not yet received their tumor genetic results at the time of COMET enrollment.

Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either:
- Arm A (Intervention): Web-based genetic education plus usual care, or
- Arm B (Usual Care): Usual provider education and any information patients sought themselves, without the COMET web intervention.
Randomization was stratified by sex (male vs female), race (White vs non-White), age (≤65 vs >65 years), and education (high school or less vs some college vs post-bachelor). After informed consent and registration, participants completed a baseline (T0) patient-reported outcomes (PRO) survey. Intervention-arm participants were then emailed access to the web program and asked to complete a post-education (T1) survey after using the intervention; if the intervention was not accessed, T1 was sent 9 days after T0. Usual-care-arm participants received T1 six days after T0. Tumor sequencing results were disclosed according to usual clinical practice (typically by the treating oncologist, with no standardized disclosure protocol), and a post-disclosure (T2) survey was administered after research staff documented disclosure or at a time window intended to capture most result returns (approximately 2–3 weeks after expected result availability). Patients were asked to confirm whether they had received results immediately before T2.

Primary Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were changes from baseline in:
1. Genetic knowledge (T0–T1 and T0–T2) using a modified ClinSeq knowledge scale adapted for tumor genetic testing.
2. General anxiety (T0–T1 and T0–T2) measured by 4-item PROMIS Anxiety short form.
3. Depression (T0–T1 and T0–T2) measured by 4-item PROMIS Depression short form.
4. State anxiety (T0–T1 and T0–T2) measured using 20 items from the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (state subscale).
5. Cancer-specific distress (T0–T1 and T0–T2) measured with a 14-item adapted Impact of Event Scale specific to cancer/tumor profiling.

Secondary measures included health literacy (3-item scale, higher scores indicating lower literacy), uncertainty about tumor genetic testing (adapted from the uncertainty subscale of the MICRA), perceived utility of tumor genetic testing (10-item scale assessing perceived usefulness of genetic information), and satisfaction with disclosure of results (9-item adapted scale).

Statistical Analysis: The primary analyses used a two-sample t-test to compare mean change scores between the intervention and usual-care arms for each primary outcome (T0–T1 and T0–T2) using an intention-to-treat framework, regardless of actual intervention uptake. A Bonferroni-corrected two-sided alpha of 0.005 was used for the ten primary comparisons. Sample size calculations based on pilot data suggested that 200 evaluable patients per arm at T1 would yield high power (≥91%) to detect differences in primary outcomes, and 150 evaluable patients per arm at T2 would yield adequate power for key outcomes, particularly cancer-specific distress. Potential baseline imbalances (p<0.1) were to be adjusted via linear regression, though none met this threshold in practice. Moderator analyses used generalized linear models to evaluate two-way interactions between arm and patient factors (age, sex, race, education, health literacy) with a nominal alpha of 0.05 for these exploratory analyses.

Results: Of 594 randomized patients (293 intervention, 301 usual care), 79% completed the baseline survey. The median age was 64 years, 56% were women, 94% identified as White, 45% had common cancers, and 36% had a high school education or less. Most (80%) were enrolled from NCORP community sites. Baseline demographics and primary outcome scores were similar between arms. Among intervention-arm patients with T0 data, 93% accessed the web education. T1 survey completion was 89% in the intervention arm and 88% in usual care; T2 completion was 71% and 66%, respectively.

Primary Efficacy Findings:
- Knowledge: The intervention significantly increased genetic knowledge from T0 to T1 and from T0 to T2 compared with usual care (p<0.0001 and p=0.003, respectively). This effect persisted over time, indicating that web-based education produced sustained improvements in patients' understanding of tumor genetic testing.
- Distress Outcomes: There were no statistically significant differences between arms in changes in general anxiety, depression, state anxiety, or cancer-specific distress in the overall sample for either T0–T1 or T0–T2.

Moderator Analyses:
- Sex: Among women, the intervention produced a greater decrease in cancer-specific distress from T0 to T1 compared with usual care (mean change −2.4 vs +0.9; p=0.01), suggesting that web-based education can mitigate cancer-related distress in female patients. No such effect was seen in men (interaction p=0.052), indicating potential sex-specific differences in response to the intervention.
- Health Literacy: Lower health literacy moderated intervention effects adversely. Patients with lower health literacy in the intervention arm showed greater increases in cancer-specific distress from T0 to T1 and greater increases in depression from T0 to T2, and experienced less improvement (and possibly slight worsening) in general anxiety compared with similar patients in the usual-care arm. Baseline distress was also higher among lower-literacy participants, independent of treatment arm. These relationships remained significant after adjusting for baseline distress, suggesting that the negative moderating effect of low literacy is not solely explained by pre-existing anxiety or depression.

Secondary Outcomes: No significant between-arm differences were observed in changes in uncertainty about tumor genetic testing, perceived utility of testing, or satisfaction with result disclosure. Many patients did not clearly recall whether results had been formally disclosed, highlighting the complexity and variability of disclosure practices in routine oncology care.

Conclusions and Implications: This study demonstrates that a scalable, web-based genetic education tool can effectively increase patient knowledge regarding tumor genomic profiling in a large, predominantly community-based advanced cancer population. While the intervention did not significantly reduce distress outcomes overall, it decreased cancer-specific distress among women, indicating potential benefits for selected subgroups. At the same time, patients with lower health literacy experienced transient increases in distress and less improvement in anxiety and depression after the intervention, emphasizing the need to tailor eHealth genetic education to literacy levels and to integrate additional psychosocial support for vulnerable groups.

The COMET study provides empirical data to inform practice guidelines for pretest education in tumor genomic testing, suggesting that web-based platforms can complement oncology providers by delivering standardized, accessible information. Future refinements could include simplification of language, alternative formats for low-literacy populations, and targeted interventions for men and those with higher baseline distress. Further research is needed to standardize and optimize the disclosure of tumor sequencing results and to evaluate how educational interventions interact with different types of test results (e.g., actionable vs nonactionable findings, potential germline implications) and testing modalities (tumor-only vs paired tumor-germline).",True,0.93,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
