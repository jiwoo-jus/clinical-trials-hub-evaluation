GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,TP,TP,"To improve neonatal mortality, it is critical to engage families, especially mothers, in essential newborn care (ENC) and appropriate care-seeking for neonatal illness as well as to support maternal mental health and self-efficacy. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to determine the effect and mechanisms of a two- way mobile health (mHealth) SMS intervention, Mobile WACh NEO, on neonatal mortality, essential newborn practices, care-seeking and maternal mental health at four sites in Kenya.","This is a two-arm, individually randomised controlled trial in Kenya evaluating Mobile WACh NEO, an interactive (two-way) SMS messaging intervention for pregnant women and new mothers. About 5000 women in their third trimester are randomised 1:1 to receive tailored SMS messages during pregnancy and up to 6 weeks after delivery, or to receive no SMS (standard care). The messages provide information, motivation and behavioural skills to support essential newborn care, early recognition of neonatal danger signs, appropriate care-seeking, and maternal psychosocial well-being. The main hypothesis is that the SMS intervention will reduce neonatal mortality by improving essential newborn care practices, timely care-seeking, maternal social support, self-efficacy and reducing perinatal depression.",True,0.94,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"High-impact essential newborn care practices and interventions are available to support neonatal survival, but coverage remains a challenge in sub-Saharan Africa, where neonatal mortality is unacceptably high. Many newborns continue to die at home without health care services being sought. The reasons are multifactorial, at the societal, health system, and family levels. Decisions made within the household and the family's ability to reach care play a large part in determining neonatal outcomes. It is estimated that up to 80% of neonatal and child deaths may have delays in recognition of infant illness and decision to seek care. Two-way mobile health (mHealth) communication strategies can enable mothers to remotely interact with a healthcare worker (HCW) and receive real-time education, counseling, encouragement, motivation and decisional guidance to support care-seeking decisions and ultimately neonatal health and survival.

The investigators developed a unique two-way SMS platform (Mobile WACh) that combines automated SMS messaging and dialogue with a HCW. The team adapted this approach for intensive neonatal support and evaluations (Mobile WACh NEO). Mobile WACh NEO (MWN) enhances the benefits of SMS messaging by engaging mothers with SMS communication and bringing timely information and support - asking critical questions at crucial times in order to assess the needs and health of newborns and assist in care seeking decisions.

This is a randomized controlled trial of the MWN intervention among 5,020 participants (2,510 MWN arm, 2,510 control arm) to determine the effect of MWN on neonatal mortality, essential newborn care, care seeking, and maternal mental health in the first 6 weeks postpartum.

Aim 1: To determine the effect of Mobile WACh NEO on neonatal mortality, compared to no SMS control.

Aim 2: To examine the effect of Mobile WACh NEO on maternal implementation of essential newborn care and care seeking behavior.

Aim 3: To examine the effects of Mobile WACh NEO on maternal social support, self-efficacy and depression.

Finally, investigators will explore the associations between maternal mental health, implementation of essential newborn care, neonatal care seeking and participant engagement by SMS.","Mobile WACh NEO is a multisite, parallel-group, superiority randomised controlled trial conducted at six health facilities in Kenya (urban Nairobi and rural Western Kenya). The trial targets pregnant women aged 14 years and older who are 28–36 weeks’ gestation, enrolled in antenatal care at a study site, have daily access to a Safaricom mobile phone, are willing to receive SMS, plan to remain in the area for at least 5 months, and are not enrolled in another study. Literacy is not required if a trusted person can read and send messages on the participant’s behalf.

Participants (n=5000) are randomised 1:1 to an interactive two-way SMS intervention (Mobile WACh NEO) or a control group with no study SMS. Randomisation is stratified by site, uses variable block sizes, and is implemented via a web-based system; participants and site staff are unblinded, but investigators are blinded to aggregate results until study completion.

The intervention consists of semi-automated, tailored SMS messages informed by the Information-Motivation-Behaviour Skills (IMB) model. Messages are sent in English, Kiswahili or Dholuo according to participant preference and are tailored to gestational age or postpartum age, with different frequencies across periods: weekly from enrolment until 38 weeks’ gestation, daily from 38 weeks to delivery, twice daily from delivery to 2 weeks postpartum, and every other day from 2 to 6 weeks postpartum. Content focuses on essential newborn care (ENC)—including early and exclusive breastfeeding, thermal care, delayed bathing, clean cord care, and kangaroo mother care for preterm/low birth weight infants—identification of neonatal danger signs, birth planning and facility delivery, and maternal mental health, social support and self-efficacy. Messages are interactive and typically contain questions prompting engagement.

Participants in the intervention arm can send SMS at any time; trained study nurses respond during business hours using a human–computer hybrid platform that supports two-way communication, templated responses for common issues, and triage. Nurses prioritise messages indicating maternal or neonatal danger signs, serious adverse events, or home delivery, and refer participants to facility care when appropriate. Participants reporting intimate partner violence, suicidal ideation, severe depressive symptoms or severe food insecurity are referred to local resources. High-risk messaging tracks provide additional tailored content for first-time or very young mothers (≤19 years), women screening positive for elevated depressive symptoms, and mothers of preterm or low birth weight infants. If a pregnancy or infant loss occurs, automated messages stop and women are offered an alternative track with supportive condolence messages and no pregnancy or infant-care content.

The primary outcome is neonatal mortality, defined as death within the first 28 days after a live birth, ascertained from clinic records and maternal report, with verbal autopsy conducted for infant deaths. Secondary outcomes include: early neonatal mortality (death within 7 days); early initiation of breastfeeding (within 1 hour of birth); delayed bathing (≥24 hours after birth); avoidance of substances on the umbilical cord; time to cessation of breastfeeding; provision of kangaroo mother care for preterm or low birth weight infants; maternal knowledge of neonatal danger signs; maternal depressive symptoms measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; social support measured by the MOS Social Support Scale; and parenting self-efficacy measured by the Karitane Parenting Confidence Scale. Exploratory analyses will evaluate relationships between maternal mental health, ENC practices, care-seeking, and intervention engagement.

Data are collected at enrolment (third trimester) and at 2 and 6 weeks postpartum via tablet-based questionnaires, supplemented by abstraction of clinical records (including maternity registers, maternal and child health booklets, and hospital discharge forms). Follow-up visits are conducted in conjunction with routine clinical visits when possible or via phone; home tracing is employed when needed, though in-person home visits were suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic according to national guidance.

The planned sample size of 5000 participants provides 80% power (alpha=0.05, assuming 10% attrition) to detect a risk ratio of ≤0.53 in neonatal mortality, based on an assumed control-arm neonatal mortality rate of 23 per 1000 live births. Power calculations for secondary outcomes are based on Bonferroni adjustment; analyses of secondary endpoints will ultimately use Benjamini–Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons. The primary analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle and use log-binomial regression for risk outcomes, Cox proportional hazards for breastfeeding duration, Poisson models for counts, and linear models for continuous psychosocial scores, with generalised estimating equations where appropriate. Sensitivity analyses will explore the impact of loss to follow-up on neonatal mortality, and an exploratory per-protocol analysis will exclude women who discontinue the SMS intervention. An interim analysis for neonatal mortality is planned using O’Brien–Fleming stopping boundaries when approximately 50% of person-time has accrued.

Safety is monitored via systematic collection of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), including pregnancy loss, maternal or infant hospitalisation or death. SAEs are reported promptly to relevant ethics committees. A Data Safety Monitoring Board composed of independent experts in biostatistics, maternal–child health, paediatrics and mHealth oversees trial safety.

The trial is approved by institutional review boards at the University of Washington, Women and Infants Hospital, and Kenyatta National Hospital/University of Nairobi, and is registered under NCT04598165. The investigators plan to disseminate findings through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and policy briefs for Kenyan health authorities, with the goal of informing scalable strategies to reduce neonatal mortality and improve maternal and newborn health in resource-limited settings.",True,0.92,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
