TPE was started within 24 hours of ICU admission and was followed by a 500 ml ABO‑compatible CVP transfusion. The primary endpoint was 30‑day survival; secondary endpoints were changes in oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2 ratio) and inflammatory markers (C‑reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin) at 7 days.

GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"This single centre prospective, non-randomised controlled trial will be conducted in an 8 bed COVID-19 ICU and will include patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring ICU monitoring and therapy. 19 patients will be treated performing TPE followed by CVP transfusion while for 19 patients will receive standard treatment according to hospital protocols. TPE will be initiated during the first 24 hours after ICU admission, followed immediately by transfusion of CVP. The primary endpoint is survival at 30 days. Secondary endpoints include assessing the evolution of biomarkers, such as the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio (P/F ratio), C reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ferritin at the 7-day follow-up.","This study was a single-centre, prospective, non-randomized controlled trial conducted in an 8‑bed dedicated COVID‑19 intensive care unit at the ‘Dr Teodor Andrei’ Municipal Hospital, Lugoj, Romania, between August 8, 2020, and January 9, 2021. It included 38 adult Caucasian patients (>18 years) with confirmed SARS‑CoV‑2 infection by RT‑PCR on admission, who presented with acute respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS was defined as acute-onset hypoxemia with a PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio <300 mmHg, >50% bilateral pulmonary opacities on chest imaging within 24–48 hours not fully explained by congestive heart failure, and the need for ICU care. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, suspected or confirmed pulmonary embolism, and terminal disease.

Patients were divided equally, in a non-randomized fashion, into two groups. The treatment group (n=19) received a single session of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) followed immediately by convalescent plasma (CVP) transfusion, in addition to standard COVID‑19 therapy. The control group (n=19) received standard therapy alone, according to hospital protocols. Standard treatment included corticosteroids (dexamethasone 16 mg/day), therapeutic-dose low molecular weight heparin (nadroparin adjusted to bodyweight), antiretrovirals (lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir), hydroxychloroquine, and empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics when infection was suspected, with de-escalation based on culture results.

In the treatment group, TPE was initiated within the first 24 hours after ICU admission. Vascular access was obtained using a dual‑lumen 14‑French catheter placed in the femoral vein under ultrasound guidance. TPE was performed using an Infomed HF 440 machine with a plasma/blood separation ratio of 20%, and 40 ml/kg of fresh frozen plasma was used as replacement fluid. Systemic anticoagulation during the procedure used unfractionated heparin. After completing TPE, each patient received 500 ml of ABO‑compatible CVP, with neutralizing antibody titres ranging from 1:80 to 1:160, levels considered acceptable at the time if higher-titre units were not available. Patients were monitored closely during and after TPE and CVP for hemodynamic instability and other complications.

The primary endpoint was survival at 30 days. Secondary endpoints included the evolution of oxygenation (P/F ratio) and inflammatory biomarkers—C‑reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and ferritin—assessed at admission and on day 7. Normal reference ranges were CRP 0–5 mg/l, LDH 135–225 U/l, and ferritin 30–400 µg/l. All patients initially received high-flow nasal oxygen (30 l/min, FiO2 1.0) plus a non‑rebreathing mask, with a median baseline P/F ratio around 60.

Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups in terms of age, sex distribution, comorbidities (including arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and obesity), severity category (severe vs critical), disease stage (Siddiqi and Mehra stages IIb and III), APACHE II score, time from symptom onset to treatment (median 8 days), and use of antiviral drugs. Body mass index (BMI) was higher in the treatment group but other variables were balanced.

At 30 days, survival was 47.37% (9/19) in the TPE+CVP group versus 26.32% (5/19) in the control group. Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated a statistically significant difference in survival between groups (log‑rank P=0.002). Cox regression analysis showed that treatment with TPE plus CVP was associated with a significantly reduced hazard of death (hazard ratio 0.39; 95% CI 0.16–0.91; P=0.007).

Regarding secondary endpoints, patients in the treatment group exhibited improved oxygenation and decreased markers of systemic inflammation at day 7 compared with controls. The P/F ratio increased more markedly in the treatment group, with a between‑group difference on the threshold of statistical significance (P=0.052). CRP and LDH levels showed statistically significant reductions in the TPE+CVP group relative to the control group. Ferritin levels were higher at baseline in the treatment group but tended to decrease over 7 days, whereas they remained relatively constant in controls; however, the between‑group difference in ferritin change was not statistically significant (P=0.962). These trends were illustrated in graphical analyses comparing admission and day 7 values.

Complications directly attributable to TPE and CVP were minimal. One patient (5.26%) in the treatment group developed transient hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg) after CVP transfusion, which was successfully managed with crystalloid fluid bolus. ICU‑acquired infections occurred in 14 patients (73.68%) in the treatment group and 10 patients (52.63%) in the control group.

Mean ICU length of stay (LOS) was longer in the treatment group (16.84 ± 7.25 days) than in the control group (8.58 ± 6.13 days; P=0.001). The authors attribute this apparent paradox, as well as differences in mechanical ventilation durations, to higher early mortality in the control group—7 control patients (36.84%) died by day 7, thus shortening measured LOS and ventilation times in that arm.

The authors discuss the pathophysiologic rationale for combining TPE and CVP in severe COVID‑19. In advanced stages, SARS‑CoV‑2 infection can provoke systemic hyperinflammation, cytokine storm, dysregulated coagulation, ARDS, and multiorgan failure. TPE may rapidly remove circulating inflammatory cytokines, pathological coagulation factors, and potentially harmful autoantibodies, while fresh frozen plasma may replenish protective factors such as ADAMTS‑13, protein C, and angiopoietin‑1. Immediately following TPE with CVP transfusion introduces neutralizing antibodies against SARS‑CoV‑2, potentially reducing viral load and shifting the antigen–antibody balance. The authors reference prior work showing improved outcomes with early TPE or CVP alone, and note that their trial is among the first to evaluate a sequential TPE followed by CVP strategy.

They acknowledge concerns that TPE may also remove beneficial immunoglobulins and complement components, potentially impairing adaptive immunity, but argue that replacement with fresh frozen plasma and subsequent CVP infusion may counterbalance this effect by reintroducing protective factors and virus‑specific antibodies.

The study concludes that early initiation of TPE followed by CVP transfusion in severe and critical ICU COVID‑19 patients is associated with improved 30‑day survival, better oxygenation, and reduced inflammatory markers, suggesting that this combined approach may represent a viable rescue therapy. Key limitations include the small sample size, single‑centre design, non-randomized allocation, retrospective trial registration, relatively low neutralizing antibody titres in CVP units, and potential confounding from concurrent treatments such as corticosteroids and various antivirals. The authors call for larger randomized controlled trials to confirm these findings and to more precisely define the role of combined TPE and CVP in the management of severe and critically ill COVID‑19 patients.",True,0.94,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
