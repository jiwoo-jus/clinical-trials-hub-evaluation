Then the investigators will test the reminders in primary care clinics to see if they improve treatment of high blood pressure in early chronic kidney disease.

Hypothesis: The mean systolic blood pressure of the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population can be decreased by an intervention with three innovative features: 1) methods to synthesize EHR data in order to identify under-diagnosed chronic conditions, 2) iterative improvement in clinical decision support (CDS) content through human factors methods to maximize the ""informativeness"" of the CDS, and 3) the use of behavioral economic principles to create behavioral ""nudges"" internal and external to the CDS.","This pragmatic, multicentre cluster-randomised controlled trial tests a multicomponent electronic health record–based clinical decision support (CDS) intervention to improve management of uncontrolled hypertension in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in primary care. Primary care clinicians at 15 practices are randomised at the clinician (or clinician dyad) level to receive either an active Epic Best Practice Advisory CDS or usual care. The intervention uses computable phenotypes to identify CKD patients with uncontrolled systolic blood pressure and then provides tailored treatment recommendations, including initiation or up-titration of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics, along with guideline links and explanations. Behavioural economic components include pre-commitment emails asking clinicians to pledge adherence to blood pressure management recommendations and accountable justification text fields when they disagree with CDS suggestions. The primary outcome is change in mean systolic blood pressure from baseline to 6 months. Secondary outcomes include hypertension- and CKD-related process measures, adverse drug events, and hypotension, evaluated using the RE-AIM implementation science framework.",True,0.93,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"Specific Aim 1: To develop and validate the intervention. Specific Aim 1a: To develop and validate the CDS that will: 1) synthesize existing laboratory tests, medication orders, and vital sign data; 2) increase recognition of CKD, 3) increase recognition of uncontrolled HTN in CKD patients; and 4) deliver evidence-based CKD and hypertension (HTN) management recommendations.

Specific Aim 1b: To improve the design and content of the CDS, we will use human factors methods, specifically usability testing.

Specific Aim 1c: To develop a ""wrap-around"" intervention including two behavioral ""nudges"": 1) pre-checked default orders, and 2) an email to obtain commitment from primary care providers (PCPs) to obtain their commitment to follow the CDS recommendations.

Aim 1a Study Procedures:

Develop Rules for Evidence-based Recommendations for HTN in CKD: The investigators will leverage past work that they have done in a study that delivered recommendations based on national guidelines. An example of one of the rules is to determine whether anti-hypertensive agents have been prescribed but are not at highest potency. If so, the CDS will deliver a recommendation to increase the dosage. The investigators will also include one-click access to recommended orders.

Implementation: Before the start of the trial, the CDS will be moved to the Production environment in ""silent mode"" where it will record when it would fire, but it will not be displayed to the user. This step will allow us to validate that the rules are accurately identifying patients and producing the correct recommendations through a chart review. The CDS will be activated in the Production environment on the start date of the clinical trial in Aim 2.

Aim 1b Study Procedures:

Usability Test Procedure: Usability testing clinical scenarios will be developed by subject matter experts. Contextual inquiry sessions will be conducted with PCPs and the investigators will ask for feedback on the usability test procedure, as well as content of test scenarios. The goal of Aim 1b is to iteratively improve other important aspects of the CDS that contribute to the overall informativeness of the CDS. The investigators will conduct two rounds of usability testing with PCPs. After each test, the research team and Epic build specialist will make iterative changes to the content of the CDS and layout of information.

Qualitative analysis: Qualitative methods will be employed to analyze the data. The transcripts will be organized by task and participant and then quotes will be identified that illustrate a user expectation, frustration, or misinterpretation of content or functionality.

Aim 1c Study Procedures:

1. Pre-checked, no-action default: The first nudge will be part of the CDS. The investigators will display the CDS with certain options pre-selected.
2. Pledge email to obtain commitment from PCPs to follow the CDS recommendations: As a starting point, we need to ensure that PCPs are aware of the clinical practice guidelines. At the beginning of the study, we will send an advertisement email to all PCPs in the network. In addition, as part of the intervention, we will ask intervention arm PCPs to commit to following the recommendations presented to them in the best practices advisory (BPA), or writing their rationale in the CDS if they choose not to. By clicking a link in an email, the intervention PCP will come to a REDCap survey asking them to type their name to pledge to consider the CDS recommendations provided in our BPAs. The control PCPs will receive a control email without the specific details about the study and without the REDCap link.

Specific Aim 2: To test the effectiveness of the intervention. Specific Aim 2a: To evaluate whether the intervention developed in Aim 1 significantly decreases mean systolic blood pressure in a population of CKD patients with blood pressure \> 140/90. They will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in a pragmatic, cluster-randomized controlled trial, randomized at the level of the physician. Secondary outcomes will include hypertension-specific process measures, such as treatment intensification.

Specific Aim 2b: To evaluate whether the intervention improves process measures for quality of CKD care including: annual serum creatinine test, and annual urine albumin test.

Specific Aim 2 Study Procedures Please see below for detailed description of the clinical trial.","This study evaluates a multicomponent intervention designed to improve control of hypertension among adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in real-world primary care settings. The trial is conducted within the Brigham and Women’s Primary Care Practice-Based Research Network, which includes 15 diverse practices. The design is a pragmatic, cluster-randomised controlled trial, with randomisation at the clinician level (including solo primary care clinicians and co-management dyads) to minimise contamination and align with the clinician-focused nature of the intervention.

Eligible patients are adults (≥18 years) with CKD, defined by two prior estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values of 16–59 mL/min/1.73 m² or two urine albumin-to-creatinine ratios (UACR) >30 mg/g at least 90 days apart, who also have uncontrolled hypertension, defined as at least one systolic blood pressure (SBP) >140 mm Hg in the prior 2 years and SBP >140 mm Hg at the enrolment visit. Patients with very advanced kidney dysfunction (eGFR ≤20 most recent or two eGFRs ≤15 mL/min/1.73 m² separated by at least 90 days) are excluded. Patients are automatically enrolled at the time of qualifying primary care visits, with group assignment based on their clinician’s randomisation status.

The core of the intervention is a set of Epic Best Practice Advisories (BPAs) built on five computable phenotypes that identify CKD patients with uncontrolled SBP who would benefit from: (1) initiation of an ACE inhibitor (ACEi), (2) initiation of an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), (3) up-titration of a suboptimal ACEi dose, (4) up-titration of a suboptimal ARB dose, and (5) addition of a diuretic when ACEi or ARB therapy is maximised. When a qualifying patient’s chart is opened by an intervention clinician, the BPA displays patient-specific information explaining why it fired, structured treatment recommendations (for example, a suggested ACEi starting dose or ARB dose increase), and hyperlinks to relevant CKD and hypertension clinical guidelines.

User-centred design methods were used to develop and refine the CDS interface, including contextual inquiry of clinical workflows, group design sessions, and individual “think aloud” usability testing. These methods informed how data are displayed, how recommendations are framed, and how clinicians interact with the advisory. Behavioural economic principles are incorporated through default options, accountability, and public commitment: clinicians receive a pre-commitment email inviting them to pledge adherence to blood pressure treatment recommendations, and the BPA requires an ‘accountable justification’ if a clinician declines a recommendation, encouraging explicit documentation of the rationale. The CDS fires at the initial enrolment visit; follow-up firing occurs only if the clinician requests a reminder and if the patient still meets criteria (for example, persistent SBP >140/90 mm Hg and no newly documented contraindications or target medication use).

Implementation was preceded by a silent-mode period and a short live pilot during which the CDS ran without being visible (for validation) and then was briefly activated to evaluate clinician interactions and uncover workflow issues and potential workarounds. Observed workarounds included selecting ‘other’ as a justification with non-informative text or initiating but not signing medication orders to dismiss the alert. These observations inform the assessment of real-world adoption and alert fatigue but did not lead to substantive modifications of the CDS logic for the main trial.

Outcomes are evaluated within the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. The primary clinical endpoint is the change in mean SBP from baseline (prior year mean SBP) to 6 months, comparing intervention and control arms using generalised estimating equations that account for patient clustering within clinicians. Secondary outcomes include hypertension management process measures (for example, initiation or intensification of ACEi/ARB or diuretics, ordering of basic metabolic panels), CKD quality-of-care processes (for example, annual urine albumin testing), adverse drug events, and hypotension. Additional RE-AIM outcomes include reach (number and types of clinicians and patients exposed to the CDS), adoption (patterns of BPA acceptance, rejection, and justification), implementation (fidelity, barriers, workarounds, unintended consequences), and maintenance (sustainability of CDS use and integration into workflow over time).

Sample size calculations assumed an expected clinically meaningful 3 mm Hg greater reduction in SBP in the intervention arm compared with usual care, an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.1, and an average of six patients per clinician, yielding a requirement of approximately 497 evaluable patients per arm to achieve >80% power. Analyses will be primarily intent-to-intervene, with secondary analyses including multiple imputation for patients without follow-up visits, as-treated analyses based on actual clinician ordering behaviour, and clinician-level analyses. The trial received expedited ethical approval; patient-level informed consent was waived due to the pragmatic, clinician-level randomisation, and a Data Safety Monitoring Board oversees safety and potential harms such as hypotension and medication-related adverse events.",True,0.97,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
