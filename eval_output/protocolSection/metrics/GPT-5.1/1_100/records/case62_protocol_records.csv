Adult patients (age ≥18 years, ASA I–III) scheduled for elective laparoscopic left colectomy for neoplasm or diverticulitis were enrolled after informed consent. Key exclusion criteria included morbid obesity (BMI >35), multiple prior abdominal operations, preoperative anticoagulation, coagulopathy, pregnancy, and any contraindication to electrosurgery.

Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio using permuted blocks to Group 1 (THUNDERBEAT) or Group 2 (LigaSure). All procedures used standardized laparoscopic equipment and preset generator settings. Surgeons were experienced colorectal laparoscopists and had used each device on at least 10 patients prior to the trial.

Two primary outcomes were defined. The first was dissection time to specimen removal (DTSR), measured in minutes from the start of colon mobilization to removal of the specimen from the abdominal cavity. The second was a versatility score, a composite metric (range 1–5 per segment, 1 worst to 5 best) incorporating five weighted domains: hemostasis (0.275), sealing (0.275), cutting (0.2), dissection (0.15), and tissue manipulation (0.1). Versatility was evaluated for six predefined surgical segments of left colectomy, including inferior mesenteric artery/vein pedicle division, retroperitoneal dissection, omental dissection/resection, splenic flexure takedown, lateral colonic dissection, and mesenteric/pelvic dissection. Segment-wise scores were averaged to obtain an overall versatility score. A mean score ≥3.5 was considered high versatility.

Secondary measures included a global ""drier surgical field"" score (1–5) assessing overall oozing and bleeding, detailed vessel sealing performance (number of activations and success of sealing for left colic, sigmoid, superior rectal arteries, and IMA/IMV), estimated blood loss, the need for instrument exchanges, and intraoperative complications including device-related bleeding or thermal injury. Postoperative outcomes comprised gastrointestinal recovery (time to first flatus, bowel movement, and solid food), 30-day complications graded by Clavien–Dindo (including anastomotic leak, rectal bleeding, ileus, wound hematoma, urinary tract infection), reoperation, readmission, length of stay, and mortality. Coagulation parameters (PT, PTT, INR) were checked preoperatively. Follow-up was 30 days for all patients.

Surgeon-reported device usability was assessed immediately postoperatively using an 8-item survey (1–10 scale) covering handle operation, maneuverability, weight balance, fatigue/pain from handle use, ease of activating seal/cut buttons, ease of turning the rotation knob, confidence in sealing large vessels (>5 mm), and overall satisfaction.

A total of 73 patients were enrolled between February 2016 and April 2019; 13 were withdrawn before randomization for reasons such as surgery cancellation or change in surgical plan. Sixty patients were randomized and analyzed (31 THUNDERBEAT, 29 LigaSure). Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics (age, sex, BMI, ASA class, diagnosis, comorbidities) were similar between groups. All procedures were initiated laparoscopically; a small number were converted to open surgery in each group without significant between-group difference.

There was no statistically significant difference in the primary time outcome. Median DTSR was 91 minutes (range 41–172) for THUNDERBEAT vs 77 minutes (38–175) for LigaSure (p=0.214). Total operative time was also similar: 176 vs 170 minutes (p=0.311). The authors note that a post hoc power analysis suggested the study was underpowered to detect relatively small time differences.

Regarding versatility, both devices achieved high overall scores. THUNDERBEAT had a slightly higher overall versatility mean score (4.8±0.18 vs 4.7±0.22, p=0.045). THUNDERBEAT also showed significantly better scores in segment 3 (omental dissection/resection) overall versatility (4.9±0.25 vs 4.7±0.39, p=0.041), as well as in specific subcomponents of segment 3: dissection (p=0.011) and tissue manipulation (p=0.026). In segment 6 (mesenteric/pelvic dissection), THUNDERBEAT had a higher sealing score (p=0.023). These differences were numerically small and judged by the authors as not clinically consequential given that both devices scored in the high versatility range.

The dryness of the surgical field, estimated blood loss, need for intraoperative transfusion, and rates of bleeding during sealing or mesenteric dissection were similar between groups. Vessel sealing of major mesenteric vessels (IMA/IMV and branches) was successful in over 93% of cases in both groups, with comparable numbers of applications needed. In rare instances of heavily calcified vessels, additional clips were required in both arms.

No intraoperative or postoperative complications were directly attributed to device failure or thermal injury. Concerns about higher jaw temperatures and thermal spread with ultrasonic energy were not borne out clinically in this series. Postoperative outcomes—including return of bowel function, length of hospital and postsurgical stay, 30-day complication rates (including anastomotic leaks and postoperative rectal bleeding), reoperations, and readmissions—did not differ significantly between THUNDERBEAT and LigaSure. No deaths occurred.

Surgeon surveys indicated a preference for THUNDERBEAT in several handling aspects: ease of opening/closing the handle (p=0.012), maneuverability (p<0.0001), and ease of pressing seal/cut buttons (p=0.007), as well as higher overall satisfaction (p=0.015). LigaSure showed a nonsignificant trend toward less hand fatigue and pain. The authors caution that these usability findings may be influenced by surgeon familiarity and preference, as only five surgeons participated and one highly experienced surgeon operated on about half the patients.

The study concludes that both THUNDERBEAT and Maryland LigaSure are safe and effective energy devices for soft tissue division and mesenteric vessel sealing in laparoscopic left colectomy. No meaningful difference was found in operative time or complication rates. THUNDERBEAT demonstrated some advantages in omental dissection, tissue manipulation, and certain aspects of usability, but these did not translate into clear clinical superiority.
