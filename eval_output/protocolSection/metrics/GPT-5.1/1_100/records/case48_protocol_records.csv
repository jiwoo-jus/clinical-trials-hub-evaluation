One hundred adults with elevated blood pressure identified during their preadmission testing for surgery were randomized to either brief counseling plus an educational brochure about hypertension or the same counseling and brochure plus provision of a home blood pressure monitor with feedback of home readings. At about 60 days after surgery, participants were contacted to determine if they had seen their primary care provider, whether hypertension treatment had been started or adjusted, and how satisfied they were with the interventions. The study found that both preoperative counseling and home blood pressure monitoring were acceptable to patients, home monitoring was completed and devices were largely returned, and many patients had primary care follow-up and treatment changes. However, telephone follow-up had substantial loss to follow-up, suggesting that future larger trials may need to rely more on electronic health record data.",True,0.86,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"The intervention and control groups will be defined by, 1) preoperative home blood pressure monitoring with a detailed report sent to the patient, and 2) usual standard of care including a suggestion during the pre-operative clinic appointment to follow up with Primary Care. Both groups will receive a brief questionnaire about their blood pressure treatment and medication adherence. We will examine the rate of primary care follow-up and changes in hypertension treatment at 60 days post-operative, through a telephone call. This information, along with information regarding patient acceptance of the intervention will be used to inform the design of a future clinical trial powered to outcomes, including follow-up visits and blood pressure management.","This prospective, randomized feasibility trial was conducted at the Yale New Haven Hospital Preadmission Testing Clinic between November 2018 and November 2019. The primary aim was to assess the feasibility of a perioperative blood pressure intervention and the baseline rates of primary care follow-up after such interventions in adults presenting for elective surgery with elevated clinic blood pressure. Secondary aims included evaluating the practicality of home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) in this setting, determining the proportion of patients with confirmed hypertension at home, describing post-operative changes in hypertension management, and assessing patient satisfaction with the interventions.

Eligible participants were adults (>18 years) who could understand English and had a clinic blood pressure of at least 140 mmHg systolic or 90 mmHg diastolic, based on the mean of two automated oscillometric measurements taken 5 minutes apart at the preadmission visit. Exclusion criteria included inability or unwillingness to operate a brachial artery HBPM device, inability to provide informed consent, or a scheduled surgery date within 48 hours of the preoperative visit.

After informed consent, participants completed a questionnaire including a validated measure of antihypertensive medication adherence. They were randomized 1:1, stratified by gender, into two arms. The counseling arm received brief counseling about their elevated blood pressure and the need for follow-up, followed by a mailed follow-up letter and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute brochure ""Your Guide to Lowering Blood Pressure,"" which covers diet, exercise, lifestyle modification, and other strategies to improve blood pressure control. The HBPM arm received the same educational brochure at enrollment and an Omron MX3 model BP742 home blood pressure monitor. Participants in the HBPM group were instructed on device use and asked to obtain resting blood pressure measurements in the morning and evening each day from enrollment until the day of surgery, and to return the device on the surgery date. The HBPM devices stored up to 50 time-stamped readings.

For the purposes of this trial, sustained elevated home blood pressure was defined a priori as mean systolic home BP ≥135 mmHg or mean diastolic home BP ≥85 mmHg, based on prior literature linking similar HBPM thresholds to increased cardiovascular risk. Following surgery, HBPM participants received a mailed summary of their mean home blood pressure. Unless the home readings showed sustained normotension, these letters encouraged participants to follow up with their primary care physician (PCP) to discuss blood pressure management.

At 60 days post-surgery, investigators attempted telephone follow-up. The structured telephone questionnaire assessed: (a) whether the participant had seen a PCP; (b) whether new antihypertensive therapy had been initiated or existing therapy adjusted; and (c) patient satisfaction and perceived helpfulness of the brochure, HBPM (if applicable), and follow-up call, using Likert-type scales. If participants could not be reached after three call attempts, their electronic health record (EHR) was reviewed for evidence of PCP visits and hypertension treatment changes; if none were found, these outcomes were coded as missing.

A total of 100 participants were enrolled (mean age ~65 years; 54% female). Baseline clinic blood pressures were in the mid-150s systolic and around 90 mmHg diastolic in both arms. Most participants already had a PCP and a prior diagnosis of hypertension, and approximately 80% were on antihypertensive medication with high self-reported adherence. Forty-nine participants were randomized to HBPM and 51 to counseling. Return of HBPM devices was high: 46 of 49 devices (94%) were returned, and the median number of home readings per participant was 26. Among those who returned monitors, 78% met the study’s definition of elevated home blood pressure, indicating that most patients with elevated preoperative clinic pressures also had sustained hypertension at home.

At 60 days, telephone contact was achieved for 31 of 51 (61%) counseling participants and 30 of 49 (61%) HBPM participants, highlighting substantial attrition with phone-based follow-up. Using both phone and EHR data, 71% of counseling patients and 73% of HBPM patients had seen their PCP postoperatively. Among those who had a PCP visit, the majority discussed hypertension management. Across the trial, 35 patients had new or adjusted antihypertensive treatment at follow-up (47% of those answering in the counseling group and 58% in the HBPM group), including initiation of medication in a subset who were not previously treated. This suggests that preoperative identification and counseling of patients with elevated blood pressure may stimulate ongoing hypertension management, though the study was not designed or powered to compare clinical outcomes between arms.

Patient-reported acceptance of the interventions was high. Among 61 participants reached by phone, 85% were neutral to very satisfied with their involvement in the study. Most respondents recalled the NIH brochure and reported implementing diet and exercise changes consistent with its recommendations, though these self-reports may include continuation rather than initiation of behaviors. Participants in the HBPM arm overwhelmingly rated the device as easy to use, although about 15% described HBPM use around the time of surgery as an added stressor.

The investigators concluded that randomized blood pressure interventions in the preoperative clinic are feasible, that HBPM can be implemented with high adherence and high device return, and that both interventions are generally well accepted by patients. However, the added diagnostic value of preoperative-period HBPM over preoperative clinic blood pressure measurements remains uncertain, especially given that most patients with elevated clinic BP also had elevated home readings. The study also underscored the limitations of telephone follow-up, which resulted in a 39% failure to reach participants, and suggested that future larger pragmatic studies may need to emphasize EHR-based outcome ascertainment, particularly within integrated health systems.

The trial population had higher than average primary care engagement and antihypertensive treatment and adherence compared with the general U.S. population, which may limit generalizability. Additional limitations include exclusion of non-English speakers and potential unmeasured language barriers, as well as recruitment challenges inherent in coordinating with busy preadmission workflows. Overall, the study supports the feasibility and acceptability of preoperative hypertension screening and counseling, and it provides data to inform the design, recruitment strategies, and follow-up methods for larger trials aimed at improving long-term cardiovascular risk management in surgical patients with hypertension.",True,0.86,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
