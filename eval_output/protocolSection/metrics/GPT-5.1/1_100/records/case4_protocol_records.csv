GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,TP,TP,Open label multi center study for the donation of HCV positive kidneys to HCV negative recipients with interventional treatment to prevent HCV transmission upon transplantation.,"This multicenter, open-label clinical trial (MYTHIC, NCT03781726) evaluated the safety, effectiveness, and clinical impact of transplanting kidneys from hepatitis C virus (HCV) viremic deceased donors into HCV-negative recipients, followed by early direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. Thirty HCV RNA–positive donor to HCV-negative recipient kidney transplants were performed at seven U.S. centers, and recipients received an 8‑week course of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir starting 2–5 days after transplantation. The study also enrolled additional patients to compare the probability of undergoing kidney transplantation between MYTHIC participants who opted in to receive HCV-viremic kidneys and matched waitlisted comparators from the UNOS registry who did not. The main hypotheses were that accepting HCV-viremic kidneys would increase access to transplantation without compromising 1‑year outcomes, and that early DAA treatment would result in universal HCV cure with good graft function and acceptable rates of infectious and immunologic complications.",True,0.87,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,The study objective is to determine if the administration of the direct acting antiviral glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 8 weeks after kidney transplantation is both safe and effective at preventing the spread of HCV infection from donor kidney with known HCV infection (all genotypes) to an HCV negative recipient as evidenced by a negative HCV viral RNA at 12 weeks post treatment.,"The Multicenter Study to Transplant Hepatitis C-Infected Kidneys (MYTHIC; NCT03781726) was a prospective, multicenter, open-label trial conducted at seven U.S. transplant centers. It was designed to assess both the virologic efficacy and the 1‑year clinical safety of transplanting kidneys from hepatitis C virus (HCV) viremic deceased donors into HCV-negative recipients (HCV donor RNA–positive/recipient–negative, abbreviated HCV D-RNA-positive/R-negative), and to quantify the impact of this strategy on access to kidney transplantation.

Eligible candidates were adults aged 21–65 years with end-stage kidney disease (on dialysis or estimated glomerular filtration rate <15 ml/min/1.73 m²), without HIV, hepatitis B virus infection, or known liver disease. Assessment for liver fibrosis was mandatory; candidates with liver stiffness >8 kPa by FibroScan were excluded. Donors had a kidney donor profile index (KDPI) ≤85% at allocation. All participants who consented to the trial were eligible to receive offers from HCV-viremic donors; 30 ultimately underwent HCV D-RNA-positive/R-negative kidney transplantation between April and October 2019. Additional enrolled patients either received kidneys from HCV antibody–positive/RNA-negative donors, underwent standard-of-care kidney transplantation, or remained on the waitlist.

HCV D-RNA-positive/R-negative recipients received induction and maintenance immunosuppression and antiviral prophylaxis per local standard of care. Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P), a fixed-dose DAA combination, was initiated 2–5 days post-transplant and continued for 8 weeks. The primary virologic endpoint was HCV cure, defined as sustained virologic response at 12 weeks after completing G/P (SVR12). The protocol included serial measurements of HCV RNA and HCV antibody, as well as routine laboratory monitoring.

For the access-to-transplant analysis, all 63 consented MYTHIC patients (regardless of whether they actually received a transplant) were compared with matched waitlisted comparators from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) registry who did not opt in to receive HCV-viremic kidneys. Potential comparators were restricted to transplant-naïve adults 21–65 years with panel-reactive antibodies <80%, no cancer history, and no consent for HCV-viremic donor kidneys. Matching incorporated race, diabetes status, blood group, obesity (BMI >35 kg/m²), dialysis status at listing, age, dialysis vintage, and center aggressiveness (standardized transplant ratio). A competing risk framework (transplant vs. death) was used to estimate 1‑year cumulative incidence of deceased donor kidney transplantation, with robust variance methods to account for matching.

Prespecified 1‑year post-transplant outcomes for the 30 HCV D-RNA-positive/R-negative recipients included: sustained virologic response and HCV RNA status up to 24 weeks post-G/P; HCV antibody dynamics; graft function (serum creatinine, estimated GFR, and proteinuria); biopsy-proven acute rejection; serious adverse events; liver biochemistry; BK polyomavirus (BKV) viremia; cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia and CMV disease; and overall and graft survival. BKV and CMV testing followed each center’s standard-of-care, and all episodes of detectable CMV were adjudicated by an expert transplant infectious disease physician as no, probable, or definite CMV disease using standard definitions.

Among 63 enrolled MYTHIC participants, 30 received HCV-viremic kidneys, 4 received HCV antibody–positive/RNA-negative kidneys, 8 received standard-of-care kidneys, and 21 remained on the waitlist. A close match in UNOS was found for 58 MYTHIC patients, yielding 2055 matched comparators. The 1‑year cumulative probability of receiving any kidney transplant (with death as a competing risk) was 68% (95% CI: 57–81%) in the MYTHIC cohort versus 19% (14–27%) in the matched UNOS comparators, and median time from consent to transplant was substantially shorter in MYTHIC (8.0 vs. 25.4 weeks).

All 30 HCV D-RNA-positive/R-negative recipients developed post-transplant HCV viremia, started G/P early postoperatively, and achieved SVR12. HCV RNA remained undetectable when measured between 32 and 52 weeks after transplantation, confirming durable virologic cure. At baseline, 28/30 recipients were HCV antibody–negative; many developed transient detectable antibody within 4 weeks post-transplant, but by 1 year only a small minority remained antibody-positive, suggesting donor-derived antibody rather than persistent recipient antibody production.

Clinical outcomes at 1 year were favorable. One-year patient survival for HCV D-RNA-positive/R-negative recipients was 93% (28/30), with both deaths occurring after successful HCV cure and not attributed to study participation (one from Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and multiorgan failure in the context of CMV infection, and one presumed cardiac death at home). All surviving HCV D-RNA-positive/R-negative recipients and all recipients of HCV antibody–positive/RNA-negative or standard-of-care kidneys had functioning grafts at 1 year. Median serum creatinine among surviving HCV D-RNA-positive/R-negative recipients was 1.17 mg/dl (IQR 1.02–1.38), with median estimated GFR of 60.0 ml/min/1.73 m² (IQR 51.4–80.8) and low urine protein-to-creatinine ratios (median 0.14, range 0.03–0.64). There were three cases of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection; no cases of de novo glomerulonephritis or HCV-related kidney injury were reported.

Liver biochemistry remained reassuring throughout follow-up: no grade 3 transaminase elevations were observed, and transient alanine aminotransferase elevations (>100 U/L) were limited to the early post-transplant period or episodes of CMV viremia. All survivors had normal liver tests at 1 year, and no clinically significant liver disease, including fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, was observed, consistent with the early initiation of DAAs.

Infectious complications were carefully characterized. BKV viremia occurred in 5 of 30 HCV D-RNA-positive/R-negative recipients (17%), with most episodes at low to moderate viral loads; immunosuppression was reduced in three cases, and no biopsy-proven BK nephropathy or significant graft dysfunction was reported. CMV viremia was detected in 10 recipients, with five patients (all CMV donor-positive/recipient-negative) experiencing viral loads >1000 IU/ml. Among 10 CMV D+/R− recipients (who received 6 months of valganciclovir prophylaxis), five developed significant viremia after prophylaxis cessation; four were adjudicated as having probable or definite CMV disease. The observed rate of definite CMV disease in this high-risk subgroup (~20%) was similar to that reported in prior valganciclovir prophylaxis trials, although the sample size was small.

Overall, the MYTHIC trial demonstrates that in carefully selected HCV-negative kidney transplant candidates without significant liver fibrosis, accepting kidneys from HCV-viremic donors and initiating G/P within the first postoperative week yields 100% HCV cure, excellent 1‑year graft function, and acceptable rates of infectious and immunologic complications. In parallel, this strategy substantially increases the probability and speed of receiving a kidney transplant compared with matched candidates who do not opt in to HCV-viremic organ offers. The authors highlight that these findings rely on early access to DAAs and rigorous candidate screening and acknowledge that broader implementation will require systems to guarantee prompt antiviral therapy and careful patient selection. Longer-term follow-up is needed to determine whether transient donor-derived HCV viremia has any late adverse consequences.",True,0.84,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
