GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,EV,EV,,"CA008-002 (NCT02341625) is an international, multicohort, open-label phase I/IIa study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of BMS-986148, a mesothelin-directed antibody–drug conjugate (ADC), administered alone or in combination with the anti–PD-1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab in patients with advanced solid tumors predicted to express mesothelin.

Rationale:
Mesothelin is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell-surface glycoprotein that is highly overexpressed in several malignancies, including malignant pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma, ovarian, pancreatic, gastric cancers, and non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), while its expression in normal tissues is largely restricted to mesothelial cells. This differential expression makes mesothelin an attractive therapeutic target for antibody-based therapies that can deliver cytotoxic payloads selectively to tumor cells. BMS-986148 is a fully human IgG1 anti-mesothelin monoclonal antibody conjugated via a valine–citrulline linker to tubulysin, a microtubule-disrupting cytotoxic agent, with an average drug-to-antibody ratio of approximately 3. Preclinical studies suggested that combining BMS-986148 with nivolumab could enhance antitumor effects by promoting immunogenic cell death, increasing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and reversing PD-1–mediated T-cell inhibition.

Study design and treatment:
The trial consists of dose-escalation, dose-exploration, and dose-expansion phases across multiple parts:
- Part 1A (monotherapy dose escalation, every 3 weeks): BMS-986148 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, or 1.6 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks (21-day cycles).
- Part 1B (monotherapy dose escalation, once-weekly schedule): BMS-986148 at 0.4 or 0.6 mg/kg intravenously once weekly for 3 weeks followed by 1 week off (28-day cycles).
- Part 2 (monotherapy dose expansion): BMS-986148 at 1.2 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in patients with tumor mesothelin expression meeting a predefined threshold.
- Part 3A (combination dose escalation): BMS-986148 0.8 mg/kg plus nivolumab 360 mg intravenously every 3 weeks.
- Part 3B (combination dose expansion): BMS-986148 0.8 mg/kg plus nivolumab 360 mg intravenously every 3 weeks in selected tumor types.

Eligible patients were adults (≥18 years) with histologically confirmed advanced (metastatic, recurrent, refractory, and/or unresectable) pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma (excluding sarcomatoid), ovarian cancer (excluding mucinous), pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, or NSCLC (adenocarcinoma). They were required to have at least one measurable lesion per RECIST v1.1 (or modified RECIST for malignant pleural mesothelioma) and an ECOG performance status of 0–1. Patients must have progressed on or been intolerant to at least one standard therapy; prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, and immunotherapy were allowed. In the monotherapy and combination dose-expansion cohorts, tumors had to show mesothelin expression at the plasma membrane with an H-score ≥100 by central immunohistochemistry.

Key exclusion criteria included active CNS metastases (or CNS disease as the only site), prior exposure to BMS-986148 or other mesothelin-directed antibodies/ADCs, certain prior malignancies, significant uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, and chronic hepatitis. The study complied with Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided informed consent for study participation and tumor biopsies.

Objectives and assessments:
The primary objectives were to characterize safety and tolerability, to define dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and to identify the recommended phase II dose of BMS-986148 alone or with nivolumab. DLTs were assessed during the first cycle (21 days for every-3-week regimens and 28 days for the once-weekly schedule). Adverse events were graded per NCI CTCAE v4.03. A modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design guided dose escalation with target DLT rates around 27–29%.

Secondary objectives included determining pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax and AUC for total antibody, active ADC, and unconjugated tubulysin) and describing preliminary antitumor activity (objective response rate, duration of response, and progression-free survival) per RECIST v1.1 or modified RECIST for pleural mesothelioma. Tumor imaging was performed at baseline and every 6 weeks for every-3-week regimens, or every 8 weeks for once-weekly regimens, then every 12 weeks during follow-up. Responses required confirmation at least 4 weeks later. Patients on combination therapy who had clinical benefit and stable performance status were allowed to continue treatment beyond initial radiographic progression at the investigator’s discretion.

Mesothelin expression analysis:
Mesothelin expression at the tumor-cell plasma membrane and cytoplasm was assessed by immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples at a central laboratory. Staining intensity (0, 1+, 2+, 3+) and percentage of positive tumor cells were scored to calculate an H-score: (3 × % cells at 3+) + (2 × % at 2+) + (1 × % at 1+). In dose escalation, mesothelin expression was evaluated retrospectively; in expansion, it was used prospectively to select patients with H-score ≥100.

Patient population and treatment exposure:
Between May 2015 and April 2019, 126 patients with advanced tumors predicted to express mesothelin were treated: 96 received BMS-986148 monotherapy (84 on every-3-week and 12 on once-weekly regimens) and 30 received BMS-986148 plus nivolumab. Median age across cohorts was approximately 62–64 years; 53% were male. Most had received prior systemic therapy, with 41% having three or more prior lines. The most common tumor types were mesothelioma and ovarian cancer. The mean treatment duration with BMS-986148 was 15.3 weeks (range, 2.4–115.4 weeks), and disease progression was the most frequent reason for discontinuation.

Dose finding and safety:
In the every-3-week monotherapy dose escalation (Part 1A), six dose levels were tested from 0.1 to 1.6 mg/kg. At 1.6 mg/kg, 5 of 10 patients experienced DLTs, mainly grade 3, prolonged (>5 days) elevations in serum transaminases and one case of grade 3 pleuritic pain. In the once-weekly schedule (Part 1B), DLTs were observed at 0.4 and 0.6 mg/kg, and the 0.6 mg/kg once-weekly regimen was considered above the MTD. The 1.2 mg/kg every-3-week dose was declared the MTD and selected as the recommended phase II dose for monotherapy expansion. In the combination escalation (Part 3A), one DLT occurred among 11 patients treated with BMS-986148 0.8 mg/kg plus nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks, and this dose was chosen for combination expansion.

Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were common, occurring in 86% of patients on monotherapy every 3 weeks, 92% on monotherapy once weekly, and 90% on combination therapy. Most TRAEs were grade 1–2. Frequently observed TRAEs included increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), as well as gastrointestinal and constitutional symptoms such as nausea, fatigue, decreased appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, dyspnea, abdominal pain, and pleuritic pain. Grade 3–4 TRAEs were observed in 49% of patients on every-3-week monotherapy, 25% on once-weekly monotherapy, and 33% on combination therapy.

Hepatic TRAEs (elevations in AST, ALT, ALP, and other liver-function abnormalities) were among the most prominent toxicities and were dose limiting at higher BMS-986148 dose levels. Three patients had grade 4 treatment-related liver abnormalities (e.g., ALT increase, gamma-glutamyltransferase increase, jaundice). The frequency and severity of liver-related events increased with dose, but most resolved with dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation. The pattern of liver injury is consistent with the known toxicity of tubulysin and could involve both antigen-dependent and antigen-independent mechanisms, such as effects on Kupffer cells and other hepatic cell types.

Serious TRAEs occurred in 18% of every-3-week monotherapy patients, 17% of once-weekly monotherapy patients, and 23% of combination patients. Serious events included abdominal pain, anemia, diarrhea, drug-induced liver injury, hepatitis (including immune-mediated), jaundice, noncardiac chest pain, pericarditis, pleurisy, pneumonitis, pericardial effusion, and pleuritic pain. One treatment-related death due to pneumonitis occurred in a patient with ovarian cancer receiving 1.2 mg/kg every 3 weeks; imaging showed bilateral reticular infiltrates without evidence of infection or cardiac pathology, and the event was judged not attributable to disease progression.

Ophthalmic adverse events, a concern with many ADCs, were reported in fewer than 10% of patients and were mostly low grade and manageable with topical therapies or cataract surgery. Two patients at 1.2 mg/kg every 3 weeks had grade 3 ocular events (keratopathy with reduced visual acuity, and bilateral cataracts). Proactive eye monitoring and ophthalmology consultation were built into the protocol due to preclinical evidence suggesting potential mesothelin-mediated ocular toxicity; however, the incidence and severity were lower than reported with some other ADCs using different payloads.

Pharmacokinetics:
Total antibody and active ADC exposures increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner across the tested dose range and schedules. Clearance of the total antibody and active ADC was linear, with a volume of distribution approximating serum volume (2–3 L), indicating limited tissue distribution beyond the vascular and interstitial compartments. No relevant accumulation of active ADC was observed over multiple cycles at doses between 0.4 and 1.6 mg/kg. Unconjugated tubulysin was detectable at doses ≥0.4 mg/kg, appearing within 24 hours after infusion and showing low but sustained concentrations (approximately 0.1–0.9 ng/mL) over the dosing interval. Exposure to unconjugated tubulysin at 0.8 mg/kg in combination with nivolumab was similar to that seen with BMS-986148 monotherapy at the same dose.

Efficacy and clinical activity:
Preliminary antitumor activity was observed in both monotherapy and combination cohorts. Among 51 patients in the monotherapy expansion (1.2 mg/kg every 3 weeks), three patients (6%) achieved confirmed partial responses (one with malignant mesothelioma and two with ovarian cancer), with durations of response ranging from approximately 3 to 20 months. Across all monotherapy cohorts, disease control (CR, PR, or stable disease) was observed in 56% of mesothelioma and 59% of ovarian cancer patients.

In the combination cohorts (BMS-986148 0.8 mg/kg plus nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks), 6 of 30 patients (20%) achieved confirmed partial responses: four with pleural mesothelioma, one with nonpleural mesothelioma, and one with pancreatic cancer. Duration of response in these responders ranged from about 5 to more than 10 months. The disease control rate in mesothelioma patients treated with the combination was 85%, and median progression-free survival in this group was reported as 6.5 months, which compares favorably with historically reported progression-free survival for PD-1 inhibitors alone in mesothelioma.

Correlation with mesothelin expression:
Baseline mesothelin expression at the plasma membrane, measured by H-score, was analyzed by tumor type and response status, particularly in mesothelioma and ovarian cancer. Median H-scores were high in both mesothelioma and ovarian cohorts (approximately 195 and 192, respectively). However, within the limitations of small numbers of responders, no clear association between the level of mesothelin expression and clinical response to BMS-986148, whether as monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab, was observed.

Conclusions:
This phase I/IIa study demonstrated that BMS-986148, a mesothelin-directed ADC, has a clinically manageable safety profile when given alone or with nivolumab in patients with heavily pretreated advanced mesothelin-expressing solid tumors. The primary toxicities were hepatic and largely reversible with appropriate dose modifications, with relatively low rates of severe ocular toxicity compared with some other ADCs. Pharmacokinetic analyses showed predictable, dose-proportional exposure and low systemic levels of unconjugated tubulysin.

The study provided early evidence of durable antitumor activity in subsets of patients with mesothelioma, ovarian cancer, and pancreatic cancer. Response rates appeared higher and progression-free survival longer in mesothelioma patients treated with the combination of BMS-986148 and nivolumab than would be expected from historical data with PD-1 blockade alone, although the study lacked a randomized comparator arm. No clear exposure–response relationship with mesothelin expression was demonstrated, and larger studies would be needed to clarify biomarker-based patient selection.

Overall, the data support further evaluation of BMS-986148 and similar mesothelin-targeted ADCs, particularly in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, as part of multimodal treatment strategies for advanced mesothelioma and other mesothelin-expressing solid tumors.",,,,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,True,False,True,False,False,False
