Suboptimal response was defined by recent clinical relapses and/or MRI activity (contrast‑enhancing lesions or new/enlarging T2 lesions) while on a stable DMT for at least 6 months.

GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,EV,EV,,"CASTING (NCT02861014) was a European‑based, phase 3b, prospective, international, multicenter, interventional, single‑arm, open‑label study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab in patients with relapsing‑remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) who had an inadequate response to previous disease‑modifying therapy (DMT).

Eligible patients were 18–55 years old, met McDonald 2010 criteria for RRMS, had an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 0.0 and 4.0, and had relatively early disease (disease duration <10 years from first symptom, or ≤5 years from diagnosis if date of first symptom was unknown). All participants had a documented suboptimal response to one or two prior DMTs. Suboptimal response was defined as at least one clinical relapse, or at least one T1‑weighted gadolinium‑enhancing lesion, or at least two new or enlarging T2‑weighted hyperintense lesions on MRI while receiving a stable dose of a DMT for at least 6 months; for patients on the same DMT for more than 1 year, these events had to occur within the last 12 months. Patients could be enrolled based solely on MRI activity, clinical relapse, or both. Patients previously treated with natalizumab were generally excluded (except if discontinued because of persistent anti‑natalizumab antibodies) to avoid risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

Following screening (up to 4 weeks), all eligible patients received ocrelizumab 600 mg intravenously every 24 weeks for 96 weeks (four treatment cycles; last dose at Week 72). The first 600 mg dose was administered as two 300 mg infusions separated by 14 days. EDSS assessments, relapse evaluations, and brain MRI scans were performed at baseline and at Weeks 24, 48, and 96; an additional MRI at Week 8 was used for MRI re‑baselining.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) over the 96‑week treatment period, using MRI re‑baselining at Week 8. NEDA was defined as absence of: (i) protocol‑defined relapse (PDR; new or worsening neurological symptoms attributed to MS), (ii) 24‑week confirmed disability progression (CDP; increase in EDSS by ≥1.0 point from baseline), (iii) T1‑weighted gadolinium‑enhancing contrast‑enhancing lesions (CELs), and (iv) new and/or enlarging T2‑weighted hyperintense lesions. Patients who discontinued early for lack of efficacy or death were imputed as having a disease‑activity event.

Key secondary endpoints included: NEDA during the first 24‑week and 48‑week intervals; time to first event of any NEDA component; time to first PDR; time to first CDP; time to first new/enlarging T2 lesion; mean change in EDSS from baseline to Week 96; proportions of patients with CDP, stable disability, or confirmed disability improvement (CDI; EDSS decrease ≥1.0 in those with baseline EDSS ≥2); annualized relapse rate (ARR) at Week 96; total number and adjusted rates of CELs and new/enlarging T2 lesions; changes in T2 lesion volume; and percentage changes in whole‑brain volume, white matter volume, and cortical gray matter volume from Week 8 using standardized MRI analysis methods (SIENA/X and paired Jacobian integration). Subgroup analyses were prespecified for demographics (age), disease characteristics (baseline EDSS, relapse history, timing of qualifying event), enrollment reason (MRI only, relapse only, both), and prior/last DMT type (interferon‑based therapies, glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, natalizumab). Exploratory endpoints included NEDA without re‑baselining (MRI from screening), epoch‑specific NEDA (Year 1 vs Year 2), and predictors of NEDA using logistic regression.

The study enrolled 680 treated patients across 157 centers. Most (60.4%) had received one prior DMT and 39.6% two DMTs. About one quarter (24.6%) were enrolled based on MRI activity alone, while others were enrolled for relapse alone or relapse plus MRI activity. Interferon‑based regimens were the most common prior DMT. The mean time from last DMT to first ocrelizumab dose was about 1.9 months.

In the modified intention‑to‑treat population, 74.8% (492/658; 95% CI 71.3–78.0) of patients achieved NEDA at Week 96 when MRI was re‑baselined at Week 8. Clinical NEDA (no relapse, no CDP) was seen in 80.4%, and MRI NEDA (no CELs and no new/enlarging T2 lesions) in 91.5%. NEDA rates were similar in the per‑protocol population. NEDA during the first 24 and 48 weeks was also high (87.1% and 82.6%, respectively). More patients had NEDA in Year 2 than Year 1.

Subgroup analyses showed the highest NEDA rate in patients enrolled for MRI activity only, in those with baseline EDSS <2.5, with ≤1 relapse prior to enrollment, and in patients with the qualifying event ≥6 months before study entry. NEDA rates did not differ meaningfully by age or by baseline CEL status. Patients with only one prior DMT had higher NEDA rates than those with two prior DMTs, and NEDA was highest when interferon‑based regimens were the last prior treatment and lowest when fingolimod was the last prior DMT. Only sex (female vs male) emerged as a significant prognostic factor in multivariable analysis, with women somewhat less likely to achieve NEDA.

Clinical outcomes were consistent with the primary endpoint. At Week 96, Kaplan–Meier estimated event‑free rates were 76.3% for any disease‑activity event, 88.4% for 24‑week CDP, and 90.0% for first relapse. Among patients with baseline EDSS ≥2, 16.5% experienced 24‑week CDI. Mean EDSS remained essentially stable from baseline to Week 96, and 86.6% of evaluable patients had stable or improved EDSS (change between −0.5 and +0.5 or improvement). The adjusted ARR at Week 96 was 0.030, corresponding to approximately one relapse every 33 years on average.

MRI data showed near‑complete suppression of inflammatory lesion activity from Week 8 onward. Very few CELs and new/enlarging T2 lesions were detected at Weeks 24, 48, and 96, and adjusted lesion rates were very low and decreased over time. Total T2 lesion volume decreased by about 8.5% on average from Week 8 to Week 96. Normalized whole‑brain volume, white matter volume, and cortical gray matter volume decreased modestly over the treatment period, with rates of brain volume loss in the range typical of healthy aging.

Safety analyses showed that ocrelizumab was generally well tolerated and no new safety signals were identified compared with previous trials. Overall, 89.1% of patients experienced at least one adverse event (AE); most were mild to moderate (Grade 1–2). Infusion‑related reactions (IRRs), nasopharyngitis, headache, influenza, and urinary tract infection were the most frequent AEs. IRRs occurred in 43.2% of patients, were mostly Grade 1–2, and were most common with the first infusion. Serious AEs occurred in 7.2% of patients, with serious infections in 1.6%. Neoplasms were rare, with a small number of basal cell carcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, and benign thymic neoplasm cases. AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were infrequent (1.0%). One death (suicide) occurred. No notable safety issues were observed in laboratory parameters, physical or neurological examinations, vital signs, or non‑MS MRI findings.

In summary, CASTING demonstrates that in RRMS patients with suboptimal responses to one or two prior DMTs, switching to ocrelizumab results in high rates of no evidence of disease activity over 2 years, stable or improved disability, strong suppression of MRI disease activity, and acceptable safety. The results support early switching to a high‑efficacy B‑cell‑depleting therapy such as ocrelizumab in patients with breakthrough disease activity on other DMTs, and suggest that earlier use (first switch) and less advanced disease are associated with better NEDA outcomes.",,,,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,True,False,True,False,False,False
