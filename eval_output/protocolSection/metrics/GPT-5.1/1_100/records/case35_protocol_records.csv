GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,TP,TP,"The study will compare the efficacy and safety of treatment with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) versus paclitaxel in Asian, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive participants with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have progressed after failure of any combination chemotherapy containing a platinum and a fluoropyrimidine agent.

The primary study hypotheses are that pembrolizumab prolongs Overall Survival (OS) compared to paclitaxel and that pembrolizumab prolongs Progression-free Survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) assessed by blinded central radiologists' review compared to paclitaxel.","KEYNOTE-063 (NCT03019588) was a randomized, open-label, phase 3 clinical trial conducted at 36 centers in China, Malaysia, South Korea, and Taiwan. It compared pembrolizumab with paclitaxel as second-line treatment in adult Asian patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (combined positive score ≥1) and had progressed after first-line platinum/fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy. Patients were randomized 1:1 to pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for up to 2 years or weekly paclitaxel. The primary goals were to evaluate overall survival and progression-free survival; secondary objectives included objective response rate and safety. Enrollment was stopped early after results from the global KEYNOTE-061 trial showed no significant overall survival benefit for pembrolizumab over paclitaxel. In this smaller Asian cohort, overall survival was similar between groups, progression-free survival favored paclitaxel, and pembrolizumab showed fewer treatment-related adverse events, indicating a favorable tolerability profile but inconclusive efficacy due to limited statistical power.",True,0.95,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,FP,"Once the participant has achieved the study objective or the study has ended, the participant will be discontinued from the study and may be enrolled in an extension study to continue protocol-defined assessments and treatment. Enrollment in the extension study will be conditional on participant consent. Treatment with pembrolizumab or paclitaxel will continue until documented disease progression, unacceptable adverse event(s), intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, investigator's decision to discontinue the participant, participant withdraws consent, pregnancy of the participant, participant receives 35 administrations (approximately 2 years) of pembrolizumab, or administrative reasons requiring cessation of treatment.","KEYNOTE-063 (NCT03019588) was a randomized, open-label, phase 3 study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab versus paclitaxel as second-line therapy in Asian patients with advanced PD-L1–positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. The trial was conducted at 36 medical centers across China (mainland), Malaysia, South Korea, and Taiwan.

Eligible participants were adults (≥18 years) with histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma, measurable disease per RECIST v1.1, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 0 or 1, and tumor PD-L1 expression with a combined positive score (CPS) ≥1 assessed centrally using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay. Patients had to have documented disease progression during or after first-line treatment with any platinum/fluoropyrimidine doublet. Those with HER2-positive tumors were required to have progressed on trastuzumab-containing therapy; HER2 status could be determined locally when unknown.

Patients were randomized 1:1, stratified by time to progression on first-line therapy (<6 vs ≥6 months) and ECOG PS (0 vs 1), to one of two treatment arms: pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles (approximately 2 years) or paclitaxel 80 mg/m² intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 4-week cycle. Treatment was continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, investigator decision, or withdrawal of consent. Tumor imaging was performed every 6 weeks and assessed by blinded independent central review according to RECIST v1.1.

The dual primary endpoints were overall survival (OS), defined as time from randomization to death from any cause, and progression-free survival (PFS), defined as time from randomization to radiographic disease progression or death. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1, duration of response (DOR; exploratory), and safety/tolerability. Efficacy was analyzed in the intention-to-treat population; safety was evaluated in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. Time-to-event outcomes were estimated using Kaplan–Meier methods, and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained from stratified Cox proportional hazards models.

The original sample size was 360 patients, which was expected to provide approximately 91% power to detect superiority of pembrolizumab over paclitaxel for OS at a one-sided alpha of 0.0215, assuming an underlying OS hazard ratio of 0.67 and 290 OS events. However, after the global phase 3 KEYNOTE-061 trial demonstrated that pembrolizumab did not significantly improve OS compared with paclitaxel as second-line therapy in a broader population with PD-L1 CPS ≥1 gastric/GEJ cancer, screening and enrollment in KEYNOTE-063 were halted on March 12, 2018. As a result, only 94 patients were enrolled (47 per arm), and the study was underpowered for its planned efficacy comparisons.

With a median follow-up of 24 months from randomization to data cutoff (October 8, 2019), 83 of 94 patients had died. Median OS was 8 months (95% CI, 4–10) in the pembrolizumab group and 8 months (95% CI, 5–11) in the paclitaxel group (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.63–1.54), indicating no apparent difference in survival. Median PFS was 2 months (95% CI, 1–3) for pembrolizumab and 4 months (95% CI, 3–6) for paclitaxel (HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.04–2.52), favoring paclitaxel. Confirmed ORR was 13% with pembrolizumab and 19% with paclitaxel; complete responses occurred in 4% and 6% of patients, respectively. Median DOR was 8 months (range, 3–20+ months) in the pembrolizumab arm and 12 months (range, 2–17+ months) in the paclitaxel arm, with four patients in each group achieving responses lasting at least 6 months.

Safety findings showed a more favorable toxicity profile for pembrolizumab compared with paclitaxel. Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) of any grade occurred in 60% of pembrolizumab-treated patients versus 96% of paclitaxel-treated patients. Grade 3–5 treatment-related AEs were reported in 11% versus 64% of patients, respectively. Common treatment-related AEs with pembrolizumab included fatigue and hypothyroidism, whereas paclitaxel was associated with typical cytotoxic toxicities such as alopecia, neutropenia, leukopenia, decreased appetite, anemia, fatigue, nausea, transaminase elevations, and peripheral neuropathy. Treatment-related AEs led to treatment discontinuation in 2% of pembrolizumab-treated patients and 14% of paclitaxel-treated patients. Treatment-related deaths occurred only in the paclitaxel arm (5%), due to pneumonia. Immune-mediated AEs and infusion reactions were observed in 19% of pembrolizumab-treated patients, mainly thyroid dysfunction, pneumonitis, adrenal insufficiency, and hypersensitivity, consistent with known immune checkpoint inhibitor toxicity profiles.

The investigators noted that baseline characteristics in KEYNOTE-063 were generally similar to those of the PD-L1 CPS ≥1 population in the global KEYNOTE-061 trial but with some differences in functional status, tumor site, histology, and previous surgery in this Asian cohort. They concluded that, due to early termination and limited sample size, definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy of second-line pembrolizumab in Asian patients with advanced PD-L1–positive gastric/GEJ cancer cannot be drawn. Nonetheless, pembrolizumab was well tolerated and showed a safety profile consistent with prior studies. Overall, the patterns of efficacy and safety in KEYNOTE-063 were similar to those observed in the larger global KEYNOTE-061 trial. The authors emphasized the continued need to define the optimal role and timing of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment continuum for advanced gastric/GEJ cancer, particularly as these agents move into first-line combination regimens.",False,0.38,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
