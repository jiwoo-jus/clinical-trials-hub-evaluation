One trial enrolled HIV‑positive pregnant women and the other enrolled HIV‑negative pregnant women. In both trials, all women received assisted partner notification services. Women in the intervention groups additionally received targeted education on oral HIV self‑testing and up to five HIV self‑test kits to give to their partners. The primary outcome was whether the woman’s primary male partner tested for HIV at a health facility within 30 days. A secondary prespecified outcome was male partner HIV testing of any kind (including self‑testing at home) within 30 days. The hypothesis was that combining partner notification with secondary distribution of HIV self‑test kits would increase male partner HIV testing, particularly facility‑based testing that could facilitate linkage to HIV prevention and treatment services.",True,0.94,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"Pregnant women 18 years of age or older who enter antenatal care at Chipata Level 1 Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia will participate.

HIV-positive and HIV-negative pregnant women will be randomized to one of two groups: partner notification alone or partner notification plus secondary distribution of HIV self-test kits. Women will return to the clinic 30 days after enrollment for an exit visit during which time information about their experience with the partner notification strategies will be collected.

A random sample of women and health care workers will also participate in qualitative interviews.","This research comprised two parallel, individual‑level, unmasked randomized controlled trials conducted at Chipata Level 1 Hospital, a public facility in Lusaka, Zambia, where antenatal HIV prevalence is approximately 16%. The trials evaluated a combination approach to increase HIV testing among male partners of pregnant women, comparing partner notification services alone versus partner notification plus secondary distribution of HIV self‑test kits.

Trial 1 enrolled pregnant women aged 18 years or older with documented HIV‑positive test results in their antenatal record. Trial 2 enrolled pregnant women aged 18 years or older with documented HIV‑negative test results obtained within the previous 3 months of the current pregnancy. Eligible women had at least one current male sexual partner, were willing and able to consent, provide contact information, and adhere to study procedures. Women who had already undergone couples HIV testing with their partner during the current pregnancy or who reported concerns about intimate partner violence (IPV) or social harms at screening were excluded. HIV‑positive and HIV‑negative women were enrolled into separate trials.

Participants in both trials were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to a control group or an intervention group using permuted block randomization with varying block sizes (2, 4, and 6). Allocation was implemented via sealed, opaque, sequentially numbered envelopes. The study was unmasked: participants and staff knew the group assignments.

In both trials, all participants received assisted partner notification services, consistent with WHO recommendations and Zambian guidelines. Women were offered four options for encouraging male partner HIV testing: (1) client self‑referral (the woman discloses her status and encourages the partner to seek testing), (2) provider contract referral (the woman agrees to notify the partner within a set period, after which providers may contact the partner if testing has not occurred), (3) provider referral (with the woman’s consent, a provider directly contacts the partner to offer testing), and (4) dual referral (a provider accompanies the woman for joint disclosure and offers testing). HIV‑negative women received an adapted, status‑neutral version of these services focused on HIV prevention rather than treatment. Nearly all women selected client self‑referral.

In the intervention arms of both trials, women additionally received targeted education on the use of oral fluid HIV self‑test kits (OraQuick) for their partners (and themselves if desired). Written multilingual instructions (English, Bemba, Nyanja) were provided, using materials approved by the Zambia Ministry of Health. Up to five oral HIV self‑test kits were supplied per participant for secondary distribution to male partners. All participants, irrespective of group, were advised that HIV testing at a health facility by trained health‑care providers was recommended, including confirmatory facility‑based testing following any self‑test result.

Women were scheduled for a follow‑up visit approximately 30 days after enrolment. At this visit, they reported whether their primary male partner had undergone HIV testing in the previous 30 days, including date, test modality, and venue (facility‑based or elsewhere, e.g., home self‑testing). The primary outcome was the proportion of primary male partners reported to have been tested for HIV at a health facility within 30 days after randomization. A prespecified additional outcome (added before study completion) was the proportion of primary male partners reported to have undergone HIV testing of any kind within 30 days, including self‑testing at home or testing at community‑based venues. Partner HIV test results (positive, negative, indeterminate), reported linkage to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and any serious adverse events were also recorded.

Safety assessments included screening for intimate partner violence and social harms potentially related to study participation. A nine‑item IPV questionnaire adapted from the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey and social harm questions adapted from prior Malawian studies were administered at follow‑up. Any affirmative response was considered an incident IPV or social harm event. Participants reporting IPV or social harms were counselled and referred to a gender‑based violence command center on‑site when appropriate.

Statistical analyses used a complete‑case approach with the woman as the unit of analysis, conducted separately for the two trials. The primary analysis compared the proportion of women reporting facility‑based partner HIV testing within 30 days between intervention and control groups using an estimated probability difference (risk difference) with Wald‑based 95% confidence intervals. The same method was used for the outcome of partner HIV testing of any kind. Prespecified sensitivity analyses employed an augmented inverse probability weighted doubly robust approach adjusting for partner age, age difference, travel time to facility, and partner HIV testing history, with bootstrapped confidence intervals. Additional sensitivity analyses included best‑case/worst‑case bounds for missing data and multiple imputation using fully conditional specification. A pooled analysis weighted by site antenatal HIV prevalence (16%) was done to provide population‑level estimates, and time‑to‑event analyses using Kaplan–Meier curves described days from randomization to reported partner HIV testing, with right‑censoring at 30 days.

Recruitment took place from Oct 28, 2019, to May 26, 2020. Of 426 pregnant women approached, 97 (23%) who had already tested with their partner during the current pregnancy were excluded. Of 329 screened for full eligibility, three HIV‑negative women under age 18 were excluded. Ultimately, 116 HIV‑positive women were enrolled in trial 1 (58 intervention, 58 control) and 210 HIV‑negative women in trial 2 (105 intervention, 105 control). Retention at 30 days was 86% (100/116) in trial 1 and 95% (200/210) in trial 2.

In both trials, the intervention significantly reduced reported facility‑based male partner HIV testing within 30 days but increased overall male partner HIV testing of any kind, driven by self‑testing. Among HIV‑positive women (trial 1), 6% (3/47) of partners in the intervention group versus 28% (15/53) in the control group underwent facility‑based testing (probability difference −21.9 percentage points, 95% CI −35.9 to −7.9). Among HIV‑negative women (trial 2), 3% (3/102) of partners in the intervention group versus 34% (33/98) in the control group had facility‑based testing (probability difference −30.7 percentage points, 95% CI −40.6 to −20.8). In pooled standardized analyses, the estimated probability difference for facility‑based testing was −29.3 percentage points (95% CI −37.9 to −20.7).

Conversely, when HIV testing of any kind was considered, the intervention improved overall partner testing rates. In trial 1, 77% (36/47) of women in the intervention group versus 36% (19/53) in the control group reported any partner HIV testing (probability difference 40.7 percentage points, 95% CI 23.0 to 58.4). In trial 2, the corresponding figures were 78% (80/102) versus 55% (54/98), respectively (probability difference 23.3 percentage points, 95% CI 10.7 to 36.0). In pooled standardized analysis, the probability difference for any testing was 26.1 percentage points (95% CI 15.1 to 37.1).

Across both trials, 14 male partners were reported to have tested HIV‑positive. In trial 1, 13 of 55 tested partners of HIV‑positive women were HIV‑positive and eight were reported to be on ART. Many partners of HIV‑positive women were reported to be HIV‑negative, indicating a high prevalence of HIV‑serodiscordant couples. In trial 2 (HIV‑negative women), most tested partners were reported HIV‑negative; one partner had an indeterminate result and one tested HIV‑positive and initiated ART.

Adverse social outcomes were uncommon. Three cases of intimate partner violence were reported in total: two in control groups and one in an intervention group. One control‑group HIV‑positive woman reported IPV, abandonment, and emotional and legal harms linked to study participation. Two additional IPV events (one intervention, one control) were reported but not attributed to study procedures. No IPV or social harms were reported among HIV‑negative women. One maternal death occurred in an HIV‑positive woman in the intervention group due to meningoencephalitis from advanced HIV disease, considered unrelated to the study.

The study demonstrates that combining assisted partner notification with secondary distribution of HIV self‑test kits substantially increases overall male partner HIV testing among both HIV‑positive and HIV‑negative pregnant women but simultaneously reduces the proportion of men who present for facility‑based testing, potentially limiting opportunities for counselling, confirmatory diagnosis, HIV treatment initiation, and HIV prevention interventions such as pre‑exposure prophylaxis. The findings highlight a need to strengthen linkages between community‑based and self‑testing approaches and formal health services so that men who test (particularly those living with HIV or at high risk) are effectively connected to comprehensive HIV care and prevention. The trials also underscore the feasibility of a status‑neutral, couples‑based framework for engaging male partners in antenatal HIV services while maintaining a low observed incidence of IPV and social harms among screened participants.",True,0.74,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
