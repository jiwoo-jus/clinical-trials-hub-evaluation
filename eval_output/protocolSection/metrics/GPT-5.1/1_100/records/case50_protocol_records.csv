Forty‑seven healthy adults were experimentally infected with fully virulent Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor Inaba strain N16961 in an inpatient controlled human infection model. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 500 mg iOWH032 or matching placebo by mouth every 8 hours for 3 days, starting at onset of diarrhea or 48 hours after challenge, whichever came first. All participants subsequently received ciprofloxacin beginning day 4 post‑challenge or earlier if they met criteria for severe diarrhea. The primary objective was to assess whether iOWH032 reduced diarrheal stool output rate compared with placebo; secondary objectives included effects on diarrhea severity, duration, and other clinical and microbiological outcomes, as well as safety and pharmacokinetics. iOWH032 was generally safe and achieved plasma levels above its in vitro CFTR IC50, but did not significantly reduce diarrheal stool output, diarrhea severity, or other clinical endpoints versus placebo, and therefore was not considered suitable for further development as a cholera treatment.",True,0.88,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"The study consists of a screening phase, an inpatient containment period with challenge with Vibrio cholerae on Day 1 followed by treatment with iOWH032 or placebo and a post-challenge observation period until discharge, an outpatient follow-up period of at least 28 days, and a final follow-up (by telephone) 6 months post-challenge (Day 180) for the collection of serious adverse events.

Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either iOWH032 500 mg every 8 hours for three days or matching placebo. Blinded therapeutic dosing will start at the onset of diarrhea or by 48 hours after ingesting the challenge inoculum of V. cholerae. The observation and management of cholera diarrhea and symptomatology will occur on an inpatient isolation research ward over a duration of approximately 11 days, including a three-day course of antibiotics to treat all participants prior to discharge from the inpatient unit.","This was a randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, parallel‑group, group‑sequential Phase 2a study designed to test the clinical efficacy and safety of iOWH032, an oral cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel inhibitor, in a cholera controlled human infection model (CHIM). Cholera is an acute secretory diarrheal disease caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae, in which cholera toxin activates cAMP signaling and stimulates CFTR‑mediated chloride and water secretion into the intestinal lumen, leading to severe watery diarrhea. iOWH032, a synthetic small molecule with an oxadiazole‑carboxamide core and dibromo‑hydroxyphenyl pharmacophore, was developed as a host‑directed antisecretory therapeutic to reduce fluid loss in cholera and other CFTR‑mediated secretory diarrheas.

The trial was conducted at a single inpatient clinical research unit in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. Healthy adults aged 18–44 years without prior recent cholera infection or vaccination were enrolled. Participants were experimentally challenged with 10^6 colony‑forming units of wild‑type V. cholerae O1 El Tor Inaba strain N16961, administered orally in sodium bicarbonate solution after a brief fast. This dose and challenge model have been previously used to evaluate cholera vaccines and reliably induce acute watery diarrhea within 18–48 hours in susceptible individuals.

The study was conducted in two sequential cohorts with an interim analysis for safety and preliminary efficacy after completion of the first cohort. Randomization was 1:1 to iOWH032 or matching placebo, stratified by blood type O versus non‑O because of known increased susceptibility and severity in blood group O. Study treatment began at the onset of diarrhea (first loose stool of prespecified grade) or at 48 hours after challenge, whichever occurred first. Participants received 500 mg iOWH032 (two 250 mg immediate‑release tablets) or two matching placebo tablets orally approximately every 8 hours for 3 consecutive days (nine total doses). Ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily for 3 days was instituted at 4 days post‑challenge, earlier if participants met criteria for severe cholera (>5 L cumulative diarrheal stool), or per investigator discretion; asymptomatic participants received ciprofloxacin 1–2 hours after the last iOWH032/placebo dose. All participants were managed with standard oral rehydration solution and/or intravenous fluids based on clinical need.

The primary efficacy endpoint was diarrheal stool output rate, defined as total volume of diarrheal stools (predefined as grade 3 or higher consistency) divided by the number of hours between initiation of study drug dosing and initiation of antimicrobial therapy. The principal analysis used a modified intent‑to‑treat (mITT) population including challenged participants who received at least one dose of study drug and developed diarrhea (grade ≥3) within 48 hours of challenge. Randomization was stratified by blood type, and the primary analysis used the Van Elteren test (a stratified Wilcoxon rank‑sum test) to compare treatment groups. A group‑sequential design with pre‑specified efficacy and futility boundaries at interim analysis controlled the overall one‑sided type I error at 0.025 and targeted ≥90% power to detect an approximately 50% reduction in stool output rate, based on preclinical data from mouse closed‑loop and rat models and assumptions of uniform diarrhea volume distributions.

Key secondary endpoints included: proportion of participants with moderate (3–5 L) or severe (>5 L) diarrhea; total diarrheal stool volume and area under the curve; time to first formed stool; number of loose stools; occurrence of fever and vomiting; need for oral rehydration solution and/or intravenous fluids; and microbiological endpoints such as time to cessation of detectable V. cholerae in stool, area under the curve and peak levels of bacterial shedding. Safety assessments comprised treatment‑emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), vital signs, laboratory tests, and electrocardiograms. Pharmacokinetic sampling for iOWH032 was performed 7±1 hours after the first and ninth doses to obtain troughish plasma concentrations.

Among 47 challenged participants, 36 met mITT criteria (16 iOWH032, 20 placebo); others either had no loose stools or diarrhea onset after 48 hours. In the mITT population, the median (95% CI) diarrheal stool output rate was 25.4 mL/hour (8.9, 58.3) for iOWH032 versus 32.6 mL/hour (15.8, 48.2) for placebo, corresponding to a 23% reduction that was not statistically significant (Van Elteren p = 0.2254). By blood group, median output rates were similar between iOWH032 and placebo in type O participants, whereas non‑O participants showed a numerically lower median in the iOWH032 group, but the study was not powered to evaluate these subgroup differences. When participants with symptom onset after 48 hours were included, the estimated reduction in stool output rate fell to about 13% and remained non‑significant.

For the secondary endpoint of diarrhea severity, 43.8% of iOWH032 recipients and 55% of placebo recipients in the mITT population developed moderate or severe diarrhea (>3 L output), and there was no statistically significant difference between groups (Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel p = 0.5145). There were also no significant differences in the proportion with severe diarrhea (>5 L), in median area under the curve of diarrheal stool volume, time to first formed stool, number of loose stools, occurrence of fever or vomiting, or use of oral rehydration or intravenous fluids. One iOWH032‑treated subject and four placebo‑treated subjects received intravenous fluids.

Microbiologically, the median time to cessation of detectable V. cholerae in stool was initially statistically longer in the iOWH032 group, but this apparent difference was driven by a higher proportion of early antibiotic initiation in the placebo group; after excluding those who received early antibiotics, the difference was small and not significant. There were no meaningful differences between groups in bacterial shedding AUC or peak shedding. iOWH032 plasma concentrations exceeded the in vitro CFTR IC50 (~2,725 ng/mL) after repeated dosing: mean concentrations were approximately 2,250 ng/mL 7 hours after the first dose and 4,270 ng/mL 7 hours after dose 9, indicating accumulation over the 3‑day regimen. Only a weak negative correlation was observed between plasma levels and stool output rate.

iOWH032 was generally safe and well tolerated. Study drug–related TEAEs were infrequent and mostly mild gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, abdominal discomfort, vomiting). Overall TEAEs, including those related to cholera challenge, were common but similar between groups. No participant discontinued study drug due to adverse events, and there were no deaths. One SAE (pyelonephritis) occurred in a placebo‑treated participant during follow‑up and was deemed unrelated to study treatment.

Despite adequate systemic exposure and a favorable safety profile, iOWH032 did not demonstrate clinically or statistically significant reductions in stool volume, diarrhea severity, or other key clinical endpoints in this cholera CHIM. Potential explanations discussed by the investigators include inadequate luminal drug concentrations at the intestinal CFTR target due to poor aqueous solubility, rapid intestinal transit and convective washout during acute secretory diarrhea, and limitations on dosing frequency imposed by the target product profile. The study also highlighted methodological considerations for future therapeutic CHIMs, including timing of treatment initiation relative to symptom onset, feasible sample sizes, and the magnitude of effect considered clinically meaningful.

The investigators concluded that iOWH032 does not warrant further development as a cholera treatment, although they noted the compound may have potential in other CFTR‑related disease settings. This trial represents the first use of a cholera controlled human infection model to evaluate a therapeutic candidate rather than a vaccine and provides a framework and lessons learned for future development and proof‑of‑concept testing of host‑directed antisecretory agents in infectious diarrhea.
