Participants were randomized to cabergoline 0.5 mg twice weekly plus daily placebo or NETA 5 mg daily plus twice‑weekly placebo. The main goal was to see whether cabergoline, a dopamine D2 receptor agonist that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling and angiogenesis, could reduce pelvic pain and improve function at least as well as NETA, while maintaining an acceptable safety profile. Pain intensity, pain-related interference with daily activities, emotional functioning, global impression of change, and biomarkers of angiogenesis and inflammation were measured over 6 months. In this small sample, cabergoline was well tolerated and associated with decreases in pain scores and reductions in VEGF receptor 1, suggesting it may be a promising nonhormonal option for endometriosis-related pain.",True,0.86,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,EV,EV,,"This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6‑month pilot trial conducted at Boston Children’s Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital between 2016 and 2018. The trial enrolled premenopausal women aged 15–40 years with laparoscopically and surgically confirmed American Society for Reproductive Medicine stage I–II endometriosis within the prior 2 years and clinically significant pelvic pain, defined as a visual analog scale (VAS) pain score of at least 3 out of 10 in the last month. Women using other hormonal medications, with thrombotic disease, or with contraindications to the study drugs (e.g., impaired liver function, breast cancer, cardiac valvular disorders) were excluded.

The rationale for the trial is based on the key role of angiogenesis and associated neurogenesis in the establishment and maintenance of endometriosis lesions and chronic pain. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inflammatory cytokines contribute to ectopic implantation of endometrial tissue, lesion growth, and symptom generation. Dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) agonists such as cabergoline have been shown in animal models to inhibit pathological angiogenesis by inactivating VEGF receptor 2 (VEGF‑R2) signaling without the teratogenicity and systemic toxicity associated with many commercial antiangiogenic agents. Prior preclinical work and a small human study using another DRD2 agonist (quinagolide) suggested these agents can reduce endometriosis lesion size and downregulate VEGF/VEGF‑R pathways, though pain outcomes had not been evaluated.

Participants were randomized in a double-blind fashion to one of two treatment arms: (1) oral norethindrone acetate (NETA) 5 mg daily plus placebo capsule twice weekly, or (2) oral cabergoline 0.5 mg twice weekly plus daily placebo. Medications were dispensed in identical gelatin capsules by the research pharmacy. The principal investigator, study staff, and participants were blinded to treatment allocation. The planned sample size for this pilot was 5 participants per arm to yield at least 4 completers per group; ultimately 9 women were enrolled and randomized (4 to NETA and 5 to cabergoline). Two participants (one from each arm) discontinued early, leaving 7 who completed the 6‑month protocol.

Study visits occurred at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months, with additional telehealth assessments at 6 and 18 weeks. The primary endpoint was pain, captured across four core domains recommended for chronic pain trials: physical functioning, pain intensity, emotional functioning, and global impression of improvement. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) interference scale was designated as the primary outcome. Pain intensity was assessed with a numerical VAS (0–10) for current, worst, least, and average pain over specified time frames. Emotional functioning was evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Functional impact was assessed with the Functional Disability Inventory. Overall perceived change was measured via the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale. Analgesic use (non-narcotic tablets per week) was tracked.

To explore mechanistic effects on angiogenesis and inflammation, serum biomarkers were measured at each in‑person visit, including VEGF, VEGF receptor 1 (VEGF‑R1), placental growth factor, TNF‑α, IL‑8, IL‑1β, monocyte chemotactic protein‑1, intercellular adhesion molecule‑1, vascular cell adhesion molecule‑1, and E‑selectin. A urinary marker of oxidative stress, 8‑oxo‑7,8‑dihydro-2′‑deoxyguanosine (8‑oxodG), was also collected. Safety assessments included orthostatic vital signs, body mass index, liver function tests (AST, ALT, bilirubin), lipid profiles, creatinine, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and hemoglobin A1c. Adverse events were captured using an investigator-developed symptom questionnaire focusing on common hormonal and systemic symptoms (e.g., fatigue, mood changes, breast tenderness, nausea, uterine bleeding), and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.8). Medication adherence was monitored via pill counts and pill logs.

Because of the small sample size, the study was not powered to detect statistically significant between-group differences. Analyses were descriptive, focusing on medians, interquartile ranges, and observed trends over time.

At baseline, participants in the cabergoline group reported higher current and worst pain scores and less pain relief from existing treatments than those in the NETA group. Over 6 months, women allocated to cabergoline exhibited marked reductions in worst pain intensity in the last 24 hours (median decrease from 7.0 to 1.0) and in the last month (from 8.0 to 3.0), as well as improvements in current and average pain scores and increased percentage of pain relief. The mean 6‑month decrease in worst pain (last 24 hours) was 86% in the cabergoline group versus 43% in the NETA group; average pain declined by 83% versus 57%, respectively. The NETA group showed some improvement in average pain but minimal changes in several other pain parameters. Analgesic use (number of non‑narcotic tablets per week) increased in the NETA group at 6 months, while remaining lower in the cabergoline group.

Functional disability and depressive symptoms remained generally low and stable in both groups throughout the study. At 3 months, a moderate or high degree of improvement on the PGIC scale was reported by 33% of NETA and 25% of cabergoline participants; by 6 months this increased to 66% for NETA and 50% for cabergoline.

Biomarker analyses showed divergent trends in VEGF‑R1: levels declined over 6 months in the cabergoline group (from approximately 417.6 pg/mL to 344.1 pg/mL) but rose in the NETA group (from 330.7 pg/mL to 447.6 pg/mL). Both groups had small declines in serum VEGF concentrations. Most inflammatory markers remained relatively unchanged, though IL‑8 decreased by about 50% in the cabergoline arm (from 9.5 to 4.5 pg/mL) and remained stable and low in the NETA arm.

Cabergoline was generally well tolerated. No subject developed orthostatic hypotension or tachycardia, and liver enzymes and lipid profiles stayed within normal ranges in both treatment groups. Across 40 reported symptom changes, half were mild, 43% moderate, and 7% severe. The most common symptoms were abdominal cramps or bloating, fatigue, and weight gain. Two CTCAE grade 2 adverse events were identified: significant fatigue affecting daily activities and abdominal bloating/pain limiting daily activities. There were no serious adverse events in either arm. Weight gain over 6 months averaged greater than 1.3 kg in the cabergoline group and greater than 2.5 kg in the NETA group. Changes in uterine bleeding patterns, including heavier flow, irregular bleeding, or spotting, were reported somewhat more often in the cabergoline group.

The investigators interpret these findings as preliminary evidence that cabergoline, by targeting VEGF-mediated angiogenic pathways, may offer a nonhormonal treatment option for endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain with a tolerable safety profile. Given the pilot nature and extremely small sample size, the results are hypothesis-generating and have been used to design larger, prospective randomized trials of cabergoline, particularly as an adjunct to hormonal therapy for patients with endometriosis who are resistant to or seek alternatives to standard hormonal treatments.",,,,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,True,False,True,False,False,False
