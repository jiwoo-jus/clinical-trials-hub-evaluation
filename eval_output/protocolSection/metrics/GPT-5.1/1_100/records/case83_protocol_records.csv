GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,TP,TP,"Objective:

The overall aim of this protocol is to examine the effect of pharmacological manipulations of affective and cognitive processes on anxiety and task performance. Ultimately, the goal is 1) to provide insight into the relative influence of cognitive and affective states on anxiety, 2) generate theoretical models that can be applied to a better understanding of the interaction between cognition and emotion, 3) develop a better screening approach to candidate anxiolytics, and 4) help formulate novel therapeutic interventions for clinical anxiety.

Excessive or inappropriately sustained anxiety and fear lead to the most common group of psychiatric disorders. A number of theoretical models have been proposed to understand the mechanisms engaged in these maladaptive behaviors. Most recent emphasis has focused on the synergistic contribution of cognitive and emotional processes. Our laboratory has been instrumental in delineating aspects of behavioral and neural processes that are associated with fear and anxiety, using psychophysiological and neuroimaging measures of fear and anxiety. Evidence shows that levels of anxiety modulate cognitive performance, such as working memory or perceptual discrimination, and that, conversely, cognitive engagement influences severity of experimentally induced anxiety. The exact contribution of emotional processes vs. cognitive processes to the experience of anxiety is not clear, similarly to the neural mechanisms underlying these interactions.

In this protocol, we propose to manipulate pharmacologically separately cognitive and emotional processes to dissociate their contribution to fear/anxiety, while using state-of-the-art measures of anxiety derived from translational work. Indeed, we already developed integrative experimental models of fear and anxiety via the manipulation of predictable and unpredictable shock, respectively. We already employed successfully these models to measure anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects of various compounds such as alprazolam, citalopram, hydrocortisone, and oxytocin in healthy participants.

We propose in a first step (step-1) to start with a simple proof-of-concept study, using two pharmacological compounds in a double-blind randomized parallel design, each preferentially acting respectively on the cognitive (methylphenidate) or affective (propranolol) domain, and using a single cognitive process (working memory). In a second step (step-2), we propose to extend this work to the fMRI to examine the cognitive correlates of the effects seen in the step-1 behavioral study, specifically with methylphenidate. Whereas the comparison among three drugs is planned for the electrophysiology study, we plan to study only the drug that improves cognition in the fMRI. The reason we will focus on methylphenidate in step 2 is that our overall goal is to study the effect of improving cognitive functions on anxiety using neuroimaging. To reach this goal, we plan to use different approaches to boost cognitive functions in the coming years, including psychopharmacology, direct current stimulation, mindfulness. Methylphenidate is our first psychopharmacological study towards this objective. Future work will also expand to other compounds and cognitive processes, as well as vary the strategy to induce anxiety. Presently, anxiety will be induced using the threat of shock, while participants perform the task. We will examine in step-1 whether 1) the reduction of induced-anxiety with propranolol improves cognitive performance, and 2) the facilitation of cognitive performance with methylphenidate reduces induced-anxiety. In step-2, we will identify the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of methylphenidate, the drug having beneficial effects on cognitive function.

Study population:

Medically and psychiatrically healthy adult males and females, aged 18 to 50 years.

Design:

The study is a double-blind design. For step-1, three groups of healthy participants will come for one experimental session. During this session, they will be asked to perform a working memory task under the threat of shock, i.e., while anticipating unpleasant electric shocks. Each group will receive one drug challenge, either placebo, propranolol (40 g) or methylphenidate (20 mg). For step-2, the study tasks will be conducted in a 3T fMRI scanner. In this step, only methylphenidate and placebo will be compared. Two groups will come for one experimental session, one will receive placebo and the other one will receive methylphenidate (20 mg). In a follow-up study for the step-2 fMRI the two groups will come for one experimental fMRI session one will receive methylphenidate (60 mg).

Outcome measures:

In step-1, the primary outcome measures are the startle reflex and performance on the working memory task. In step-2, the primary outcome measures are the startle reflex and the cerebral fMRI blood-oxygen-level ...","This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study examined how pharmacologically enhancing working memory with methylphenidate (MPH) modifies the interaction between anxiety and cognitive performance in healthy adults. Fifty right‑handed volunteers received a single oral dose of 20 mg immediate‑release MPH or placebo and then performed an N‑back working memory task (1‑back, 3‑back) during functional MRI under two conditions: safety and threat of unpredictable electric shock (induced anxiety). The main hypothesis was that MPH would alter the balance between the fronto‑parietal control network (FPCN) and default mode network (DMN), potentially expanding overall neural processing resources so that both demanding cognition and anxiety‑related processing could be supported without mutual interference. The study assessed working memory accuracy and reaction times, subjective anxiety, and task‑related BOLD activation to test whether cognitive enhancement can facilitate anxiety processing while preserving or improving cognitive performance.",True,0.86,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False

Prior behavioral work suggested that while anxiety typically impairs cognition, performing a demanding task can lessen anxiety, and that cognitive resources may be more expandable than traditional limited‑capacity models propose. The present experiment extended those findings to the neural level using functional MRI.

Seventy healthy volunteers were initially recruited; after exclusions (missing fMRI data, incomplete behavioral data, excessive head motion), the final sample comprised 50 healthy, right‑handed adults without current or past Axis I psychiatric disorders or significant medical/neurological conditions and without family history of psychiatric disorders in first‑degree relatives. Participants were free of psychotropic medications, tobacco, and illicit drugs, and had IQ ≥ 80 and no prior chronic MPH use. All provided informed consent under a National Institute of Mental Health IRB‑approved protocol.

The study used a randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, between‑subjects design. Participants received a single oral dose of either 20 mg immediate‑release MPH (Ritalin) or placebo, in identical capsules, 90 minutes before beginning the experimental task in a 3 T MRI scanner. This dosing and timing were chosen based on prior work indicating cognitive effects at this dose and known pharmacokinetics (peak plasma levels at approximately 1–2 hours). Side effects were monitored with a clinician‑administered 34‑item Adverse Events Checklist.

Cognitive function was probed with an N‑back working memory (WM) task using visually presented letters. Two WM loads were tested: 1‑back (low load) and 3‑back (high load). In each block, letters were presented sequentially, and participants responded whether the current letter matched the letter N positions back. Approximately one‑third of trials were targets. An instruction screen indicated the upcoming load (1‑back or 3‑back) before each block.

Anxiety was experimentally induced using the threat of unpredictable electric shocks. Task blocks occurred in two alternating contexts: ""Safe"" blocks (signaled by blue color around stimuli), during which participants were told no shocks would occur, and ""Threat"" blocks (orange color), during which unpredictable shocks could be delivered at any time. Participants received a total of six shocks during the task (three per run), with intensity calibrated individually beforehand. Thus, anxiety was manipulated independently of working memory load.

The task consisted of two runs separated by about 10 minutes. Each run included eight blocks of 45 seconds, with 18 letter trials per block. Within each run, there were two blocks of each condition: 1‑back/safe, 1‑back/threat, 3‑back/safe, and 3‑back/threat, with safe and threat blocks alternating. The order of runs (starting with safe vs. threat) was counterbalanced across participants. Run‑1 represented a context of relative task novelty, whereas Run‑2 reflected increased familiarity.

Functional MRI data were acquired on a 3 T Siemens Skyra system using multi‑echo EPI and high‑resolution multi‑echo T1‑weighted MPRAGE structural images. Preprocessing and analysis were conducted with AFNI and FreeSurfer, including optimal combination of multi‑echo images, skull stripping, nonlinear normalization to ICBM 2009c space, motion correction, and modeling of nuisance regressors (motion parameters, low‑frequency drifts, shock onsets). At the first level, separate regressors modeled each task condition (1‑back/safe, 1‑back/threat, 3‑back/safe, 3‑back/threat), and a general linear test contrasted 3‑back vs. 1‑back to isolate WM load effects. Second‑level analyses used mixed‑effects general linear models with Drug (MPH vs. placebo), Condition (safe vs. threat), Run (1 vs. 2), and Load contrast (3‑back vs. 1‑back) as fixed factors, Subjects as random factor, and sex and age as covariates. Whole‑brain correction for multiple comparisons used cluster‑level thresholding with 3dClustSim.

Behavioral performance (accuracy and reaction times) was analyzed using linear mixed‑effects models with Drug, Load, Condition, and Run as fixed effects, Subjects as a random effect, and sex and age as covariates. General state anxiety was assessed via the STAI‑state scale at three time points: immediately after drug administration (before expected pharmacologic action), 45 minutes post‑dose, and after exiting the scanner. Additional anxiety measures during fMRI were collected but detailed in supplemental material.

As a quality‑control step, the 3‑back vs. 1‑back contrast reliably activated task‑positive regions (fronto‑parietal control network) and deactivated task‑negative regions (default mode network), consistent with past working memory literature. Behaviorally, higher WM load (3‑back) produced lower accuracy and slower reaction times than 1‑back, and performance improved from Run‑1 to Run‑2.

MPH tended to improve overall working memory accuracy compared to placebo across conditions. The key hypotheses concerned how MPH would affect the functional balance between the fronto‑parietal control network (FPCN) and the default mode network (DMN) under anxiety and cognitive load. Three mechanistic scenarios were proposed: (A) MPH increases dissociation between FPCN and DMN (stronger FPCN activation with greater DMN deactivation); (B) MPH redistributes cognitive resources with greater efficiency (reduced FPCN activation, increased DMN activation); or (C) MPH expands overall neural resources, simultaneously enhancing FPCN and DMN engagement.

Neuroimaging results during Run‑1 (when the task was novel and thus most demanding) under threat showed a Drug × Condition interaction. Under threat in Run‑1, the MPH group exhibited significantly stronger activation than placebo in parietal and cingulate regions, including left superior parietal lobule (a posterior FPCN node) and PCU/PCC, as well as in the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex and left lateral occipital cortex. Decomposition revealed that during Run‑1/safe, FPCN regions were activated and DMN regions were relatively unchanged in both groups. However, during Run‑1/threat, MPH preserved or increased activation in FPCN regions (e.g., SPL) while also maintaining or enhancing activation in DMN regions (PCU, PCC, lateral OFC), whereas placebo was associated with task‑related activation in FPCN under safe conditions but a loss of activation (or deactivation) in these and DMN regions under threat.

This pattern is consistent with the ""resource expansion"" hypothesis: in the most demanding context (high WM load, induced anxiety, novel task), MPH appears to expand available neural processing resources, allowing simultaneous robust recruitment of FPCN for cognitive performance and DMN for processing anxiety‑related, self‑referential or internally directed information, instead of enforcing a strict competition between the two networks. In contrast, placebo subjects showed more canonical task‑related activation/deactivation patterns that suggest limited capacity, with anxiety‑related demands reducing effective recruitment of these systems during high load.

By Run‑2, when the task was more familiar and presumably less demanding, the Drug × Condition interaction no longer yielded significant clusters at the whole‑brain level. Although there were trends for somewhat greater FPCN activation and less DMN deactivation with MPH, MPH and placebo did not significantly differ in neural or behavioral measures in this later run. This supports the idea that MPH effects are most evident under high task demand, high anxiety, and novelty.

Subjective state anxiety increased over the course of the visit in both groups, with a significant Drug × Time interaction indicating a steeper increase in STAI‑state scores in the MPH group. Average anxiety levels did not differ between groups overall, but the time course suggested that MPH may facilitate awareness or processing of anxiety. Importantly, enhanced working memory performance in the MPH group occurred despite equal or greater subjective anxiety, consistent with the idea that expanded resources can support both cognitive demands and anxiety processing concurrently.

The authors interpret these findings as evidence that cognitive resources are not strictly limited but can be expanded pharmacologically under certain conditions. MPH seems to increase the capacity of networks supporting both executive control (FPCN) and self‑referential/emotion‑related processing (DMN), enabling more complete processing and potential regulation of anxiety without compromising ongoing cognitive performance. This challenges dominant limited‑resource models of anxiety–cognition interactions and suggests new avenues for therapeutic strategies that aim to enhance cognitive capacity or its flexible allocation in the context of anxiety disorders. The study is limited by its healthy volunteer sample, absence of plasma MPH measurements, lack of physiological anxiety measures in the scanner comparable to prior work, and the fact that stimulants are not clinical treatments for anxiety. Nonetheless, it provides proof‑of‑concept support for the neural expandability of processing resources relevant to anxiety regulation.",True,0.93,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
