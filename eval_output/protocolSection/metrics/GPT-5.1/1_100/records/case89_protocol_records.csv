GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,TP,TP,"Background The management of patients with symptomatic nonacute intracranial artery occlusion (sNA-ICAO), which is a special subset with high morbidity and a high probability of recurrent serious ischemic events despite standard medical therapy (SMT), has been clinically challenging. Some small-sample clinical studies have also discussed endovascular recanalization for sNA-ICAO; however, there is currently a lack of evidence from multicenter, prospective, large-sample cohort trials. The aim of our present study was to evaluate the technical feasibility and safety of endovascular recanalization for sNA-ICAO.

Methods and analysis: Our group is currently undertaking a multisite, nonrandomized cohort, prospective registry study enrolling consecutive patients presenting with sNA-ICAO at 15 centers in China between May 1, 2020, and April 30, 2023. A cohort of patients who received SMT and a cohort of similar patients who received ER plus SMT were constructed and followed up for 2 years. The primary outcome is the composite of stroke/TIA within 2 years following enrollment and stroke/TIA ipsilateral to the target vessel. The secondary efficacy outcome includes the following two parts: 1) the incidence of stroke/TIA ipsilateral to the target vessel within 30 days and 90 days in both groups; 2) the all-cause mortality, mRS score, NIHSS score and cognitive function at 30 days, 90 days, 8 months, 12 months and 24 months for both groups, including the MRI, CTA/MRA, CTP or MRP results in patients with internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery occlusion as well as CTA in patients with basilar or vertebral artery occlusion at 90 days, 12 months and 24 months. Descriptive statistics and linear/logistic multiple regression models will be generated. Clinical relevance will be measured as relative risk reduction, absolute risk reduction and the number needed to treat.

Ethics and dissemination This study protocol was reviewed and approved primarily by Beijing Tiantan Hospital, the Capital Medical University Medical Ethics Committee, and the institutional review boards of all partner sites. The study is being externally monitored, and the results will be published in open-access peer-reviewed scientific journals and presented to academic and policy stakeholders.","This multicenter, prospective, non-randomized cohort registry in 15 centers in China evaluates whether endovascular recanalization (ER) combined with standard medical therapy (SMT) is feasible, safe, and potentially more effective than SMT alone for patients with symptomatic non-acute intracranial artery occlusion (sNA-ICAO). Consecutive patients with imaging- and clinically-confirmed sNA-ICAO (24 hours to 6 months from onset) are treated either with SMT alone or with ER plus SMT and followed for 2 years. The main outcome is the occurrence of any stroke during follow-up, with additional assessments of mortality, disability, neurologic deficits, and cognitive function.",True,0.98,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,EV,EV,,"This study is a multicenter, prospective registry, non-randomized cohort trial conducted at 15 centers across China to investigate the technical feasibility and safety of endovascular recanalization (ER) for symptomatic non-acute intracranial artery occlusion (sNA-ICAO). sNA-ICAO refers to intracranial large artery occlusion in patients who remain symptomatic between 24 hours and 6 months after onset, despite standard medical therapy (SMT), and is associated with high morbidity and a high risk of recurrent ischemic events.

Eligible patients are identified by clinical evaluation and vascular imaging (MRA, CTA, or DSA) confirming sNA-ICAO. From January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2022, consecutive patients are enrolled and assigned to one of two cohorts based on clinical judgment and patient/family preference: (1) SMT alone or (2) ER plus SMT. Both cohorts share the same inclusion/exclusion criteria and outcome measures. SMT includes dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel for 90 days followed by long-term single antiplatelet therapy, as well as intensive management of vascular risk factors such as blood pressure and LDL cholesterol, lifestyle counseling, and coordination of care for comorbidities.

For ER, patients receive dual antiplatelet therapy before the procedure. Under general anesthesia, experienced interventional neuroradiologists perform endovascular recanalization using a guiding catheter, microcatheter, and micro guidewire to cross the occluded segment, followed by balloon angioplasty and, when needed, stent implantation to restore vessel patency. Successful revascularization is defined as modified TICI grade 2b or 3 with residual stenosis <50%. For internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (MCA M1) occlusions, ipsilateral hypoperfusion is confirmed by CT or MR perfusion imaging; perfusion data may be processed by the RAPID system using DEFUSE 3 criteria.

All patients undergo standardized data collection at baseline, including demographics, vascular risk factors, stroke history and symptoms, morphology of the occlusion, time from occlusion and last symptoms to recanalization (for ER patients), functional status (modified Rankin Scale [mRS]), neurological deficits (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS]), and, for anterior circulation lesions, cognitive testing. Cognitive assessment covers memory, executive function, processing speed, and attention/working memory using components of the Chinese version of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale and other tests (animal naming, letter fluency, digit span).

Patients are followed at 30 days, 3 months, 8 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months after enrollment. The primary endpoint is any stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) occurring from enrollment to 2 years. Secondary outcomes include all-cause mortality, mRS score, NIHSS score, and longitudinal cognitive function. Stroke is defined using World Health Organization criteria. Major stroke is defined as an NIHSS score ≥6 at least 30 days after onset, and mild stroke as an NIHSS deterioration of ≤4 points with corresponding diffusion-weighted MRI changes or as adjudicated by a stroke committee. All clinical events are adjudicated by an independent committee blinded to treatment allocation.

The planned sample size is 160 patients in the ER plus SMT group and 320 in the SMT-alone group (1:2 allocation), based on an expected 2-year ipsilateral ischemic stroke rate of approximately 10% for ER plus SMT and 20% for SMT alone, with 80% power and a 5% two-sided alpha, accounting for non-participation and dropout. Preprocedural complication rates exceeding 15% (e.g., arterial dissection, perforation, thrombus migration, subacute stent thrombosis, hemorrhage, or death) are set as safety termination criteria.

Statistical analyses include descriptive statistics and comparative tests (chi-square, t-test, Mann–Whitney U). Cox proportional hazards models will estimate the risk of mortality and ischemic events. Multivariable models will adjust for age, sex, baseline NIHSS and mRS, baseline cognitive function, medical history, prior ischemic stroke, time from last neurologic event, and occlusion site. Propensity score matching (1:1 nearest neighbor, caliper 0.2 of the propensity score) will be used in sensitivity analyses to address treatment-selection bias, matching on age, baseline neurologic and functional status, cognitive function, occlusion location, and medical history.

Data management is centralized under a Scientific Committee, with secure, anonymized, web-based data entry and site-specific access. The study adheres to the Declaration of Helsinki, and all participants provide written informed consent. Ethics approval was obtained from the Beijing Tiantan Hospital ethics committee and institutional review boards of all participating centers. The results are intended to provide higher-level evidence on the role of ER plus SMT versus SMT alone in preventing recurrent stroke and improving functional and cognitive outcomes in patients with sNA-ICAO.",,,,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,True,False,True,False,False,False
