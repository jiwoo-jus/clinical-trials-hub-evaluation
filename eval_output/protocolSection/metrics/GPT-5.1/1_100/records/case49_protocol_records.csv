GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,TP,TP,"This study aims to determine whether a combination a first-line antidepressant plus ""RT2CK17"" in a capsule relative to a first-line antidepressant plus placebo in a capsule results in higher rates of medication adherence in individuals with moderate to severe depression. In this double-blind randomized placebo controlled trial, 100 individuals with a Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (QIDS-SR) scale score ≥ 14 will be enrolled to participate in an 8 week treatment study. Participants will be randomized with a 1-1 ratio to receive 5 milligrams (mg) ""RT2CK17"" + 10 mg escitalopram or placebo + 10 mg escitalopram to be taken orally once per day. Participants will undergo a 3 hour baseline evaluation visit at week 0, two 30-minute office visits (week 2 and 4), one 60-minute office visit (week 8) and three 5-minute phone calls (weeks 1, 3, and 6) during which clinical assessments and measures will be obtained. The trial is designed with two stages: 20 participants in Stage 1 will be used to estimate the adherence effect size; Stage 2 is designed with an interim analysis to test our hypotheses.","This phase 2a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigated whether adding low-dose methylphenidate (MPH) to the antidepressant escitalopram improves medication adherence in adults with moderate to severe major depressive disorder. Twenty participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either 5 mg MPH + 10 mg escitalopram or placebo + 10 mg escitalopram for 8 weeks, with an optional increase of escitalopram to 20 mg at week 4. The main hypothesis was that pairing an acutely reinforcing dopaminergic/noradrenergic agent (MPH) with escitalopram would enhance formation of a medication-taking habit and increase adherence, measured by pill counts and electronic monitoring. Bayesian mixed-effects models showed no evidence that MPH improved adherence; if anything, adherence was slightly higher in the placebo group. Both groups showed clinically meaningful improvements in depressive symptoms, and attitudes toward medication and sociodemographic factors did not significantly affect adherence. The study concluded that low-dose MPH does not improve adherence to antidepressant medication in this population.",True,0.92,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,EV,EV,,"This study addressed the problem of poor adherence to antidepressant pharmacotherapy in individuals with moderate to severe depression. Non-adherence is common in mental health care and is associated with worse clinical outcomes and higher health care costs. The trial was based on the premise that building a robust habit of daily medication-taking may be facilitated by pairing a standard antidepressant with an agent that provides an acute positive reinforcing effect via dopaminergic and noradrenergic mechanisms. Methylphenidate (MPH), a monoamine reuptake inhibitor that increases synaptic dopamine and norepinephrine and is widely used in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, was selected as the augmentation agent.

This was a phase 2a, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study with two parallel arms. Adults aged 18–65 years with non-remitted major depressive disorder and baseline QIDS-SR scores ≥14 (moderate to severe depression) were enrolled. Key exclusions included major medical contraindications to MPH (e.g., serious cardiac disease, uncontrolled hypertension, glaucoma), bipolar or psychotic disorders, current alcohol or substance use disorders (except nicotine), prior intolerance to study medications, and current psychiatric medication use.

Participants (n=20) were randomized 1:1 using block randomization to receive: (1) Study Drug A: placebo 5 mg + escitalopram 10 mg, or (2) Study Drug B: MPH 5 mg + escitalopram 10 mg. Study drugs were compounded into identical capsules and dispensed in Medication Electronic Monitoring System (MEMS) bottles. At week 4, the treating psychiatrist could increase escitalopram to 20 mg (with either placebo or MPH maintained at 5 mg) in cases of insufficient clinical improvement. Medication was prescribed for 8 weeks, with in-person visits at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 8 and telephone contacts at weeks 1, 3, and 6. Usual care could continue, but new treatments were not permitted during the trial.

The primary endpoint was adherence assessed by pill count, defined as percent of prescribed doses taken over the interval between visits: 100 × (pills dispensed − pills remaining) / days between dispensing and return. The secondary endpoint was adherence measured using the MEMS caps, defined (per the STAR*D protocol) as the percentage of doses taken within ±25% of the expected dosing interval, operationalized as ±6 hours around an individualized expected time derived from participants’ dosing patterns. Exploratory endpoints included depressive symptom severity on the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology – Self-Report (QIDS-SR), remission (QIDS-SR ≤5), response (≥50% symptom reduction), and attitudinal measures from the Beliefs About Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ), examining whether medication beliefs influenced adherence.

A Bayesian linear mixed-effects modeling framework was used for analysis. Fixed effects included treatment (MPH vs placebo), visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, with random intercepts for participants. For adherence outcomes, visits at weeks 2, 4, and 8 were modeled; the contrast of interest was the between-group difference at week 8. For QIDS-SR, visits at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 were modeled, and the main contrast was the difference between treatments in change from baseline to week 8. Analyses were performed with weakly informative default priors (rstanarm package) and, for adherence outcomes, also with informative priors encoding a prior belief that MPH would outperform placebo. Posterior distributions, credible intervals, and posterior probabilities that MPH adherence exceeded placebo adherence were estimated. Participants who withdrew or were lost to follow-up were retained in intention-to-treat analyses and coded as non-adherent for subsequent scheduled observations.

All 20 randomized participants (10 per arm) received the allocated treatment and were included in the primary and secondary endpoint analyses. Four participants discontinued early (three due to medication side effects—two in the MPH arm, one in the placebo arm—and one MPH participant due to missed appointments). No serious adverse events were reported. Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics, including QIDS-SR scores, did not differ significantly between groups.

Adherence by pill count was high in both arms (overall averages approximately 89% for placebo and 76% for MPH across visits). Due to skewed distributions, adherence percentages were analyzed on a logit scale. The estimated marginal means showed slightly lower adherence for the MPH group over time. Posterior contrasts indicated that at week 8 the probability that MPH would produce higher adherence than placebo was below 15% with weakly informative priors and about 25% with informative priors, providing no evidence that MPH improved adherence. Placebo adherence was, on average, about 7–8 percentage points higher than MPH on the primary outcome.

MEMS-based adherence results were consistent with the pill-count findings. Estimated trajectories showed similar adherence between groups at weeks 2 and 4, with slightly lower adherence in the MPH group at week 8. The posterior probability that MPH yielded higher MEMS adherence than placebo at week 8 was under 21% with default priors and approximately 36% with informative priors, again failing to support superiority of MPH.

Regarding depressive symptoms, both treatment arms exhibited substantial QIDS-SR score reductions over the 8-week period, with a median decrease of approximately 8.6 points across groups. The Bayesian model suggested that the change in QIDS-SR from baseline to week 8 in the MPH group was on average 1.2 points lower than in the placebo group, but the 95% credible interval ranged from MPH being modestly worse to modestly better (approximately +2.1 to −4.5 points), indicating no clear between-group difference in antidepressant response. Thus, the lack of an adherence benefit with MPH did not appear to be due to inadequate antidepressant efficacy overall.

Exploratory analyses examined whether participants’ beliefs about medicines (BMQ general harm and overuse subscales), age, or sex explained variability in adherence. These covariates did not meaningfully alter the primary or secondary outcome conclusions, and BMQ measures showed negligible associations with adherence in this small sample, despite prior literature indicating that necessity-concerns beliefs often predict adherence in larger cohorts.

The study was originally designed as a two-stage program (pilot stage 1 with 20 participants, followed by stage 2 with an additional 80 participants) with group sequential monitoring and pre-specified stopping rules. After completion of stage 1, Bayesian results indicated that the observed adherence patterns were opposite to the primary hypothesis and that the posterior probability of clinically meaningful superiority of MPH over placebo was low. On this basis, the trial was terminated after the pilot phase, and stage 2 was not initiated.

The investigators concluded that low-dose MPH augmentation of escitalopram does not improve short-term medication adherence in adults with moderate to severe major depressive disorder and that the probability of benefit is low enough to discourage a larger confirmatory trial under the same conditions. The authors discussed potential explanations, including the already high adherence rates in this controlled research setting, the relatively low MPH dose, and the limited 8-week follow-up, as well as the broader difficulty of designing effective adherence-enhancing interventions. They emphasized that, while dopamine-mediated reinforcement mechanisms are theoretically relevant to habit formation, this specific pharmacologic strategy did not yield practical gains in adherence in the studied population.",,,,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,True,False,True,False,False,False
