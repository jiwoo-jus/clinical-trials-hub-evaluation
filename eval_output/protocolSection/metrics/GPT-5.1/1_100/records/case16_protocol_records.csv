Participants aged 18 years or older, unvaccinated and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, were enrolled within 120 hours of exposure and randomized 1:1 to receive one unit of high titer CCP or one unit of non-immune control plasma. The main outcome was whether participants developed SARS-CoV-2 infection within 28 days, based on RT-PCR testing of nasal swabs or clinical tests. Among 168 evaluable participants, the rates of infection and symptomatic COVID-19 were similar in the CCP and control groups, and CCP did not significantly prolong infection-free time.

GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"This randomized, controlled, double-blinded phase 2 trial will assess the efficacy and safety of Anti- SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma as prophylaxis following exposure to COVID-19 (as defined in the inclusion criteria). Adults 18 years of age and older with high risk exposure as defined by CDC may participate. A total of 500 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either high titer anti-SARS-CoV-2 plasma or control (SARS-CoV-2 non-immune plasma).","This study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma (CCP) as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for COVID-19. The underlying hypothesis was that passive immunotherapy with high titer anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, delivered as CCP prior to symptom onset or detectable infection, might prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in exposed but uninfected individuals.

Adults aged 18 years or older were eligible if they were asymptomatic, had a close contact exposure to a person with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 within the prior 120 hours, had not received SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and had no history of past or active SARS-CoV-2 infection. All participants had to have a negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result within 24 hours before transfusion. Participants were enrolled at 19 sites across the United States between June 11, 2020, and June 23, 2021.

Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio using web-based systems to receive either one unit of high titer CCP (intervention) or one unit of SARS-CoV-2 non-immune control plasma (placebo). CCP donors had documented prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, met standard blood donation criteria, and were required to have anti–SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers ≥1:320 by Euroimmun ELISA. After the FDA Emergency Use Authorization for CCP, additional criteria included a Euroimmun IgG ratio ≥3.5 at a 1:101 dilution. Control plasma was collected before January 1, 2020 or was confirmed seronegative for SARS-CoV-2. CCP units generally had high anti-spike IgG endpoint titers (mostly >1:1000) and neutralizing antibody titers typically between 1:20 and 1:640.

The primary efficacy endpoint was incident SARS-CoV-2 infection through day 28, as determined by positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR from scheduled study nasal swabs or clinical testing performed outside the study. Follow-up visits were scheduled at days 0 (transfusion), 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, 60, and 90. Nasal swabs for viral testing were obtained at screening (days −1 to 0) and on days 1, 7, 14, and 28. Symptomatic infection (COVID-19) was assessed repeatedly through day 60. A secondary clinical endpoint was disease severity through day 28, measured by an ordinal clinical event scale ranging from no infection to death.

The primary analysis used a modified intention-to-treat population, including all randomized and transfused participants who were RT-PCR negative at baseline. Time-to-event methods were employed, with restricted mean infection-free time (RMIFT) by day 28 as the primary measure. Targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) was used to estimate differences in RMIFT and risk differences between groups, adjusting for prognostic baseline variables identified via random survival forests. Analyses were also repeated considering only symptomatic COVID-19 as the event and in a pre-specified sensitivity analysis restricted to participants who remained infection-free through day 4 to account for a potential delay in CCP effect.

Of 1,138 screened individuals, 180 were enrolled and randomized, and 170 were transfused (82 CCP, 88 control). Two transfused participants were excluded from efficacy analyses due to baseline RT-PCR positivity, yielding 168 participants in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (81 CCP, 87 control). The median time from exposure to transfusion was 2 days (IQR 1–4). Seven participants did not complete all study procedures but contributed follow-up time until loss to follow-up.

For the primary endpoint, 12 of 81 (14.8%) CCP recipients and 13 of 87 (14.9%) control recipients developed RT-PCR–confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by day 28. The RMIFT through 28 days was 25.3 days in the CCP arm and 25.2 days in the control arm, with no significant difference between groups (p-values around 0.47–0.49; risk difference approximately 0.01 in favor of CCP, not statistically significant). When infections detected on days 1–3 were excluded to allow time for passive antibody effect, RMIFT increased slightly in the CCP group relative to control, but differences remained non-significant.

Symptomatic COVID-19 developed in 6 of 81 (7.4%) CCP recipients and 7 of 87 (8.0%) control recipients. The RMIFT for symptomatic COVID-19 by day 28 was 26.3 days for CCP versus 25.9 days for control, again indicating no statistically significant prophylactic benefit. Two COVID-19-related hospitalizations occurred, both in control plasma recipients; none occurred among CCP recipients, but numbers were too small to draw firm efficacy conclusions for severe outcomes.

Disease severity assessed by the ordinal clinical event scale was similar between the two arms, with odds ratios close to 1 for both all post-transfusion events and events occurring more than 3 days after transfusion. Analyses examining relationships between donor antibody titers (including anti-spike and anti-RBD IgG AUC measures) and infection risk among CCP recipients found no significant association and no clear dose–response relationship.

Safety was a key component of the trial. Adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and transfusion reactions were systematically collected and reviewed by an independent, blinded safety monitor. Overall, 86 AEs were reported: 58 in CCP recipients and 28 in control plasma recipients, with 17 grade 3 or 4 events. Five participants required hospitalization (including two for COVID-19), all in the control group. CCP recipients had a lower proportion of any AEs and a trend toward fewer severe AEs. There was no evidence of antibody-dependent enhancement or other safety signals related to CCP administration, including in the early period following transfusion.

The trial did not reach its planned sample size of 500 transfused participants due to declining enrollment with widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine-related eligibility constraints. A prespecified conditional power analysis indicated that even if the target sample size had been achieved, the probability of demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in infection with CCP PEP would have been very low.

In summary, this trial demonstrates that administration of a single unit of high titer SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma as post-exposure prophylaxis within 120 hours of close contact exposure is safe but does not significantly reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection or symptomatic COVID-19 in generally healthy, unvaccinated adults. The findings suggest that the antibody dose and composition achievable with standard single-unit CCP may be insufficient to prevent upper respiratory tract infection, especially compared with higher-dose monoclonal antibody regimens. Future prophylaxis studies may need to explore higher antibody doses, multiple units, very high-titer CCP, or targeting high-risk populations such as immunocompromised or elderly individuals, focusing on clinically meaningful outcomes such as hospitalization and severe disease.",True,0.82,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
