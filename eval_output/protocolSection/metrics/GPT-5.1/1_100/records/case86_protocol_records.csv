A total of 158 participants from 52 sites in 10 countries were randomized 1:1:1 to high‑dose deutetrabenazine, low‑dose deutetrabenazine, or placebo. Study medication was titrated over 4 weeks to a weight- and CYP2D6‑guided target dose, followed by a 4‑week maintenance period and 1‑week washout and follow‑up. The primary outcome was change from baseline to week 8 in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale–Total Tic Score (YGTSS‑TTS) for high‑dose deutetrabenazine vs placebo. Deutetrabenazine did not show a statistically significant benefit over placebo at week 8, although there were numerical improvements during the titration phase.

GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,EV,EV,,"The ARTISTS 2 (Alternatives for Reducing Tics in Tourette Syndrome 2) study was a multinational, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of fixed doses of deutetrabenazine in pediatric patients with Tourette syndrome. Deutetrabenazine is a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor approved in adults for chorea associated with Huntington disease and for tardive dyskinesia. Previous open-label data in adolescents with Tourette syndrome suggested clinically meaningful tic reduction with deutetrabenazine, prompting this confirmatory trial.

Children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years, weighing at least 20 kg, who met DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for Tourette syndrome and had active, distressing or impairing tics (YGTSS-Total Tic Score ≥20 at screening and baseline) were eligible. Key exclusions included stereotypy related to autism spectrum disorder, clinically significant obsessive-compulsive disorder judged to be the primary cause of impairment, and clinically significant depression at baseline. Participants were recruited from 52 sites across 10 countries (United States, Argentina, Australia, Colombia, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Republic of Korea, and Ukraine).

Participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to high-dose deutetrabenazine (up to 48 mg/day), low-dose deutetrabenazine (up to 36 mg/day), or matching placebo. Randomization was stratified by age group (6–11 vs 12–16 years). Target doses were predefined based on baseline body weight category (≥40 kg, 30 to <40 kg, or 20 to <30 kg) and cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) impairment status (poor metabolizers or those receiving strong CYP2D6 inhibitors vs others). Doses were titrated over 4 weeks while balancing perceived efficacy and adverse events, then maintained for 4 additional weeks, followed by a 1‑week washout and 1‑week follow-up period.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to week 8 in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale–Total Tic Score (YGTSS-TTS) for high-dose deutetrabenazine compared with placebo. The YGTSS is a semistructured, clinician-administered scale that rates motor and phonic tic number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference over the prior week; motor and vocal tic subscores (0–25 each) are summed to yield the TTS (0–50). Key secondary endpoints included: (1) change in Tourette Syndrome Clinical Global Impression (TS-CGI) score for high-dose deutetrabenazine vs placebo; (2) change in YGTSS-TTS for low-dose deutetrabenazine vs placebo; (3) change in TS-CGI for low-dose deutetrabenazine vs placebo; (4) change in Tourette Syndrome Patient Global Impression of Impact (TS-PGII) for each deutetrabenazine dose vs placebo; and (5) change in Child and Adolescent Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome–Quality of Life (CA-GTS-QOL) Activities of Daily Living (ADL) subscale score for each deutetrabenazine dose vs placebo. Exploratory efficacy analyses included the proportion of YGTSS responders (≥25% reduction in TTS from baseline) and changes in YGTSS motor and vocal tic subscores.

The primary analysis used a mixed model for repeated measures with change in YGTSS-TTS as the dependent variable and treatment group, week, and treatment-by-week interaction as fixed effects, adjusting for baseline YGTSS-TTS, region, and age group. Secondary continuous outcomes were analyzed similarly; TS-PGII and responder analyses used Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel methods. A hierarchical testing strategy controlled the family-wise type I error rate at 5%.

Among 193 screened participants, 158 were randomized (52 high-dose deutetrabenazine, 54 low-dose deutetrabenazine, 52 placebo), and 145 (91.8%) completed the study. The mean age was 11.7 years; 75% were boys. The mean time since Tourette syndrome diagnosis was 3.3 years, and mean baseline YGTSS-TTS was 33.8 points, indicating moderate to severe tics. Comorbid psychiatric conditions were common, particularly attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, and depression. Prior treatment for Tourette syndrome and use of psychotropic medications (e.g., antipsychotics, stimulants) were reported in a substantial proportion of participants.

At week 8, deutetrabenazine did not demonstrate a statistically significant advantage over placebo for the primary endpoint. The least-squares mean change from baseline in YGTSS-TTS was −7.8 points in the high-dose group and −7.0 points in the placebo group, yielding a least-squares mean difference of −0.8 points (95% CI, −3.9 to 2.3; P = .60; Cohen d, −0.11). None of the key secondary endpoints showed nominally significant differences between either deutetrabenazine dose and placebo. Notably, numerical improvements in YGTSS-TTS, TS-CGI, TS-PGII, and CA-GTS-QOL ADL scores favored deutetrabenazine over placebo at the end of the titration period (week 4), but the placebo group showed a steeper improvement between weeks 4 and 8, consistent with a strong placebo response during maintenance.

Responder analyses similarly showed early signals favoring deutetrabenazine. In the high-dose group, the proportion of YGTSS-TTS responders (≥25% reduction) increased from 12% at week 2 to 42% at week 4 and 50% at week 8, compared with 20% and 39% at weeks 4 and 8, respectively, in the placebo group. The low-dose group had numerically higher responder rates than placebo at weeks 2 and 4, with convergence by week 8. Exploratory analyses of YGTSS motor and vocal tic subscores indicated numeric advantages for deutetrabenazine vs placebo during titration, particularly for motor tics.

Safety was assessed via treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and standardized assessments for depression and suicidality (Children’s Depression Inventory 2 and the children’s Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale). Overall, TEAEs occurred in 65% of participants in the high-dose deutetrabenazine group, 44% in the low-dose group, and 49% in the placebo group. Most events were mild or moderate. There were no deaths and only one serious TEAE, which was deemed unrelated to study drug and occurred in a participant with ADHD following discontinuation of atomoxetine.

Common TEAEs more frequent with deutetrabenazine than placebo included headache, somnolence, nasopharyngitis, increased appetite, fatigue, and nausea. Rates of TEAEs within standardized MedDRA queries for depression and suicide/self-injury were low. Quantitative depression scores did not worsen over time in any group, and suicidal ideation was infrequent and similar between deutetrabenazine and placebo. No participants exhibited suicidal behavior during the trial. There were no clinically meaningful abnormalities in clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, electrocardiogram measures, or metabolic markers such as glucose and lipids. Mean weight gain over 8 weeks was modestly higher with deutetrabenazine than placebo but did not result in notable BMI category shifts.

Overall, this fixed-dose phase 3 trial in children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint and showed no statistically significant benefits on key secondary measures when deutetrabenazine was compared with placebo over 8 weeks. However, deutetrabenazine was generally well tolerated, and no new or unexpected safety issues were observed compared with its established safety profile in adults with Huntington disease and tardive dyskinesia. The pattern of early improvement followed by strong placebo response highlights challenges in demonstrating drug–placebo differences in tic disorders and suggests that longer treatment durations, different dosing strategies, or alternative endpoints may be needed to fully characterize potential benefits of VMAT2 inhibition in pediatric Tourette syndrome.",,,,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,True,False,True,False,False,False
