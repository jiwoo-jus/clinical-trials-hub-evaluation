GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,FP,"Approximately 1760 infants are to be enrolled at approximately 18 Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network (NRN) Centers (approximately 44 sites) in the United States. Infants meeting the study selection criteria and for whom informed consent is obtained will be randomized to receive either 80 mg inositol/kg/day or placebo, administered in divided doses every 12 hours (40 mg/kg/dose). Study drug will be administered daily, starting within 12 to 72 hours of birth and continued until the earliest of 34 weeks PMA, 10 weeks chronologic age, or the time of hospital discharge or transfer. Inositol or placebo will be administered IV until enteral feedings reach 120ml/kg/day (or sooner if the infant is no longer receiving IV fluids), at which time the same dose and formulation will be administered enterally every 12 hours.

For publication purposes, the analysis of the primary efficacy outcome will consider the entire study population. In support of a new drug application (NDA) for use of myo-Inositol 5% Injection to increase survival without severe ROP through the determination of acute/final ROP status, the analysis of the primary efficacy outcome will be conducted for the entire study population and separately within pre-specified regulatory sub-studies created by administratively splitting infants enrolled at each study center into two sub-studies.

Assessments performed during the study include customary newborn intensive care procedures including repeat eye examinations until ROP status is final (which often extends after discharge), measurements of growth, cranial ultrasounds or other imaging per usual practice, and the collection of clinical diagnoses throughout hospitalization to evaluate other common morbidities of extreme preterm birth. Adverse events will be recorded from time of treatment initiation until 7 days after the last dose of study drug, and concurrent medications will be recorded from 24 hours prior to randomization until 7 days after the last dose of study drug or until discharge or transfer if sooner. Using the separate NICHD Follow-up protocol, longer term data will be collected at 22-26 months corrected age, including growth, neurodevelopmental testing, overall health status, rehospitalizations, surgeries and diagnoses, including ophthalmic diagnoses and treatments since discharge.","This investigation is a secondary analysis of the ""Inositol to Reduce Retinopathy of Prematurity"" randomized controlled trial (NCT01954082), which enrolled infants born extremely preterm (<28 weeks’ gestation) at 18 centers in the NICHD Neonatal Research Network between April 2014 and September 2015. The original trial evaluated whether myo-inositol affected the incidence or severity of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). For this secondary analysis, infants who survived to final ROP status and completed follow-up at 22–26 months’ corrected age were included.

Participants were classified into three groups based on their ROP history: (1) no ROP, (2) ROP stage ≤3 without ophthalmologic intervention, and (3) ROP with ophthalmologic intervention (retinal ablation, scleral buckling, vitrectomy, or anti-VEGF therapy). The primary objective was to determine whether children with lower stage ROP that regressed without intervention had worse neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years’ corrected age than children without ROP. A secondary objective was to compare these two groups with children who required intervention for ROP.

Neurodevelopment was assessed at 22–26 months’ corrected age using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd Edition (Bayley-III), providing composite motor, cognitive, and language scores (mean 100, SD 15). Children who were untestable because of severe delay were assigned standardized low scores. Behavioral outcomes were evaluated using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), yielding standardized T-scores across syndrome scales, internalizing, externalizing, total problems, and DSM-oriented scales. Neurologic outcomes included results of a detailed neurologic examination, diagnosis of cerebral palsy, and gross motor function classification system (GMFCS) levels. Medical history of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was also recorded.

Ophthalmologic outcomes at 22–26 months’ corrected age were documented as part of the neurologic visit and included strabismus, nystagmus, roving eye movements, ability to track 180 degrees, history of eye surgery for non-ROP indications, prescription of corrective lenses, and visual acuity (derived from parent report or medical record). Visual acuity categories distinguished normal vision, vision abnormalities, blindness with some functional vision, and blindness with no functional vision.

Baseline maternal and neonatal characteristics and early neonatal morbidities (e.g., patent ductus arteriosus, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, spontaneous intestinal perforation, intracranial hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, late-onset sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis) were compared between ROP groups. Intracranial hemorrhage was classified using Papile criteria. Small for gestational age status was defined as birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age.

Primary outcomes (Bayley-III composite scores) were analyzed using generalized linear models with ROP group as the main exposure, adjusting for gestational age, sex, maternal race, and severe intraventricular hemorrhage (grades III–IV), with study center as a random effect. A Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple primary comparisons. Secondary outcomes (neurologic, behavioral, ophthalmologic measures, ASD, GMFCS categories) were analyzed using generalized linear or modified Poisson models with similar covariate adjustment, but without multiplicity correction due to their exploratory nature. A sensitivity analysis adjusting for myo-inositol randomization group did not change the findings.

Among 506 children evaluated at 22–26 months’ corrected age, 173 (34%) had no ROP, 262 (52%) had ROP stage ≤3 without ophthalmologic intervention, and 71 (14%) had ROP with intervention. Children with ROP stage ≤3 without intervention did not differ from children without ROP in adjusted mean Bayley-III motor, cognitive, or language scores. The incidences of abnormal neurologic examination, cerebral palsy, GMFCS ≥2, and history or suspicion of ASD were also similar between these two groups. CBCL T-scores were largely comparable; although some domains (aggressive behavior, attention deficit/hyperactivity problems, externalizing problems) showed statistically lower (more favorable) scores in the ROP-without-intervention group, differences were small (<2 points) and most children in both groups scored in the normal range.

In terms of ophthalmologic outcomes, children with ROP stage ≤3 without intervention were more likely to have strabismus than those without ROP (adjusted relative risk ~2.1). There were no significant differences between these two groups in nystagmus, roving eye movements, ability to track 180 degrees, eye surgery for non-ROP indications, or prescription of corrective lenses. A small number of children with ROP stage ≤3 without intervention were blind with some functional vision, but numbers were too low for robust between-group comparisons.

In contrast, children who had ROP with ophthalmologic intervention demonstrated significantly lower mean Bayley-III motor, cognitive, and language scores compared with children who had ROP stage ≤3 without intervention. They were more likely to have GMFCS level ≥2 and hearing loss, although the overall incidence of cerebral palsy and abnormal neurologic examination did not differ significantly. CBCL behavioral profiles were similar between the intervention and non-intervention ROP groups, with most scores in the normal range. Children with treated ROP had markedly worse visual acuity, with fewer having normal vision and more having significant vision impairment or blindness. The incidence of nystagmus was higher and approached statistical significance in the intervention group, whereas other ophthalmologic measures did not differ clearly after adjustment.

The authors interpret these findings as evidence that, among extremely preterm infants, milder ROP (stage ≤3) that regresses without intervention is not associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years’ corrected age relative to no ROP, although it is associated with a higher incidence of strabismus and occasional blindness with functional vision. By contrast, ROP severe enough to require ophthalmologic treatment is linked to poorer neurodevelopmental performance, more motor impairment and hearing loss, and substantially worse visual outcomes. These results support tailoring anticipatory counseling for families of extremely preterm infants based on ROP severity, emphasizing that untreated mild ROP does not appear to worsen early neurodevelopment but still warrants ophthalmologic follow-up, while treated ROP is a marker for increased risk of both neurodevelopmental and visual impairment. The authors note limitations including reliance on reported visual acuity rather than standardized testing, potential referral and reporting biases, lack of postnatal growth data, and relatively early age of follow-up, which may not capture later-emerging difficulties in executive function and academic skills.",False,0.32,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False

* Inborn or out born infants of either gender or any race with best obstetrical estimate of gestation \<28 weeks (27 6/7 weeks and younger). Gestational age will be determined by best obstetrical estimate using the hierarchy of best obstetrical estimate using early ultrasound dating, maternal menstrual dating confirmed by examination, or neonatal gestational age assessment by physical examination.
* Alive at 12 hours.
* Age in hours up to 72 hours, although we will seek enrollment as early as feasible after consent and 12 hours.
* Informed consent signed and dated by parent and/or guardian, which includes likelihood of completing follow-up ophthalmic examinations as an outpatient, and long-term follow-up.

Exclusion Criteria

* Major congenital malformations
* Congenital malformations of the eye identified prior to randomization.
* Overt evidence of intrauterine congenital infections (""TORCH"") or life threatening impairment of renal, hepatic, or cardiac function (considered moribund).","- Inclusion Criteria:
