GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,TP,TP,"There is an urgent need for effective treatments for patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). This study will train opioid treatment programs in an evidence-based behavioral treatment called contingency management (CM). Contingency management (i.e., motivational incentives for achieving pre-defined treatment goals) is one of the only behavioral interventions shown to improve patient treatment outcomes when combined with FDA-approved pharmacotherapy. Unfortunately, however, uptake of CM in opioid treatment programs remains low. In response to the urgent need for evidence-based behavioral OUD treatments, the investigators propose a large-scale type 3 hybrid trial comparing two comprehensive strategies to promote CM implementation as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy within opioid treatment programs. The control condition is the staff training strategy used by the New England Addiction Technology Transfer Center, which consists of didactic workshop, performance feedback, and staff coaching. The experimental condition is the ATTC strategy enhanced by external leadership coaching (using a model called Implementation Sustainment Facilitation; ISF) and provider incentives (using a model called Pay for Performance; P4P).

A cluster randomized design trial will be conducted with 30 opioid treatment programs across New England. Centers will be randomized to one of the two implementation conditions (ATTC vs. enhanced-ATTC) over the 5 year project. At each opioid treatment program, data will be collected at multiple intervals from CM treatment providers, organizational leaders, and newly admitted patients. Additionally, patient charts will be randomly selected for review to examine sustainment. Data collection will include electronic medical record review, ratings of audio recordings by staff blind to condition, well-validated measures, and provider weekly report of patient encounter data. Specific Aims of the study are to experimentally compare the effect of the two conditions on implementation outcomes (Primary Aim) and on patient outcomes (Secondary Aim). An Exploratory Aim is to test whether two organization-level variables (i.e., implementation climate, leadership engagement) partially mediate the relationship between implementation condition and the key study outcomes.","This cluster-randomized type 3 hybrid trial (Project MIMIC: Maximizing Implementation of Motivational Incentives in Clinics) tests strategies to increase use of contingency management (CM) as an adjunct to medication for opioid use disorder in opioid treatment programs (OTPs). Thirty OTPs in New England are randomized to receive either a standard Addiction Technology Transfer Center (ATTC) implementation strategy (didactic training, performance feedback, and ongoing consultation) or an enhanced-ATTC strategy that adds Pay-for-Performance incentives for counselors and an Implementation & Sustainment Facilitation strategy targeting organizational motivation and readiness. Newly inducted patients on methadone or buprenorphine receive a 12-week prize-based CM intervention focused on attendance. The primary aim is to compare the two implementation strategies on CM Exposure (number of CM sessions per patient), CM Skill/Competence (fidelity ratings), and CM Sustainment (CM delivery after support ends). Secondary aims test whether patients in enhanced-ATTC sites show more opioid abstinence and fewer opioid-related problems. Exploratory analyses assess whether implementation climate and leadership engagement mediate strategy effects on implementation and patient outcomes.",True,0.96,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"Overdoses and deaths due to opioid use disorders (OUDs) have been declared a public health emergency in the United States, bringing to light an urgent need for highly effective OUD treatments. There are currently five FDA-approved medication formulations, which relative to placebo have demonstrated effectiveness in helping patients attain abstinence from opioids. Nonetheless, patients' opioid abstinence rates are sub-optimal: even when treated with the newest extended-release formulations only about 40% of patients maintain abstinence during the first 6-months of treatment. Contingency management (CM; i.e., motivational incentives for achieving pre-defined treatment goals) is one of the only behavioral interventions shown to improve patient abstinence from opioids when combined with FDA-approved pharmacotherapy. Unfortunately, however, uptake of CM in opioid treatment programs remains low.

The primary purpose of this study is to experimentally evaluate two different comprehensive training models to train opioid treatment programs in CM. A Type 3 Hybrid Trial will be conducted collecting data on both implementation and patient outcomes. Using a cluster randomized design, 30 opioid treatment programs across New England will be randomized to one of two comprehensive training conditions over a 5 year period. The control condition is the staff training strategy used by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)-funded network of Addiction Technology Transfer Centers (ATTC; i.e., didactic workshop + performance feedback + staff coaching). The experimental condition is the ATTC strategy enhanced by external leadership coaching (using a model called Implementation Sustainment Facilitation \[ISF\], i.e., leadership coaching focused on sustainment planning) and provider incentives (using a model called Pay for Performance \[P4P\]; i.e., monetary bonuses for achieving pre-defined implementation goals), hereafter referred to as E-ATTC. Elements of the E-ATTC condition were informed by our team's prior NIH-funded work evaluating organization-level implementation strategies. At each OUD treatment center, data will be collected at multiple intervals from up to 2-5 CM treatment providers (n=60-150 providers), 1-2 organizational leaders (n=30-60 leaders), and 25 newly admitted patients (n=750 patients). Additionally, 25 patient charts per center (n=750 charts) will be randomly selected for review to examine sustainment. Data collection will include electronic medical record review, ratings of audio recordings by staff blind to condition, well-validated measures, and biological verification of abstinence.

The Primary Aim of the study is to experimentally compare the effect of the two training strategies on implementation outcomes. Focal implementation outcomes include: CM Exposure (provider-level measure of the proportion of providers delivering the target number of CM sessions to at least one patient during 9-month Implementation phase), CM Competence (provider-level measure of CM quality during month Implementation phase), and CM Sustainment (organization-level measure of the proportion of programs continuing to deliver CM sessions during 6-month Sustainment phase).

The Secondary Aim of the study is to experimentally compare the effect of the two training strategies on patient outcomes. Focal patient outcomes include abstinence from opioids and opioid-related problems.

An Exploratory Aim is to test whether two provider-level variables (i.e., implementation climate, leadership engagement) partially mediate the relationship between implementation condition and the key study outcomes.

Pursuit of these aims is significant given the potential to improve the treatment of OUDs in community settings, which is one of the greatest public health challenges currently facing our nation. Major strengths of the approach include the study's experimental design (cluster randomized trial), novel implementation strategy based on mixed-methods pilot data by the investigative team, large sample of organizations (N = 30), partnership with a SAMHSA-funded national training center, and rigorously measured implementation and patient outcomes.","Project MIMIC is a 3-cohort, cluster-randomized, type 3 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial designed to improve implementation of contingency management (CM) within opioid treatment programs (OTPs) that provide medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD), primarily methadone or buprenorphine. The trial addresses the public health emergency of opioid-related overdoses by focusing on an evidence-based behavioral adjunct (CM) that remains underutilized in routine care.

Study design and setting:
- Unit of randomization: OTPs (n = 30) located in New England.
- Design: Three staggered cohorts of 8–12 OTPs each, using a type 3 hybrid design emphasizing implementation outcomes (primary aim) while also assessing patient outcomes (secondary aim).
- Each OTP undergoes: 5-month Preparation phase + 9-month Implementation phase + 6-month Sustainment phase (after removal of active project support).
- Randomization: After a baseline organizational assessment, OTPs are assigned via urn randomization to either the standard ATTC strategy (control) or the enhanced-ATTC strategy (experimental), balancing on up to three organizational variables (e.g., number of patients, state, medication mix).

Participants:
- Organizations: OTPs that dispense methadone or buprenorphine, employ at least two counselors, and induct at least one new patient per week.
- Providers: Up to 5 counselors and 2 leaders per OTP (with no upper limit for training participation), all providing or supervising MOUD-related counseling and willing to engage in CM implementation. Turnover is anticipated and addressed via a structured replacement training protocol.
- Patients: Adults (≥18 years) who have been newly inducted on MOUD within the past 30 days. The focus on early treatment is driven by high drop-out and missed-dose rates during the first 6 months of treatment.

Intervention: Prize-based contingency management
The CM intervention is based on the Petry prize-based model, previously tested in NIDA Clinical Trials Network studies and implemented in the Veterans Administration system. In this study, CM is customized at the organizational level to target verifiable weekly attendance behaviors (e.g., medication dosing, individual sessions, group sessions). Each OTP defines standardized attendance targets, potentially varying by treatment phase, but consistently applied to all CM patients.

Key CM features:
- Duration: Up to 12 weeks of CM per patient, with 14 weeks allowed to complete up to 12 CM sessions.
- Escalating draws: Patients earn fishbowl prize draws for meeting weekly attendance targets, starting with one draw and increasing by one for each consecutive on-target week; missing the target resets draws.
- Prize structure: 500 slips per fishbowl (250 non-winning with encouragement, 209 small prizes, 40 large prizes, 1 jumbo prize). Prize values are approximately $1–2 (small), $25 (large), and $100 (jumbo). Expected average cost is ~$2.83 per draw, yielding an expected maximum of about $220 per patient for full 12-week adherence.
- Delivery: CM can be conducted in-person or remotely (e.g., via telehealth), with electronic versions of fishbowls, prize menus, and supporting materials provided, especially in response to COVID-19.

Implementation strategies:
Both implementation conditions are guided by the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework. The Exploration phase was completed in prior formative work. In this protocol, activities are organized into Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment phases.

1) Standard ATTC strategy (control):
The ATTC strategy, used as a real-world control, includes three core components targeting provider-level factors (knowledge, skills, attitudes):
- Didactic training: A training-to-criterion CM workshop (traditionally a 7-hour in-person session; alternatively, 3 virtual sessions totaling ~5 hours). Content covers CM principles, exemplars, role plays, and fidelity scoring using the CM Competence Scale. Providers must achieve ≥75% on a 20-item CM Knowledge Scale; those who fail receive corrective feedback and retesting.
- Performance feedback (Preparation phase): Each counselor submits a role-played CM session audio recording rated by blinded coders with the CM Competence Scale. A mean score ≥4.0/7 across nine items is considered adequate fidelity; those below criterion receive targeted feedback.
- On-going consultation (Preparation phase): Email-based consultative support helps OTPs select prizes, set attendance targets, and stock prize cabinets.

During the Implementation phase (9 months):
- Training support: Recorded training materials, case vignettes, scripts, and resources (including telehealth CM examples) are hosted on a centralized website in English and Spanish. A weekly CM newsletter provides tips and trivia.
- Performance feedback (via CM Tracker): Counselors complete a brief Weekly Report for each CM patient, entering session date, attendance targets and actual attendance, number and type of draws, and self-rated fidelity items (first 6 items of the CM Competence Scale). The CM Tracker generates dashboards summarizing patients’ progress, anticipated draws, and fidelity. Leaders receive summaries to monitor implementation.
- Monthly CM consultation calls: A CM trainer and ATTC Director co-lead virtual consultations focusing on improving CM technique (not on broader organizational implementation issues).

Sustainment phase (6 months):
- OTPs retain access to CM training resources via the website.
- Leaders are encouraged to continue local performance feedback and supervision around CM, and counselors are encouraged to document CM in routine records. No active external implementation support is provided.

2) Enhanced ATTC strategy (experimental):
OTPs in the enhanced condition receive all components of the standard ATTC strategy plus two additional, theory-driven strategies designed to enhance extrinsic and intrinsic motivation:

A. Pay-for-Performance (P4P):
- Focus: Counselor-level extrinsic incentives during the Implementation phase.
- CM Exposure bonus: Counselors earn US $200 for each newly admitted, study-enrolled patient who completes ≥10 CM sessions within 14 weeks (a benchmark derived from trials where patients attended ≥80% of sessions).
- CM Competence bonus: Counselors earn $50 for each month their average CM Competence Scale score is ≥5.8/7 across recorded sessions, representing a high “stretch” performance level observed in prior clinical trials.
- Payment: Processed remotely and mailed within 30 days of benchmark attainment.

B. Implementation & Sustainment Facilitation (ISF):
- Focus: Organizational-level intrinsic motivation and implementation climate, targeting both leaders and CM counselors.
- Duration: Begins in month 3 of Preparation and continues monthly through the Implementation phase.
- Format: Monthly 30–60-minute virtual meetings, facilitated by an external implementation specialist, include leaders and CM counselors. Content is guided by the ISF strategy’s theoretical framework and tools (e.g., decisional balance, implementation climate exercises, performance review and planning tools) available at ISFstrategy.org.
- Goals: Engage staff; focus them on key implementation milestones; elicit perceived pros and cons of CM; and jointly plan strategies to optimize CM implementation and sustainability beyond the study’s active support.
- Financial sustainability planning: Facilitators work with leadership to identify strategies to maintain CM funding (e.g., increasing revenue, reducing costs, and lowering CM-related expenses via donations or other supports).
- Process walkthrough: Near the end of Preparation, each enhanced-ATTC OTP is offered a 2-hour CM process walkthrough to refine workflows for the Implementation phase.

Staff turnover plan:
Recognizing high turnover in substance use disorder settings (approx. 30% annually for counselors and 20% for leaders), the protocol embeds a staff turnover management plan. This includes training as many staff as possible, recording training sessions for later use, and requiring all replacement counselors to meet the same CM knowledge and competence benchmarks before delivering CM. Leaders are copied on feedback provided to replacement counselors to support local supervision.

Outcomes and data collection:
Primary implementation outcomes (Aim 1):
1) CM Exposure (patient-level):
- Definition: Number of CM sessions completed per patient in the first 14 weeks of treatment during the Implementation phase (0–12 sessions) and whether patients receive the target exposure (≥10 sessions).
- Data source: CM Tracker Weekly Reports.
- Additional exposure indicators: Number of patients receiving CM and number of counselors delivering CM per OTP, adjusted for program census to approximate reach.

2) CM Competence (provider-level):
- Definition: Quality and fidelity of CM delivery as measured with the CM Competence Scale (nine 7-point items, higher scores indicate greater competence).
- Data source: Monthly audio recordings of CM sessions submitted by counselors; rated by coders blind to condition.
- Benchmarks: Adequate fidelity threshold (≥4.0) and a high-performance benchmark (≥5.8) used for P4P incentives.

3) CM Sustainment (organizational-level):
- Definition: Extent of continued CM delivery during the 6-month Sustainment phase after removal of project support.
- Indicators: Number of patients receiving CM, number of counselors delivering CM, and number of CM sessions per patient, extracted from OTP medical records and adjusted for census.

Secondary patient outcomes (Aim 2):
1) Opioid Abstinence:
- Self-report: At 3 and 6 months post-baseline, patients report number of days in the past 30 days they used opioids (other than prescribed methadone/buprenorphine) and heroin, using a Timeline Followback-style interview.
- Objective corroboration: Providers record urine drug test dates and opioid-positive/negative results weekly in the CM Tracker.

2) Opioid-Related Problems:
- Measured using the Opioid Problem Index (11-item count of DSM-5 opioid use disorder symptoms) at 3 and 6 months, derived from the Substance Problem Index of the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs.

Exploratory mediators (Aim 3):
The trial tests whether two inner-context factors from the EPIS framework mediate the effect of implementation strategy (ATTC vs. enhanced-ATTC) on implementation and patient outcomes:
- Implementation climate: A 6-item measure of the extent to which CM is expected, supported, and rewarded in the OTP (5-point Likert scale). Mean scores are calculated for each provider and aggregated as appropriate.
- Leadership engagement: A 4-item measure assessing whether leaders are committed to, involved in, and accountable for CM implementation (7-point Likert scale), previously shown to predict implementation fidelity.

These mediators are assessed via provider surveys at the start of Preparation and midpoint of Implementation.

Data collection methods:
- Organizational and provider surveys: Capture contextual determinants (e.g., climate, leadership) and provider-level attitudes and characteristics at multiple timepoints.
- CM Tracker: Weekly structured data entry on CM delivery, fidelity, and urine test results.
- Audio recordings: Monthly CM sessions for competence ratings.
- Patient surveys: Conducted at baseline, 3, and 6 months post-baseline via phone or electronic link.

Analysis plan:
Analyses follow intent-to-treat principles. Multilevel models are used, with patients (Level 1) nested within staff (Level 2) within OTPs (Level 3). Covariates at organizational, counselor, and patient levels may be examined as moderators; if no moderation is detected, they are treated as covariates. Implementation condition (ATTC vs. enhanced-ATTC) is the primary predictor. Effect sizes are reported as Cohen’s d. Mediation analyses use multilevel structural equation modeling with bias-corrected bootstrapped confidence intervals to estimate indirect effects via implementation climate and leadership engagement, with within- and between-group effects partitioned.

Sample size and power:
Assuming an intraclass correlation of 0.05 at the organization level, 20% attrition, and auto-correlation of 0.7 for repeated measures, power calculations indicate adequate power to detect small effect sizes (d ≤ 0.37) across primary and secondary outcomes with 30 OTPs.

Ethics and oversight:
The study is approved by the Brown University IRB (single IRB of record) and monitored by a Data and Safety Monitoring Board that reviews annual progress, adverse events, and interim analyses. Risks are considered minimal and primarily involve survey burden and potential breach of confidentiality, mitigated through secure data handling and de-identification.

Overall, Project MIMIC seeks to determine whether adding Pay-for-Performance and Implementation & Sustainment Facilitation to a standard ATTC implementation package yields better CM implementation and improves patient-level opioid outcomes, and to understand how implementation climate and leadership engagement contribute to these effects.",True,0.98,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
