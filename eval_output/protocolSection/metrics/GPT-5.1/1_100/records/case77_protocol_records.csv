Twenty‑three participants aged 13–22 years with molecularly confirmed FMR1 full mutation and moderate‑to‑severe neurobehavioral impairment received OV101 5 mg once, twice, or three times daily. The main goal was to determine whether OV101 is safe and well tolerated, and secondarily to explore its impact on core behavioral problems such as irritability, anxiety, social withdrawal, hyperactivity, and other maladaptive behaviors commonly seen in FXS. OV101 was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events, and clinician‑ and caregiver‑rated measures showed an initial signal of improvement in several behavioral domains, supporting further evaluation in larger, placebo‑controlled trials.",True,0.96,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,EV,EV,,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, resulting from a full‑mutation expansion (>200 CGG repeats) in the 5′ untranslated region of the FMR1 gene, leading to epigenetic silencing and deficiency or absence of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Individuals with FXS typically show a broad spectrum of neurobehavioral abnormalities including cognitive and language impairment, anxiety, social withdrawal, hyperarousal, sensory processing difficulties, repetitive behaviors, attention deficits, irritability, aggression, and self‑injury. Evidence from Fmr1 knockout mouse models indicates reduced expression of the GABAA receptor δ subunit, decreased GABA synthesis and levels, and impaired tonic inhibition, suggesting that GABAergic dysfunction contributes to the pathophysiology of FXS and may be a therapeutic target.

Gaboxadol (OV101) is a δ‑subunit–selective, extrasynaptic GABAA receptor agonist that enhances tonic inhibition. In Fmr1 knockout mice, OV101 restored tonic inhibition in the amygdala, reduced sensory hypersensitivity and motor hyperactivity, and improved repetitive, social, and anxiety‑like behaviors. OV101 has also been previously studied in adults with insomnia, where it was generally well tolerated and improved sleep induction. Based on these preclinical and clinical data, this first interventional FXS trial was designed as a proof‑of‑concept to assess the safety, tolerability, and optimal daily dose of OV101, and to explore its effects on core behavioral symptoms in adolescent and adult males with FXS.

This multicenter, randomized (1:1:1), double‑blind, parallel‑group phase 2a trial (NCT03697161) was conducted at seven sites in the United States and one site in Israel. Male participants aged 13–22 years with clinically and molecularly confirmed FMR1 full mutation, Clinical Global Impressions–Severity (CGI‑S) score ≥4 (moderate‑to‑severe illness), and Full Scale IQ <75 were eligible. To focus on individuals with minimal FMRP expression, females were excluded. Participants with uncontrolled seizures, recent seizure episodes or changes in anticonvulsant therapy, regular use of GABAergic agents or cannabinoid derivatives, significant suicidal history, or clinically significant comorbid medical conditions were excluded. Concomitant antiepileptic or psychoactive medications (up to three) were allowed if doses were stable for at least four weeks prior to randomization and maintained throughout the study.

Participants were randomized to receive OV101 5 mg once daily (QD), twice daily (BID), or three times daily (TID) for 12 weeks. All participants took study medication three times per day (morning, afternoon, evening); OV101 was always given in the morning, and matching OV101 or placebo capsules were given in the afternoon and evening to preserve blinding across regimens. Dose adjustments were not permitted. Clinic visits occurred at weeks 2, 6, and 12 (end of treatment), with a follow‑up end‑of‑study visit between weeks 16 and 18. Adverse events, concomitant medications, and suicidality were also monitored via scheduled phone calls. Caregivers or legally authorized representatives (LARs) kept sleep diaries, and participants wore actigraphs for seven‑day intervals around key visits.

The primary objective was to evaluate safety and tolerability of OV101 over 12 weeks. Key safety endpoints included treatment‑emergent adverse events (TEAEs), treatment‑related AEs, TEAEs leading to study discontinuation, and serious adverse events (SAEs). Treatment compliance was assessed from caregiver medication diaries, with ≥80% considered compliant. The secondary objective was to explore the effect of OV101 on behavioral and emotional outcomes using a battery of clinician‑ and caregiver‑rated instruments. Clinician‑rated measures included CGI‑Improvement (CGI‑I) and CGI‑Severity (CGI‑S), including subdomains (communication and connectedness, anxiety, ADHD, and Vineland‑3 activities of daily living [ADLs]). Caregiver‑rated measures included the Aberrant Behavior Checklist–Community (ABC‑C) and its FXS‑specific factor scoring (ABC‑CFXS), the Anxiety, Depression, and Mood Scale (ADAMS), the Repetitive Behavior Scale–Revised (RBS‑R), the Short Sensory Profile‑2, and the Conners 3 scales. Exploratory endpoints included Parent Global Impressions–Severity (PGI‑S), Parent Global Impressions–Improvement (PGI‑I), and clinician‑rated visual analog scale (VAS) scores for the top three caregiver‑identified concerns (e.g., anxiety, disruptive behavior, ADLs).

Descriptive statistics were used for primary safety and secondary efficacy outcomes. Mixed‑effects models for repeated measures (MMRM) were applied to explore trends over time and potential effects of dose regimen and age group, with fixed effects for dosing regimen, visit, age group, and interaction terms, and baseline values as covariates where appropriate. Post‑hoc analyses of change or percent change from baseline for selected scales (CGI‑S, ABC‑CFXS, ADAMS) were performed using Student’s t‑tests.

Twenty‑three male participants (13 adolescents, 10 adults) were randomized: 8 to OV101 5 mg QD, 8 to 5 mg BID, and 7 to 5 mg TID. The cohort exhibited severe neurobehavioral impairment, with mean Stanford‑Binet‑5 Full Scale IQ 41.5 (SD 3.29) and verbal IQ 44.5 (SD 3.23); 82.6% met DSM‑5 criteria for autism spectrum disorder. One participant in each dose group discontinued early: two due to withdrawn consent (QD and TID) and one due to a TEAE of agitation (BID). Mean exposure duration to OV101 was approximately 73–77 days across regimens, and mean treatment compliance was 95.4%, with 21 of 22 evaluable participants meeting the ≥80% compliance threshold.

OV101 was generally well tolerated across all three regimens. Sixteen of 23 participants (69.6%) experienced at least one TEAE (QD 28.6%, BID 100%, TID 75%). The most common TEAEs, occurring in ≥2 participants overall, were upper respiratory tract infection (17.4%), headache (13.0%), diarrhea (8.7%), and irritability (8.7%). All TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity, and most were mild. Eight participants (34.8%) had at least one TEAE considered possibly or probably related to study drug, with the highest number of treatment‑related TEAEs observed in the 5 mg BID group. No SAEs or deaths occurred, and no withdrawals related to serious toxicity were reported. Clinical laboratory values, vital signs, physical examination findings, and ECG measures showed no clinically meaningful trends or differences among dose groups.

In terms of efficacy, clinician‑rated CGI‑I at week 12 indicated that 60% of OV101‑treated participants were responders (CGI‑I ≤3), including 40% rated as ""much improved"" and 20% as ""minimally improved."" The responder rate was highest in the 5 mg BID group (71.5%), followed by QD (66.6%) and TID (42.9%). CGI‑S total score demonstrated a statistically significant mean reduction (−0.4 points, p<0.01) from baseline to week 12, with significant improvements in subdomains related to communication and connectedness, anxiety, ADHD symptoms, and activities of daily living.

Caregiver‑rated outcomes also suggested behavioral improvements. The ABC‑CFXS total score improved by approximately 26% from baseline (p<0.01), with significant reductions in lethargy/social withdrawal (38%), hyperactivity (29%), stereotypic behavior (21%), and irritability (20%) subscales. Similar patterns were seen when using the original ABC‑C scoring. ADAMS total score decreased significantly (−0.7 points, p<0.01), with notable improvements in general anxiety, social avoidance, and manic/hyperactive subscales. Other secondary measures such as RBS‑R, Short Sensory Profile‑2, and Conners 3 did not show consistent or clinically meaningful changes. Exploratory PGI‑I ratings indicated modest caregiver‑perceived global improvement in 55% of participants, with the highest rate again in the 5 mg BID group (71.4%). The most frequently endorsed top caregiver concerns centered on anxiety, disruptive behaviors, and daily living skills. No clear effect of age group (adolescent vs adult) was observed on behavioral outcomes.

The trial has important limitations. It lacked a placebo control arm, which is critical in FXS studies where large placebo responses on behavioral scales are well documented and in some cases similar in magnitude to drug effects. The sample size was small overall (n=23) and per treatment arm, limiting the precision of safety estimates and the ability to compare dose regimens or conduct subgroup analyses. Only males with FMR1 full mutation and moderate‑to‑severe impairment were included, so results may not generalize to females or to individuals with milder phenotypes or mosaicism. Objective biomarkers of target engagement and neural function were not incorporated, which would be valuable for reducing reliance on subjective caregiver‑reported outcomes.

Overall, this phase 2a study demonstrates that OV101 at 5 mg QD, BID, or TID is generally safe and well tolerated in adolescent and adult males with FXS and provides an initial signal of behavioral efficacy across multiple clinician‑ and caregiver‑rated domains, particularly at the BID dose. Given the absence of an approved targeted therapy for FXS and the limitations of this small, uncontrolled study, these findings support further investigation of OV101 in larger, randomized, placebo‑controlled trials, with careful selection of outcome measures, incorporation of objective biomarkers, and consideration of optimal dosing and patient subgroups.",,,,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,True,False,True,False,False,False
