GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,TP,TP,"This is a Phase 1/2, randomized, placebo-controlled, and observer-blind study in healthy Japanese adults.

The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccine candidate against COVID-19:

* As 2 doses, separated by 21 days
* At a single dose level
* In adults 20 to 85 years of age","This is an interim analysis of an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT04588480) evaluating the safety and immune response of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in healthy Japanese adults aged 20–85 years. Participants were randomized 3:1 to receive two intramuscular injections of 30 µg BNT162b2 or saline placebo 21 days apart. The study found that most local and systemic reactions were mild to moderate and transient, severe adverse events were uncommon, and no serious adverse events occurred. One month after the second dose, robust SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses were observed in both younger (20–64 years) and older (65–85 years) adults, although titers were somewhat lower in older participants.",True,0.93,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,FP,"From protocol amendment 3, this study is transitioned from a clinical trial to a postmarketing study (Phase 4) according to the Japanese regulation, because BNT162b2 was approved by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare on 14 February 2021.","This randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind phase 1/2 study (NCT04588480) was conducted at two sites in Japan to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in healthy Japanese adults aged 20–85 years, including those with stable preexisting disease. BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine encoding the prefusion-stabilized full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Participants with prior COVID-19, significant immunocompromise, certain viral infections (HBV, HCV, HIV), severe vaccine-related allergy, or prior coronavirus vaccination were excluded.

A total of 160 Japanese participants were randomized 3:1 to receive two intramuscular injections of 30 µg BNT162b2 (n=119) or saline placebo (n=41) administered 21 days apart. Participants were stratified by age: 20–64 years (n=130) and 65–85 years (n=30). More than 97% of BNT162b2 recipients received both doses. Safety assessments included solicited local reactions and systemic events within 7 days after each dose (collected via electronic diary), unsolicited adverse events (AEs) from dose 1 through 1 month after dose 2, serious adverse events (SAEs) through 1 month after dose 2 in this interim report, and hematology/chemistry laboratory parameters in the first 24 participants.

The most common local reaction after BNT162b2 was injection site pain, predominantly mild to moderate, with a median duration of 1–3.5 days; four vaccine recipients reported severe injection site pain. Placebo recipients reported only mild injection site pain in one case. Frequent systemic events included fatigue, headache, and chills, generally mild to moderate, transient (median 1–2 days), and more common in the younger age group. Severe systemic events were uncommon. After dose 1, one participant (25-year-old woman) reported severe headache, chills, fatigue, and joint pain, all considered vaccine-related; these resolved within 1–6 days, and she did not receive dose 2. After dose 2, small proportions of vaccine recipients reported severe fatigue, headache, chills, or joint pain. No grade 4 local or systemic events were observed. Fever >40 °C did not occur, and only one participant had fever >38.9 °C. Analgesic/antipyretic use was more frequent in vaccine than placebo recipients.

From dose 1 through 1 month after dose 2, any AEs were reported by 10.1% of BNT162b2 and 7.3% of placebo recipients. Common AEs (in more than one participant) were nasopharyngitis and headache. There were no immediate AEs within 30 minutes of vaccination, no SAEs, no life-threatening AEs, no deaths, no reported lymphadenopathy, and no COVID-19 diagnoses in this period. Two AEs were assessed as related to BNT162b2: the cluster of severe reactogenicity symptoms in the 25-year-old woman (leading to discontinuation of vaccination) and a case of moderate erythema multiforme in a 74-year-old woman that appeared two days after dose 2, confirmed by skin biopsy and resolving in 27 days with topical and oral therapy. In the 24-participant laboratory subset, transient mild lymphopenia occurred in some BNT162b2 recipients after dose 1 and resolved within a week; no laboratory abnormalities were reported as AEs.

Immunogenicity was evaluated using a SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralization assay employing an mNeonGreen reporter virus based on the USA_WA1/2020 strain. Sera were collected before doses 1 and 2 and at multiple time points up to 1 month after dose 2. In both age strata, neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs) rose substantially by 7 days post–dose 2 and remained elevated at 1 month. One month after dose 2, 50% neutralization GMTs were 571 in the 20–64-year group and 366 in the 65–85-year group, corresponding to geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) from baseline of 55.8 and 36.6, respectively. As seen in global trials, older adults showed lower GMTs than younger adults, but responses remained robust. Neutralization GMTs at 7 days after dose 2 in this Japanese cohort were comparable to those in the global trial (18–55 and 65–85 years).

The study was descriptive and not powered for formal hypothesis testing or efficacy evaluation. Efficacy endpoints against clinical COVID-19 were not assessed; however, cases of COVID-19, if any, are being collected for analysis after study completion. Longer-term immunogenicity at 6 and 12 months is planned but not yet available in this interim report. Overall, the findings show that two doses of 30 µg BNT162b2 given 21 days apart have an acceptable safety profile and induce strong neutralizing antibody responses in healthy Japanese adults, supporting the use of BNT162b2 for prevention of COVID-19 in this population.",False,0.22,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
