Yet, ACEs often go undetected in primary care settings during well-child visits due to unclear policies and tested implementation strategies. This pilot study will use mapping methodology, guided by the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation and Sustainment (EPIS) framework, to refine a multi-faceted strategy supporting the implementation of the state of California's 2020 policy promoting universal ACE screening in community clinics, and a stepped-wedge trial to test the impact of the strategy on implementation and child-level outcomes.","This study tests a multifaceted implementation strategy to improve screening for adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) pediatric clinics serving low‑income families in Southern California. The strategy supports California’s ACEs Aware Medicaid policy, which reimburses clinics for annual ACE screening at well‑child visits. Using a hybrid type 2, stepped‑wedge cluster randomized trial across five primary care clinics, the study will evaluate whether co‑created implementation supports (short video trainings, an implementation coach, a technology‑based screening algorithm, and written protocols) increase fidelity to the ACE screening protocol and the reach of screening among children ages 0–5. It will also assess the impact on child mental health referrals and psychosocial symptom outcomes, as well as the feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability of the approach within a large FQHC system.",True,0.86,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are defined as traumatic events occurring before age 18, such as maltreatment, life-threatening accident, harsh migration experiences or exposure to violence. ACEs are pervasive, with 45% experiencing at least one ACE and 10% experiencing three or more ACEs, placing them at high risk for negative life outcomes. ACEs are more prevalent among minority and immigrant communities due to exposure to poverty, discrimination, community violence, national disasters, and refugee experiences. ACEs screenings have potential value in identifying children experiencing toxic stress and the physical and mental health conditions associated with it such as asthma, Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) and anxiety. Yet, they are seldom used in primary care during well-child visits. The Surgeon General of the state of California have addressed this care gap by issuing an ACEs screening policy. Starting January 2020, MediCal, California's Medicaid health care program, will reimburse primary care settings ($29) for using the Pediatric ACEs and Related Life-events Screener (PEARLS) tool to screen children for ACEs during wellness visits. Despite significant investment in California and nationwide, evidence of the public health value of universal child screening policies is unclear. Increased screening efforts often do not translate into higher access to care for children and may even exacerbate disparities by increasing stigma and reinforcing a deficit view of marginalized groups. These results have been attributed to a lack of rigorous studies testing implementation strategies suited for pediatric screening policies. This mixed-method study will fill this gap by refining and testing an implementation strategy using a multi-site controlled trial within a Federally Qualified Health Center in Southern California. \[Update 05/2024\] Using the EPIS framework, we will employ a hybrid (type 2), controlled trial using a stepped-wedge design (n=5 clinics; 3 in the study and 2 clinics already implementing ACEs and used as comparison sites) to test the central hypothesis that clinics employing a multifaceted implementation strategy will have higher fidelity and reach of the ACEs screening policy. The partner FQHC system experienced financial strain during the COVID-19 pandemic and several of the randomly selected clinics closed prior to randomization.Selection of replacement clinics was based on clinic capacity to participate in the trial. Secondary hypothesis: impact of the ACEs policy on child mental health service and symptom outcomes. Aims are: 1. Refine a multifaceted implementation strategy to support the implementation of the ACEs screening policy in community-based clinics, and 2. Pilot test the feasibility, acceptability, fidelity and reach of the implementation strategy and the impact of the ACEs policy on child patient-level outcomes. This project capitalizes on a rare opportunity to pilot test an implementation strategy to maximize the impact of a state-wide policy intended to improve child health in under-resourced settings.","This protocol describes a hybrid effectiveness‑implementation (type 2) study designed to support and evaluate the implementation of California’s ACEs Aware policy in a large Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) system serving predominantly low‑income, racial and ethnic minority families. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are common, particularly in marginalized communities, and are associated with toxic stress and a wide range of adverse mental and physical health outcomes across the lifespan. In California, a statewide policy provides Medicaid reimbursement for ACE screening using the PEARLS tool in pediatric primary care, but policy alone has not consistently led to effective screening, referrals, or improved access to care.

The study’s overall objective is to co‑create, refine, and test a tailored, multicomponent implementation strategy that enhances FQHC capacity to integrate universal ACE screening into routine pediatric care for children ages 0–5 years. The strategy is developed using Implementation Mapping, guided by the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework, and involves extensive stakeholder engagement, including FQHC leadership and staff, a Trauma Informed Care workgroup, and caregivers.

The implementation strategy includes: (1) brief online video trainings for clinic personnel on ACEs, trauma‑informed administration of caregiver‑reported screening tools, and clinic workflows; (2) technical implementation support through an FQHC‑based implementation coach and an interprofessional Trauma Informed Care workgroup; (3) incorporation of the Pediatric Symptoms Checklist (PSC) to assess child psychosocial functioning, complementing the state‑mandated PEARLS ACE exposure screener and ACE‑associated health conditions checklist; and (4) a technology‑based screening algorithm hosted in a secure REDCap application, running on tablets, that combines PEARLS scores, ACE‑associated health conditions, and PSC scores to generate child risk categories (low, intermediate, high) and recommended follow‑up actions. The algorithm is pre‑tested and refined with FQHC champions and then beta‑tested in a non‑trial clinic.

Aim 1 focuses on refining the implementation strategy and ACE algorithm using a participatory Implementation Mapping process. Workgroup meetings with FQHC staff and separate groups with caregivers are conducted in English and Spanish to identify barriers, facilitators, preferred workflows, and enhancements to the caregiver experience during ACE screening. Outputs include a detailed implementation protocol and logic model that specifies implementation objectives, determinants, strategies, and hypothesized mechanisms of action.

Aim 2 is a pilot stepped‑wedge cluster randomized pragmatic trial across five FQHC clinics. Clinics transition from control (standard care, including any existing ACEs Aware protocol use) to intervention (standard care plus the multifaceted implementation strategy) at different 10‑week time points, over six 10‑week periods (total 15 months). Approximately 900–1,770 well‑child visits for children 0–5 years are expected across the trial. Control periods include usual developmental and behavioral screening, clinician discussions, and any state ACE protocol activities the clinic has already adopted (PEARLS, ACE‑related health conditions checklist, wellness exam, and education). In intervention periods, the formal implementation supports are added.

Caregivers of eligible children (0–5 years, English or Spanish speaking, primary decision‑maker) complete PEARLS and PSC instruments via tablet during well‑child visits, after informed consent. The ACE algorithm automatically scores the instruments and classifies risk: low risk (no ACEs and low PSC), intermediate risk (1–3 ACEs, no ACE‑associated physical condition, low PSC), or high risk (e.g., 4+ ACEs and ACE‑associated condition and elevated PSC, or combinations indicating high psychosocial risk). Risk categories and suggested follow‑up actions are communicated to the primary care provider, who uses this information for family education, clinical decision‑making, mental health referral, and documentation for reimbursement.

Primary implementation outcomes at the clinic level are: (1) reach—the proportion of eligible children who complete ACE screening; and (2) fidelity to ACE screening protocols, assessed via observation checklists conducted by the implementation coach. A key clinical outcome at the clinic level is the rate of child mental health referrals (e.g., to behavioral health, social work, developmental services) among eligible children, especially those at high risk. Secondary outcomes include feasibility and acceptability of the ACE policy and implementation strategy, measured using brief validated scales administered to clinic personnel.

Child‑level clinical outcomes include changes in psychosocial functioning as measured by PSC scores before and after screening among children identified at high or intermediate risk. Additional quantitative measures include child socio‑demographic characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, preferred language, birth in the USA) and clinic context variables. Implementation leadership and implementation climate within clinics are measured using validated scales to explore whether they mediate the relationship between the implementation strategy and outcomes such as feasibility, acceptability, fidelity, and reach.

Quantitative data sources include the FQHC electronic medical record (EMR) system (e.g., screening completion, ACE‑associated health conditions, referrals, socio‑demographics), REDCap screening data, staff surveys, and fidelity checklists. Statistical analyses use generalized linear mixed models appropriate for stepped‑wedge cluster randomized trials, with random effects for clinics and fixed effects for time and intervention status. Analyses adjust for child sociodemographic variables and consider potential confounding by secular trends over calendar time. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses (including multiple imputation for missing data) are planned. The study is powered primarily to detect differences in screening reach between intervention and control periods.

Qualitative data are collected via semi‑structured interviews with caregivers who participated in ACE screening and with clinic personnel involved in implementation. Interviews explore perceptions of the ACE policy and screening process, trauma‑informed care considerations, inner and outer context barriers and facilitators, workflow challenges, financial implications, and suggestions for improving the implementation strategy. Transcripts are analyzed using a framework‑informed, largely deductive coding approach based on EPIS and Implementation Mapping constructs, with thematic analysis supported by double coding and assessment of inter‑rater reliability.

The study aims to demonstrate how a co‑created, tailored implementation strategy can increase the fidelity and reach of ACE screening, improve mental health referral patterns, and potentially improve psychosocial outcomes among young children in safety‑net primary care settings. It also seeks to generate knowledge about how implementation leadership, climate, and technology‑enabled workflows can support policy‑driven innovations in complex, resource‑constrained healthcare systems. Findings will inform potential scale‑up within the partner FQHC system and dissemination to other FQHCs and policy stakeholders, including the California Office of the Surgeon General and the ACEs Aware initiative.",True,0.93,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
