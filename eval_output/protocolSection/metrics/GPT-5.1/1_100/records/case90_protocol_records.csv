Participants aged 18 and older with a current mental health diagnosis were randomized 2:1 to either MoST-MH or enhanced usual care (eUC). MoST-MH delivered periodic text message check-ins about emotional health and, when needed, web-based check-ins assessing stressors, negative impacts, and self-efficacy, followed by tailored self-care support messages and links to psychoeducational videos. Both groups received access to the same video library and completed monthly self-report measures for 3 months. The main aims were to assess engagement and usability of MoST-MH and to explore its effects on mental health self-efficacy, symptom severity, and mental health service use.

GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"To enhance outcomes for transition-age youth with mental health disorders during the vulnerable period that occurs during their first several months of college, the investigators propose an automated TM intervention, ""Text to Connect"" (T2C), that aims to increase mental health self-efficacy through psychoeducation, self-monitoring of symptoms and stressors, and cues to action for college-bound youth.

Assignment of Interventions:

The study will utilize block randomization whereby 2/3 of participants will be randomly assigned to receive T2C, and 1/3 to receive PE. Blocks will balance the groups on site (CCP versus STAR/CABS). A 2:1 randomization scheme will randomize 50 youth to either receive T2C (n=30) or a link to brief psychoeducational videos about mental health (PE; n=20). All participants will then complete a brief battery of self-report assessments online at baseline and again monthly through month 4. Youth randomized to receive PE will receive a text message with the link to the webpage with the psychoeducational videos. Youth randomized to receive T2C will be onboarded and initiate the TM intervention that sends automated prompts at minimum monthly through month 4.

Hypothesis:

Aim 1. To examine the feasibility of T2C for transition-age youth with psychiatric disorders (n=3 clinics, 50 adolescents). Youth randomized to receive T2C will:

Hypothesis 1a. engage with T2C at high rates (\>70% response rate to SMS prompts).

Hypothesis 1b. report high levels of satisfaction (\>70% satisfaction) and usability with T2C.

Aim 2. To examine the impact of T2C versus PE on mental health self-efficacy, symptoms and functioning, and treatment engagement. Over 4 months, youth who receive T2C, as compared with youth who receive PE, will report:

Hypothesis 2a (Primary). Greater mental health self-efficacy Hypothesis 2b (Secondary). Lower symptom severity and greater psychosocial functioning Hypothesis 2c (Secondary). Higher rates of follow-through with mental health services","This study was a pilot randomized controlled trial testing the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of the Mobile Support Tool for Mental Health (MoST-MH) in young adults transitioning to college who had current mental health disorders or recent mental health care. The transition to college is a period of heightened academic, financial, and interpersonal stress, often coinciding with transitions from pediatric to adult health services and barriers to accessing in-person mental health care. Digital mental health interventions can help, but many existing tools target single disorders, require human support, and have low long-term engagement.

MoST-MH is a fully automated, transdiagnostic ecological momentary intervention designed by a multidisciplinary team with input from a college student ambassador. It primarily uses SMS text messaging, supplemented by brief web-based check-ins, to provide tailored support for mental health self-management. After randomization, participants in the MoST-MH arm initiated the program by texting a keyword to a study number. Over 3 months, they received periodic text-based mental health check-ins asking them to rate their emotional health over the past week. If they reported ""excellent,"" ""very good,"" or ""good"" emotional health, they received positive feedback and a link to a psychoeducational video library focused on mental health and college life. If they reported ""fair"" or ""poor"" emotional health, they were sent a link to a web-based check-in.

The web-based check-ins presented a checklist of common stressors (for example, school or finances) and negative effects (such as feeling worn out or low motivation) and asked a self-efficacy question about the participant's confidence in managing these stressors and their impacts. If self-efficacy was rated as high, participants received encouraging feedback and a link to the video library, and the system stepped down to a lower check-in frequency (about monthly). If self-efficacy was rated as low, MoST-MH provided skills-based support messages grounded in positive psychology, cognitive behavioral therapy, and dialectical behavior therapy, plus links to the video library. It also asked permission to check in again the following week. Over time, the system compared current and previous reports of stressors and negative impacts, tailoring feedback around improvements or ongoing difficulties. If poor mental health and low self-efficacy were reported for two consecutive weeks, MoST-MH encouraged participants to seek formal mental health care and provided resource links.

Participants in the control arm (enhanced usual care, eUC) received access to the same psychoeducational video library but did not receive any text message or web-based mental health check-ins. All participants, regardless of arm, were asked to complete monthly web-based assessments for 3 months, including the Mental Health Self-Efficacy Scale (MHSES), the College Counseling Center Assessment of Psychological Symptoms (CCAPS) measuring multiple symptom domains (depression, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, academic distress, eating concerns, family distress, hostility, and substance use), and the Client Service Receipt Inventory for Mental Health (C-SRI) to capture mental health service utilization. At 3 months, MoST-MH participants also completed the Post-Study System Usability Scale (PSSUQ). Assessments were completed on personal devices, with reminder texts to promote completion. Participants could earn up to US$100 for completing the assessment batteries; there was no payment for interacting with the MoST-MH system itself.

The trial enrolled 52 participants (mean age ≥18 years) from a primary care clinic and a mental health clinic. Most participants were female and White, and most planned to attend a 4-year college with varied living situations. Randomization was stratified by recruitment site with a 2:1 allocation to MoST-MH (n=34) versus eUC (n=18). Investigators and outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation. Follow-up completion was high, with 94% completing 1-month, 90% 2-month, and 87% 3-month assessments. Because more White participants and those planning to live on campus were in the MoST-MH arm, models controlled for sex, race, and college living plans. Analyses used generalized estimating equations for repeated measures and included both completer analyses and sensitivity intention-to-treat analyses with multiple imputation.

Engagement with MoST-MH was high over the 3-month period. Participants received a median of 5 text check-in prompts (range 3–10) and responded to 100% of these queries. Among the 21 participants who ever reported poor emotional health, the system sent a median of 2 web-based check-in prompts (range 1–8); 78% (43/55) of these web check-ins were completed. No participant withdrew from the program via the ""Quit"" command. The median number of stressors per check-in was 2 and the median number of negative effects was 3. The most commonly reported stressors involved school and finances, and frequent negative effects included feeling worn out and low motivation. Self-efficacy for managing stressors and their impact was low in the majority of episodes (91%), and lower baseline generalized anxiety scores were associated with higher self-efficacy. Demographic factors were not significantly associated with engagement or self-efficacy.

Usability of MoST-MH was rated as high. The mean overall PSSUQ score at 3 months was 2.0 (on a 1–7 scale, with lower scores indicating better usability). Subscale scores were similarly favorable for system usefulness, information quality, and interface quality. Usability ratings did not vary significantly by sex, race, college living situation, or baseline mental health scores.

For clinical outcomes, the investigators examined trajectories of mental health self-efficacy and symptom severity. Mental health self-efficacy scores on the MHSES did not significantly change over time in either arm, and there were no significant time-by-treatment interactions. In contrast, CCAPS symptom scores showed broader reductions in the MoST-MH arm than in eUC, particularly for depression. In MoST-MH participants, symptom severity declined over 3 months across all subscales except substance use, whereas eUC participants showed reductions in generalized anxiety, family distress, and hostility only. GEE models indicated a significant overall time effect for depression at 1 month and a significant time-by-treatment interaction at 3 months, with MoST-MH associated with lower depression scores than eUC (effect size d≈0.36). However, in sensitivity analyses using multiple imputation for missing CCAPS data, treatment effects were no longer statistically significant, consistent with the pilot nature and limited power of the study.

Use of formal mental health services was common at baseline and remained relatively stable across both arms, with a slight decline over time. Before enrollment, more than half of participants in each arm had received some form of mental health care. During the 3-month follow-up, about half of participants in each group reported receiving mental health services in any given month. There were no significant differences between MoST-MH and eUC in overall service utilization or in specific modalities (outpatient, inpatient, or primary care for mental health).

The authors concluded that MoST-MH is a feasible, highly usable, and engaging intervention that may help reduce depressive symptoms in college-bound young adults with pre-existing mental health conditions. Its fully automated, transdiagnostic design and reliance on widely available SMS and web technologies suggest strong potential for scalable implementation. Key limitations include the small, predominantly female and White sample; the short 3-month follow-up; conduct during the COVID-19 pandemic with atypical college experiences; and lack of diagnostic and treatment subtype details. The study was not powered to detect definitive differences in clinical outcomes, and mechanisms of effect (such as changes in self-efficacy or help-seeking behavior) remain unclear. The authors recommend larger, more diverse trials with longer follow-up to further test the effectiveness, mechanisms, and implementation potential of MoST-MH.",True,0.9,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
