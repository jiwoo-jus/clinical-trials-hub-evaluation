GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,TP,TP,"Reinforcement learning is an advanced analytic method that discovers each individual's pattern of responsiveness by observing their actions and then implements a personalized strategy to optimize individuals' behaviors using trial and error. The goal of this pilot study is to develop and test a novel reinforcement learning-enhanced text messaging program to support medication adherence in patients with type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is an optimal condition in which to test this program, as it is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions in the US adult population and requires most patients to be on daily or twice daily doses of medications. This pilot study will be a parallel randomized pragmatic trial comparing medication adherence and clinical outcomes for adults aged 18-84 with type 2 diabetes who are prescribed 1-3 daily oral medications for this disease. Participants will be randomized to one of two arms for the duration of the study period: (1) a reinforcement learning intervention arm with up to daily, tailored text messages based on time-varying treatment-response patterns; or (2) a control arm with up to daily, un-tailored text messages. Our outcomes of interest will be medication adherence, as measured by electronic pill bottles, and HbA1c levels.","This randomized clinical trial, called REINFORCE, is testing whether a personalized text messaging program based on reinforcement learning can improve how regularly adults with type 2 diabetes take their oral diabetes medications. Sixty patients with suboptimal diabetes control are randomly assigned either to receive electronic pill bottles plus tailored text messages that adapt over time to their daily adherence patterns, or to receive electronic pill bottles without these messages. The main goal is to see if the reinforcement learning text messaging program increases average medication adherence over 6 months. The study also examines whether this approach improves blood sugar control, measured by HbA1c, and self‑reported adherence, and explores how such a system could be scaled to support other long‑term self‑management behaviors.",True,0.96,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False

Our outcomes of interest will be medication adherence, as measured by electronic pill bottles, and HbA1c levels.","The REinforcement learning to Improve Non-adherence For diabetes treatments by Optimising Response and Customising Engagement (REINFORCE) trial is a two-arm pragmatic randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the impact of a reinforcement learning–based text messaging intervention on medication adherence among adults with type 2 diabetes.

The study is conducted at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), Boston, USA, within the Mass General Brigham system. Eligible participants are 18–84 years old with diagnosed type 2 diabetes, prescribed 1–3 daily oral diabetes medications, and with a most recent HbA1c ≥7.5%, indicating suboptimal glycemic control. Participants must have a smartphone with data or home Wi‑Fi and ability to receive text messages, be able to use electronic pill bottles in place of their usual pill containers, have basic English proficiency, and be independently responsible for taking their medications. Patients using insulin are eligible, but prior documented non-adherence is not required.

After screening through the electronic health record and clinician approval, potentially eligible patients are invited by mail or electronic portal and then contacted by phone. Consented participants complete a baseline questionnaire via REDCap and are mailed Pillsy electronic pill bottles for their eligible oral diabetes medications. Adherence data are passively transmitted through a background smartphone app.

Participants are randomized 1:1 to the intervention or control arm, with block randomization based on baseline self-reported adherence (<1 vs ≥1 doses missed in the last 30 days) and baseline HbA1c (<9.0% vs ≥9.0%). All patients use electronic pill bottles for 6 months. The primary outcome is average medication adherence over the 6-month follow-up, calculated by averaging daily adherence (number of valid bottle openings divided by prescribed daily doses, capped at one opening per ~3 hours to avoid overcounting) across all study medications. Secondary outcomes include change in glycemic control (HbA1c) using routine EHR laboratory data near the 6‑month endpoint, and self-reported adherence at follow-up using a validated three-item scale.

The intervention arm receives a reinforcement learning–driven text messaging program designed to support medication-taking. Beginning the morning after randomization, a machine learning system (Microsoft Personalizer hosted on a HIPAA-compliant Microsoft Azure server) selects which message content is most likely to promote that patient’s medication-taking that day, based on prior daily adherence data from the pill bottles and patient characteristics (e.g., age, sex, number of medications, baseline HbA1c, and patient activation). Adherence from the prior day is treated as a continuous reward (0–1) for the algorithm, which applies a contextual bandit approach with Boltzmann sampling. The model also incorporates the recency of different message factor types and whether the patient took their dose “early” (before that morning’s prediction) and maintains some exploration (10% of daily predictions are random) to continue learning. If bottle data are temporarily unavailable, messages are generated from available history; reward events are withheld when bottles are obviously disconnected and assigned a default reward of 0 if still missing after 2 days.

The text messages are grounded in behavioral science and vary along five factor dimensions: (1) framing (neutral, positive, negative), (2) observed feedback (e.g., number of days adherent in the prior week), (3) social reinforcement (including references to loved ones), (4) content type (simple reminder vs information about medications or lifestyle), and (5) reflection (messages that prompt introspection or a reflective question). A library of 128 messages comprising 47 unique combinations of these factors was developed using prior trial experience, behavioral theory, and qualitative patient interviews. The reinforcement learning system chooses among these factor sets (and specific messages within them) and can also decide not to send a message on a given day. Messages are sent up to daily via Microsoft Dynamics 365 SMS Texting, a HIPAA-compliant platform. Two-way texting is technically possible, including allowing patients to stop reminders, but responses are not encouraged to preserve scalability.

In addition to algorithm-selected messages, intervention participants receive a standard introductory text at randomization, periodic texts prompting synchronization if their pill bottles are disconnected for over 7 days (repeated every 3 days up to 30 days), and an end-of-study text with a link to the follow-up questionnaire. If synchronization gaps exceed 14 and 28 days, study staff make one phone call at each time point. Control participants receive the same introductory, synchronization, and end-of-study texts and support calls but do not receive any reinforcement learning–driven adherence messages.

The primary analysis will use an intention-to-treat approach. Adherence and HbA1c outcomes will be modeled using generalized estimating equations with an identity link and normally distributed errors, adjusting for the block randomization. Missing HbA1c data (anticipated up to ~25%) will be addressed with multiple imputation if more than 10% of values are missing, with complete case analyses as a secondary approach. Self-reported adherence (proportion adherent) will be analyzed using Poisson models with a log link to estimate relative risks. Sensitivity analyses will include censoring participants who stop using their pill bottles for more than 30 days, assessing change in HbA1c from baseline, and examining each self-report adherence item separately. Planned subgroup analyses stratify by age, sex, race/ethnicity, baseline HbA1c, baseline self-reported adherence, and number of diabetes medications.

The sample size of 60 participants provides 80% power (α=0.05) to detect an absolute 10% difference in average adherence (assuming SD=12.5%), an HbA1c difference of 1.0% (assuming SD=1.3), and a 50% relative difference in self-reported adherence between arms.

Upon trial completion, exploratory analyses will cluster intervention participants based on their response patterns to different message factor combinations. Baseline characteristics and additional post-hoc message features (e.g., quantitative content, explicit reference to the doctor, lifestyle content) will be used to predict cluster membership, with the aim of informing more accurate initial personalization strategies for future interventions.

The trial is approved by the Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04473326). Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and reporting to ClinicalTrials.gov and the funder. The overarching hypothesis is that a reinforcement learning–based, individually tailored text messaging program will improve medication adherence and glycemic control in type 2 diabetes compared with control, and that the approach will be scalable and adaptable to other self-management behaviors.",True,0.93,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
