All patients first received 3 cycles of ibrutinib alone followed by 12 cycles of ibrutinib plus venetoclax. Patients who achieved very deep remissions, measured as undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) in both blood and bone marrow on at least two occasions, were randomly assigned to continue ibrutinib or switch to placebo, to see if they could remain disease‑free without ongoing active treatment. Patients without confirmed uMRD were randomly assigned to continue ibrutinib alone or ibrutinib plus venetoclax. The main goal was to compare 1‑year disease‑free survival after randomization in patients with confirmed uMRD who received placebo versus ibrutinib.

GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,EV,EV,,"CAPTIVATE (NCT02910583) is a multicenter, international, randomized phase II study evaluating a time‑limited, MRD‑guided treatment strategy with combined ibrutinib and venetoclax as first‑line therapy in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). The study focuses on whether patients achieving deep remissions characterized by undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) can discontinue active treatment while maintaining durable disease control.

Eligible patients were 18 to <70 years old with previously untreated CLL or SLL requiring therapy per iwCLL criteria, measurable nodal disease, ECOG performance status 0–1, and adequate organ function. The trial included an MRD cohort (reported here) and a separate fixed‑duration cohort. All patients in the MRD cohort began with a prerandomization phase consisting of three 28‑day cycles of single‑agent oral ibrutinib 420 mg once daily, followed by 12 cycles of combined ibrutinib plus venetoclax. Venetoclax was escalated over 5 weeks to a target dose of 400 mg once daily, with tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) prophylaxis and monitoring per venetoclax prescribing information. TLS risk stratification and, when indicated, hospitalization for TLS monitoring were implemented, and ibrutinib lead‑in was specifically used for tumor debulking and TLS risk reduction.

After completing three cycles of ibrutinib lead‑in and 12 cycles of combination ibrutinib plus venetoclax, patients received one additional cycle of combination therapy during which MRD status was confirmed and response was assessed. MRD was measured in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) by flow cytometry. Confirmed uMRD was defined as <1 CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes (10^-4) in both PB and BM, documented on at least two assessments ≥3 months apart. Patients meeting this stringent Confirmed uMRD definition were randomized 1:1, stratified by IGHV mutation status, to double‑blind treatment with placebo or continued ibrutinib. In these arms, study drug was continued until MRD relapse (defined as ≥1 CLL cell per 100 leukocytes on two assessments) or clinical disease progression. Patients who did not meet Confirmed uMRD criteria (uMRD Not Confirmed population) were randomized 1:1 to open‑label ibrutinib alone or ibrutinib plus venetoclax, with venetoclax allowed for a maximum of 2 years overall, until progression or unacceptable toxicity.

The primary endpoint was the 1‑year disease‑free survival (DFS) rate among patients with Confirmed uMRD randomized to placebo versus ibrutinib. DFS was defined as the absence of MRD relapse, clinical progression, or death at least 1 year after randomization. Secondary endpoints included uMRD rates in PB and BM, overall response rate and complete response (including CR with incomplete marrow recovery) per 2008 iwCLL criteria, duration of response, progression‑free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), TLS risk category reduction after ibrutinib lead‑in, pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib and venetoclax in combination, and safety/tolerability.

A total of 164 patients initiated ibrutinib lead‑in. This was a relatively young and high‑risk cohort, with a median age of 58 years and substantial frequencies of adverse prognostic features such as del(17p), del(11q), TP53 mutation, complex karyotype, and unmutated IGHV. After 12 cycles of ibrutinib plus venetoclax, best uMRD rates were 75% in PB and 68% in BM. Among 149 patients eligible for randomization, 86 achieved Confirmed uMRD and were randomized to placebo (n=43) or ibrutinib (n=43); 63 patients with uMRD Not Confirmed were randomized to ibrutinib (n=31) or ibrutinib plus venetoclax (n=32).

At a median follow‑up of 31.3 months (approximately 16.6 months after randomization), the primary endpoint showed no statistically significant difference in 1‑year DFS between placebo (95%) and ibrutinib (100%) in the Confirmed uMRD group (arm difference 4.7%, 95% CI −1.6 to 10.9; P=0.15). There were three DFS events in the placebo arm (two clinical progressions and one MRD relapse) and none in the ibrutinib arm. The estimated 30‑month PFS rates from first dose of study treatment were 95% with placebo and 100% with ibrutinib. At 12 cycles after randomization, most patients in both arms maintained uMRD: 84% in PB and 81% in BM with placebo, and 77% in both PB and BM with ibrutinib, suggesting durable MRD negativity in many patients even after stopping active treatment.

In the uMRD Not Confirmed population, estimated 30‑month PFS rates were also high: 95% with ibrutinib and 97% with ibrutinib plus venetoclax. Extended treatment improved response depth: about half of patients with a partial response prerandomization converted to complete response or CRi in both ibrutinib and ibrutinib plus venetoclax arms. uMRD rates in PB and BM either remained stable or improved, particularly with continued combination therapy (PB uMRD increasing from 50% to 69% and BM uMRD from 31% to 66% with ibrutinib plus venetoclax).

Ibrutinib lead‑in resulted in substantial debulking and TLS risk mitigation. Among 40 patients categorized as high TLS risk at baseline, 90% shifted to medium or low risk after the 3‑cycle ibrutinib lead‑in, and only 2% of the entire cohort remained high risk before starting venetoclax. This translated into a reduction in the proportion of patients requiring hospitalization for TLS monitoring from 47% at baseline to 18% after lead‑in. No clinical TLS events occurred; one case of laboratory TLS in a low‑risk patient resolved spontaneously without dose modification or hospitalization.

The safety profile of ibrutinib plus venetoclax was consistent with the known toxicities of each agent, without new safety signals. During the prerandomization phase, the most common treatment‑emergent adverse events were diarrhea, nausea, and neutropenia, with most diarrhea and all nausea being grade 1–2. The most frequent grade 3–4 events were neutropenia, hypertension, thrombocytopenia, and diarrhea. Serious adverse events occurred in about one‑fifth of patients; atrial fibrillation and major hemorrhage were infrequent, and grade ≥3 infections and febrile neutropenia occurred in a minority. Adverse events led to dose reductions of ibrutinib and venetoclax in a subset of patients, and discontinuations of either agent were relatively uncommon prerandomization. After randomization, the prevalence of adverse events of any grade and grade ≥3 events generally decreased over time in all arms, with the lowest rates observed in patients receiving placebo after achieving Confirmed uMRD. Continued ibrutinib plus venetoclax in the uMRD Not Confirmed group was associated with a higher prevalence of grade ≥3 events, neutropenia, and diarrhea than ibrutinib alone, necessitating a balance between deeper responses and increased toxicity.

Pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that coadministration of venetoclax did not meaningfully change ibrutinib exposure, and venetoclax exposure with ibrutinib was within the range of previously studied doses. No clear association was found between drug exposure and adverse events.

Overall, this study demonstrates that a finite course of ibrutinib plus venetoclax can induce high rates of deep MRD‑negative remissions in previously untreated, fit patients with CLL/SLL, including those with high‑risk genomic features. In patients achieving stringent Confirmed uMRD after 12 cycles of combination therapy, discontinuation of active treatment and transition to placebo resulted in high 1‑year DFS and PFS rates comparable to those observed with continued ibrutinib, supporting the feasibility of MRD‑guided fixed‑duration therapy. The combination also significantly reduces TLS risk before venetoclax initiation through ibrutinib‑mediated tumor debulking. These findings provide a rationale for time‑limited, all‑oral, chemotherapy‑free combination therapy with ibrutinib and venetoclax in first‑line CLL/SLL, and inform ongoing phase III trials comparing fixed‑duration approaches with continuous BTK inhibitor therapy.",,,,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,True,False,True,False,False,False
