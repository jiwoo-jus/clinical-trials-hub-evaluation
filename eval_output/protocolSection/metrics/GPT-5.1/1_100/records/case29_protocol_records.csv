Following surgery and anthracycline-based chemotherapy, participants will receive either trastuzumab emtansine at a dose of 3.6 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) and pertuzumab at a dose of 420 milligrams (mg) intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (q3w) or trastuzumab at a dose of 6 mg/kg and pertuzumab at a dose of 420 mg IV q3w in combination with a taxane.","This phase III randomized, multinational KAITLIN study evaluated whether replacing standard taxane plus trastuzumab (with pertuzumab) with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) plus pertuzumab, after anthracycline-based chemotherapy and surgery, could improve outcomes and reduce toxicity in adults with high-risk HER2-positive early breast cancer. High risk was defined as node-positive disease or node-negative, hormone receptor–negative tumors larger than 2 cm. Patients were randomly assigned to receive anthracycline-based chemotherapy followed by either taxane plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab (AC-THP) or T-DM1 plus pertuzumab (AC-KP) for about one year. The main outcome was invasive disease-free survival, assessed first in node-positive patients and then in the overall population. The study found no significant improvement in invasive disease-free survival with T-DM1 plus pertuzumab compared with taxane plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, although both regimens achieved high 3-year invasive disease-free survival rates. Overall safety profiles were consistent with prior experience, and quality-of-life deterioration during HER2-targeted therapy was less frequent with T-DM1 plus pertuzumab, largely due to avoidance of taxane-related toxicity.",True,0.96,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,EV,EV,,"KAITLIN (NCT01966471) is a phase III, randomized, open-label, multinational clinical trial conducted in 288 centers across 36 countries to investigate adjuvant treatment strategies for high-risk HER2-positive early breast cancer (EBC). Eligible patients were adults with newly diagnosed, operable, nonmetastatic, histologically confirmed HER2-positive invasive breast carcinoma that had been surgically excised. High risk was defined as either (1) lymph node–positive disease (pN ≥ 1), with any tumor size except T0 and any hormone receptor status, or (2) node-negative disease (pN0) with tumor size > 2.0 cm and hormone receptor–negative status (estrogen receptor– and progesterone receptor–negative). HER2 positivity was centrally confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC 3+) and/or in situ hybridization (HER2:chromosome 17 ratio ≥ 2.0).

Within 9 weeks after definitive breast surgery, patients were randomized 1:1 to one of two adjuvant treatment arms, both beginning with anthracycline-based chemotherapy (three or four cycles of investigator’s choice of FEC, AC, or EC). After completion of anthracycline therapy and an interval of at least 3 weeks, patients received HER2-targeted therapy for a planned duration of one year, in combination with either a taxane or trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1):

• Control arm (AC-THP): anthracycline chemotherapy followed by a taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel) plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Trastuzumab was given every 3 weeks (8 mg/kg loading, then 6 mg/kg), and pertuzumab every 3 weeks (840 mg loading, then 420 mg). After completion of the taxane phase, trastuzumab plus pertuzumab was continued to complete at least one year of HER2-targeted therapy.

• Experimental arm (AC-KP): anthracycline chemotherapy followed by T-DM1 plus pertuzumab. T-DM1 was administered at 3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks, with pertuzumab dosed as in the control arm, for a total planned duration of at least one year of HER2-targeted therapy.

Dose delays and reductions were permitted for anthracyclines, taxanes, and T-DM1; only delays (no reductions) were allowed for trastuzumab and pertuzumab. For patients in the T-DM1 arm who discontinued T-DM1 due to toxicity, a switch to trastuzumab was recommended to complete at least one year of HER2-directed therapy. Adjuvant radiotherapy and/or endocrine therapy was administered as clinically indicated, typically after taxane chemotherapy in the control arm or after four cycles of T-DM1 in the experimental arm.

The coprimary efficacy endpoints were invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) in the intention-to-treat node-positive population and in the overall randomized population. IDFS was defined as time from randomization to first occurrence of ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence, ipsilateral locoregional invasive breast cancer recurrence, contralateral or ipsilateral second primary invasive breast cancer, distant recurrence, or death from any cause. Secondary endpoints included IDFS plus second primary nonbreast cancer, disease-free survival (including ductal carcinoma in situ events), distant recurrence-free interval, and overall survival (OS). Adverse events were assessed using CTCAE v4.0. Cardiac endpoints included adjudicated primary cardiac events (severe heart failure, significant LVEF decline, or cardiac death) and secondary cardiac events (symptomatic or asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction with LVEF decline). Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 questionnaires, focusing on global health status/quality of life, functioning, and symptoms, with clinically meaningful deterioration generally defined as a ≥ 10-point decrease from baseline.

The statistical design targeted approximately 171 IDFS events in the overall population and 160 in the node-positive subpopulation to provide ~80–82.5% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.64 at a two-sided 5% significance level using a stratified log-rank test. A hierarchical testing procedure controlled the overall type I error at 5%: IDFS in node-positive patients, then IDFS in the overall population, followed by OS in node-positive patients and OS in the overall population. After results from the metastatic MARIANNE trial indicated noninferiority but not superiority of T-DM1-based regimens versus taxane plus trastuzumab, the planned sample size in KAITLIN was reduced from 2,500 to approximately 1,850 patients without altering the event-driven power assumptions.

Between January 2014 and June 2015, 1,846 patients were enrolled (918 AC-THP; 928 AC-KP); 1,658 (89.8%) were node-positive. Median follow-up was about 57 months in both arms. There were 82 (9.9%) IDFS events in the AC-THP arm and 80 (9.6%) in the AC-KP arm among node-positive patients, yielding a stratified HR of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.71–1.32; P = .83). Because the primary comparison in node-positive patients was not statistically significant, hierarchical testing was stopped. In the overall population, 88 (9.6%) and 86 (9.3%) IDFS events occurred in the AC-THP and AC-KP arms, respectively (stratified HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.72–1.32). Three-year IDFS rates in the overall population were 94.2% (95% CI, 92.7–95.8) for AC-THP and 93.1% (95% CI, 91.4–94.7) for AC-KP, with similar patterns in node-positive patients. Secondary endpoints, including disease-free survival and distant recurrence-free interval, were also comparable between arms. OS data were immature at the time of analysis, with low event rates (3.6% vs 4.7% in AC-THP vs AC-KP).

In the safety population (1,838 treated patients), completion of all 18 cycles of trastuzumab or T-DM1 occurred in 88.4% of AC-THP patients and 65.0% of AC-KP patients; when including those who switched from T-DM1 to trastuzumab, 81.5% in AC-KP completed planned HER2-directed therapy. Grade 3 or higher adverse events and serious adverse events occurred at similar rates across arms (approximately 55% vs 52% for grade ≥ 3 events and 23% vs 21% for serious adverse events in AC-THP vs AC-KP). Discontinuation of T-DM1 was notably higher than for trastuzumab (26.8% vs 4.0%), mainly because of laboratory abnormalities such as elevated bilirubin and thrombocytopenia. Overall cardiac event rates were low in both arms, with slightly fewer primary and secondary cardiac events in the T-DM1 arm. T-DM1 was associated with increased rates of hepatotoxicity, thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhage compared to the taxane–trastuzumab regimen, while taxane-related toxicities (e.g., neuropathy, myalgia, arthralgia, and alopecia) are acknowledged but detailed incidence values are not fully reported in the extract.

PRO analyses showed that during the anthracycline phase, patients in both arms experienced deterioration in quality of life and functioning. From the start of HER2-targeted therapy, functioning stabilized in the AC-KP arm but continued to worsen in the AC-THP arm during taxane administration, then improved after taxane completion, ultimately converging with AC-KP. Time-to-event analyses demonstrated a 29% reduction in risk of clinically meaningful deterioration in global health status/quality of life from the start of HER2-targeted therapy in the AC-KP arm compared with AC-THP (stratified HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.62–0.80), with similar patterns for physical and role functioning.

Overall, KAITLIN did not demonstrate superiority of adjuvant anthracycline followed by T-DM1 plus pertuzumab over anthracycline followed by taxane plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab in terms of IDFS in high-risk HER2-positive early breast cancer. Both regimens achieved high IDFS rates and had safety profiles consistent with previous experience. The trial supports the continued use of taxane plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab–based chemotherapy as the standard adjuvant regimen in this setting. In the context of evolving treatment paradigms, where neoadjuvant trastuzumab/pertuzumab plus chemotherapy followed by adjuvant T-DM1 for residual disease is now standard, these results reinforce a tailored strategy that maintains intensive HER2-targeted therapy while exploring chemotherapy de-escalation in selected patients and therapy escalation (including T-DM1) for those with residual high-risk disease.",,,,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,True,False,True,False,False,False
