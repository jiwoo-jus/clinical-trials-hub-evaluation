The primary objectives of the study are to characterize the incidence of treatment emergent sinus bradycardia, treatment emergent sinus tachycardia, or other treatment emergent cardiac arrhythmias after administration of sugammadex and to evaluate the general safety of sugammadex in a population of ASA Class 3 and 4 participants in a surgical setting.","This randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multi-site safety study evaluated whether sugammadex is safe and well tolerated for reversing moderate or deep neuromuscular block caused by rocuronium or vecuronium in higher‑risk surgical patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Class 3 or 4. Participants were randomized to receive sugammadex at 2, 4, or 16 mg/kg (16 mg/kg for rocuronium only) or neostigmine plus glycopyrrolate for reversal of neuromuscular block. The main focus was on treatment-emergent cardiac rhythm changes, including sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, and other arrhythmias, as well as other adverse events of clinical interest, to determine if sugammadex has a favorable cardiac and overall safety profile compared with neostigmine/glycopyrrolate in this medically vulnerable population.",True,0.96,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,EV,EV,,"This trial was a randomized, active comparator-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind safety study conducted at 27 sites in four countries between December 2017 and September 2019 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03346057). It enrolled adult men and women (≥18 years, BMI <40 kg/m²) scheduled for surgical procedures requiring moderate or deep neuromuscular block with rocuronium or vecuronium who were classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Class 3 (severe systemic disease) or 4 (severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life).

Participants were stratified by ASA class (3 vs 4) and by neuromuscular blocking agent (rocuronium vs vecuronium), then randomized via an interactive voice response system to one of several maintenance/reversal combinations. Within the rocuronium stratum, patients were assigned in a 2:1:2:2 ratio to: (1) moderate neuromuscular block with reversal using sugammadex 2 mg/kg; (2) moderate neuromuscular block with reversal using neostigmine (50 µg/kg, up to 5 mg) plus glycopyrrolate (10 µg/kg, up to 1 mg); (3) deep neuromuscular block with reversal using sugammadex 4 mg/kg; or (4) deep neuromuscular block with reversal using sugammadex 16 mg/kg (the dose indicated for urgent reversal of high-dose rocuronium). Within the vecuronium stratum, patients were randomized in a 2:1:2 ratio to moderate block with sugammadex 2 mg/kg, moderate block with neostigmine/glycopyrrolate, or deep block with sugammadex 4 mg/kg. Vecuronium was not paired with the 16 mg/kg sugammadex dose because that dose is only indicated for high-dose rocuronium.

Anesthesiologists were blinded to the reversal agent in the moderate block arms and to the sugammadex dose in the deep block arms; a separate safety assessor was blinded to all treatment assignments, depth of block, and drug preparation. Neuromuscular block was maintained per local practice, targeting train-of-four (TOF) counts of 1–3 for moderate block and post-tetanic count <5 for deep block. Reversal was given as an intravenous bolus (in two masked syringes) within 5 minutes after TOF count reappeared at 1–4 (moderate block) or when post-tetanic count was ≥1 with TOF count 0 (deep block).

The primary safety endpoints were the incidences of treatment-emergent (TE) sinus bradycardia, TE sinus tachycardia, and other TE cardiac arrhythmias occurring from just before through 35 minutes after administration of the reversal agent. Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring began at least 5 minutes before and continued for at least 30 minutes after study drug administration. Sinus bradycardia was defined as heart rate <60/min or a >20% decrease from baseline; sinus tachycardia as heart rate ≥100/min or a >20% increase from baseline; and other arrhythmias as new or worsened rhythm disturbances (e.g., atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation). Events had to be sustained for at least 1 minute to be counted.

Pre-specified events of clinical interest (ECIs) included clinically relevant (CR) arrhythmias (sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, or other arrhythmias requiring intervention), potential hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis (adjudicated by an external blinded committee), and drug-induced liver injury defined by protocol-specified liver function test thresholds. Additional safety assessments included general adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), laboratory parameters (including liver tests and creatinine clearance), and vital signs up to 7 days post-treatment, with supplemental AE follow-up through 14 days.

The All Participants as Treated population comprised 331 treated patients (61% male, mean BMI 28.5 kg/m², mean age 69 years; 67% ≥65 years; approximately 75% ASA Class 3 and 25% ASA Class 4). Rocuronium was used in 231 and vecuronium in 100 participants.

TE cardiac rhythm events were infrequent. Compared with neostigmine/glycopyrrolate, sugammadex 2 mg/kg was associated with a significantly lower incidence of TE sinus bradycardia. Sugammadex 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg were both associated with significantly lower incidences of TE sinus tachycardia than neostigmine/glycopyrrolate. No statistically significant differences were observed between sugammadex groups and neostigmine/glycopyrrolate for other TE cardiac arrhythmias. These findings were generally consistent across ASA class (3 vs 4) and neuromuscular blocking agent (rocuronium vs vecuronium) strata.

Clinically relevant arrhythmias and other ECIs were rare in all treatment arms. No cases of adjudicated hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis and no cases of drug-induced liver injury occurred. Liver enzyme and bilirubin elevations were uncommon and similar across groups. No participants developed creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min up to 14 days post-treatment, and no clinically meaningful effects on vital signs were attributed to sugammadex.

Overall adverse event and serious adverse event rates up to 7 days were similar among treatments, with no meaningful imbalances in drug-related AEs. Two deaths occurred in patients who received sugammadex (one each in the 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg groups); investigators judged both to be unrelated to study medication. One serious drug-related AE (cardiac arrest) occurred in the 16 mg/kg sugammadex group and resolved.

The study concluded that in ASA Class 3 and 4 surgical patients, sugammadex demonstrates a favorable safety and tolerability profile, including cardiac safety, for reversal of moderate and deep rocuronium- or vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block. The incidences of TE sinus bradycardia and sinus tachycardia were lower with sugammadex at labeled doses than with neostigmine/glycopyrrolate, and there were no excess risks identified for other arrhythmias, hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, or hepatic injury. These data support the use of sugammadex in higher-risk surgical populations.",,,,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,True,False,True,False,False,False
