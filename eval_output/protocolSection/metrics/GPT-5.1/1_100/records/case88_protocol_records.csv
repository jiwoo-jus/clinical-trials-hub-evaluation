The patient mobile app has articles about cardiovascular disease and other health related topics, patient-reported outcomes surveys, physical activity tracking, reminders for medications and upcoming appointments, and two-way communication with a Wellframe Health Advocate. The Wellframe Health Advocate encourages patients to achieve their health goals and stay engaged in their health. The feasibility of onboarding patients to the app and the clinical efficacy of the platform will be evaluated.","This open-label, single-arm pilot trial evaluated a customized smartphone application with live, non-clinician health coaches for patients hospitalized for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to symptomatic coronary artery disease, including myocardial infarction. The app provided education, medication and activity tracking, reminders, and messaging with health coaches during the first 90 days after discharge. Investigators compared participants (enrolled 2018–2019) to propensity-matched historical controls (2015–2017) from the same health system to assess feasibility, short‑term safety (30- and 90-day readmissions), and effectiveness in improving cardiac rehabilitation (CR) enrollment and early outpatient cardiology follow-up.

GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,EV,EV,,"This study was an open-label, single-arm, multicenter clinical trial conducted at two academic hospitals (Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital) within a single health system. The trial evaluated the feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of a smartphone app-based digital health platform for patients hospitalized for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD), including acute myocardial infarction (MI) and non-MI CAD.

Patients aged initially 21–70 years (later expanded to 21–85 years) who spoke English, owned a smartphone or tablet, and had undergone PCI were approached for enrollment between February 2018 and May 2019. Exclusions included recent substance or alcohol abuse, in-hospital acute MI, pregnancy, dementia or cognitive delay, and incarceration. The intervention consisted of onboarding patients to a customized mobile health platform (Wellframe) at or shortly after hospital discharge. The app included a personalized daily health checklist, educational content, interactive surveys, medication and step tracking, goal-setting around physical activity, reminders, and secure messaging with third‑party (non‑clinician) health coaches, supported by a clinician-facing dashboard. Accounts remained active for 90 days. 

To evaluate the intervention, the investigators assembled a 1:3 propensity-matched historical control cohort from the same two hospitals (January 2015–December 2017). Historical controls met the same clinical eligibility criteria, except that smartphone/tablet ownership information was not available. Matching variables included age, sex, PCI indication (MI vs symptomatic non-MI CAD), diabetes mellitus type 2, primary care provider within the health system, insurance type, state of residence, and PCI site. Balance was checked with standardized mean differences. All outcomes for both intervention and control groups were adjudicated via manual chart review within the integrated electronic health record.

The primary safety endpoint was 30-day all-cause hospital readmission. Secondary safety and utilization endpoints included 90-day all-cause readmission and 30- and 90-day cardiovascular readmission. Effectiveness endpoints focused on processes of care: 90-day enrollment in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) at a health-system facility and 1‑month follow-up with a system cardiologist. Feasibility was measured by the proportion of eligible patients who enrolled and by multiple engagement metrics, such as content viewing, survey completion, self-reported physical activity goal completion, medication reminder use, and messaging patterns with health coaches.

A total of 1994 PCI patients were screened; 1026 were ineligible (most commonly due to having elective PCI after a prespecified cap, advanced age before inclusion criteria were expanded, or medical complexity). Of 968 eligible patients, 324 were approached and 118 (36.4%) consented and enrolled. Participants had a mean age of 62.5 years, 73.7% were male, 33.9% had type 2 diabetes, 57.6% underwent PCI for MI, and 50.0% had known CAD. Demographics and comorbidities were similar between the intervention group (n=118) and historical controls (n=343) after matching.

Engagement with the app was high and durable over 90 days. At 30 and 90 days, the majority of users opened at least half of the educational content, completed at least half of the surveys, and reported meeting physical activity goals on at least half of days. Weekly engagement—defined as having at least one day per week with any task completed—was 80.5% at 30 days and 66.9% at 90 days. Patients set up multiple daily medication reminders, and bidirectional messaging between participants and health coaches was robust, with strong correlation between messages sent by patients and messages sent by coaches. Importantly, engagement metrics showed no significant association with age, sex, PCI indication, or major cardiovascular risk factors, suggesting broadly similar uptake across demographic and clinical subgroups.

In terms of clinical and utilization outcomes, the app did not increase short-term readmissions. All-cause readmission rates at 30 and 90 days were similar between the intervention and historical control groups, as were cardiovascular-specific readmission rates. However, the intervention was associated with a substantially higher rate of 90-day CR enrollment at system facilities (approximately 30% vs 16% in controls), corresponding to roughly one additional CR enrollment for every eight app users. Among those who enrolled in CR, completion rates were numerically higher in the intervention group, though the difference did not reach statistical significance. The app group also had roughly double the rate of 1‑month cardiology follow-up within the health system compared with controls, without differences in the timing of the first follow-up visit when it occurred.

The investigators concluded that deploying a smartphone app with third-party health coaches at the time of hospital discharge after PCI is feasible, achieves high patient engagement across different demographic and risk-factor profiles, and appears safe with respect to short-term readmissions. The intervention successfully improved key care-transition processes, particularly CR enrollment and early outpatient cardiology follow-up. Limitations include its non-randomized design, reliance on a historical control cohort, modest sample size, short follow-up duration, and potential selection bias related to smartphone ownership and willingness to enroll. Larger, prospective, randomized controlled trials are recommended to determine whether such digital health interventions can improve long-term cardiovascular outcomes and to better understand their impact on health equity and the digital divide.",,,,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,True,False,True,False,False,False
