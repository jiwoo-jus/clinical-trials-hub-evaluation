GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,TP,TP,"HIV antiretroviral therapy has the potential to dramatically decrease HIV transmission worldwide1; yet, a barrier to ending the AIDS epidemic in low-resource settings is the fact that healthcare is largely provided by traditional or spiritual healers rather than biomedical providers, and there are no strategies in place to identify HIV-infected patients among Traditional Healer patients and link them to HIV care. In order to reach the UNAIDS 90-90-90 benchmarks HIV services must reach marginalized populations in endemic regions, such as in southwestern Uganda. Uganda is one of seven sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries accounting for 90% of all new HIV infections in this region6. HIV prevalence is 7.3%, with \~1.5 million people living with HIV/AIDS and 99,000 new infections in 2014. However, only 50% of sexually active Ugandans have ever tested for HIV8. In the project location of southwestern Uganda, like much of SSA, the majority of Ugandans utilize Traditional Healers (TH), but little is known about Traditional Healer practices or rates of HIV testing (or HIV infection) among their clients. Specific aims of this study are to: 1) identify key socio-structural factors that frame HIV testing behaviors among Ugandan adults who utilize Traditional Healers; 2) investigate acceptability of providing point-of-care HIV testing at Traditional Healer practice locations; and 3) develop and pilot a prospective HIV testing intervention among Traditional Healer patients to promote earlier diagnosis. Results will be used to implement subsequent, large-scale cluster-randomized HIV testing intervention at Traditional Healer practice locations. Findings from the proposed study include formative data on populations that utilize Traditional Healers in an HIV-endemic region of Uganda, and pilot testing of an HIV testing intervention at healer practice locations; these results could be applied towards expanding HIV testing in other low-resource, endemic settings.",This mixed-methods study evaluated whether traditional healers in rural southwestern Uganda can effectively increase HIV testing among adults with unknown HIV status. Traditional healers located within 8 km of the Mbarara District HIV clinic were cluster-randomized to either provide point-of-care oral swab HIV testing and counselling to their adult clients (intervention) or to refer clients to local clinics for HIV testing (control). Eligible clients were sexually active adults who had not been tested for HIV in the prior 12 months and had no known HIV diagnosis. The main outcome was whether clients received an HIV test within 90 days of enrolment. The study tested the hypothesis that HIV test uptake would be higher when tests were delivered directly by trusted traditional healers compared with referrals to clinic-based testing.,True,0.86,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
GPT-5.1,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"This study has three specific aims:

Specific Aim 1: Identify key socio-structural factors that frame HIV testing behaviors among clients of Ugandan TH, using an exploratory sequential, mixed-methods study design. First, qualitative interviews with 25-35 purposely-sampled TH clients will characterize the care-seeking trajectory, HIV testing behaviors and related stigma, healthcare costs, and HIV risks and exposures. Based on these results, a survey will be designed and administered to 300 Ugandan adults who utilize TH in Mbarara District. This cross-sectional study will identify 1) rates of HIV testing among TH clients and 2) variables that independently predict HIV testing within the prior 12 months. These data will inform a model of HIV testing behavior among TH clients based on the Andersen Model of Healthcare Utilization, and generate hypotheses to be tested in Specific Aim 2.

Specific Aim 2: Characterize acceptability of receiving point-of-care (POC) HIV testing at TH locations, using an exploratory sequential, mixed-methods approach. Qualitative interviews with 15-25 purposely sampled TH and 15-25 purposely-sampled TH clients will explore attitudes and experiences with biomedicine, feasibility and acceptability of delivering POC HIV testing at TH locations, and investigate relevant themes emerging from Aim 1. Based on qualitative results, a survey will be developed and administered to 175 TH in Mbarara District. This cross-sectional study will characterize TH practices relevant to HIV testing, and identify characteristics of healers who favorably view the proposed intervention (Specific Aim 3). These data will be integrated with results from SA1 to develop an intervention that will overcome socio-structural barriers to HIV testing.

Specific Aim 3: Develop and pilot an HIV testing intervention among TH clients using a cluster randomized study design. Integration of results from SA1 and SA2 will inform a pilot HIV testing intervention at 9 TH practice locations, to be compared with a control group receiving usual TH care at 8 practices. This pilot will offer HIV testing at TH practice sites to 250 TH clients at the intervention arm sites, and offer protocoled usual care to 250 clients at control arm sites. Primary outcome for this study will be rates of HIV testing among TH clients. Secondary outcomes will include i) number of new HIV diagnoses among TH clients, and ii) number of patients with +HIV POC test who successfully link to HIV care in 3 months.","This study was a parallel-arm, cluster-randomised trial with an embedded qualitative component conducted in Mbarara Township, a rural area in southwestern Uganda with HIV prevalence higher than the national average. The unit of randomisation was the traditional healer, reflecting concerns about cross-contamination if individual clients were randomised. Healers practise four main specialties in Uganda—herbalists, spiritual healers, traditional birth attendants, and bonesetters—and all specialties were eligible.

Traditional healers were eligible as clusters if they were at least 18 years old, located within 8 km of the Mbarara District HIV clinic, listed in a 2018 district-wide census of healers, and saw at least seven clients per week (excluding very low-volume practices). Using stratified randomisation by healer specialty, 17 healers were allocated 1:1 to intervention (n=9) or control (n=8) groups.

Client-level eligibility criteria included age 18 years or older; current receipt of care from a participating healer; history of sexual activity; self-reported absence of HIV testing in the prior 12 months; and no prior HIV diagnosis, consistent with Ugandan Ministry of Health guidance that individuals without testing in the past year are considered of unknown HIV serostatus. Healers screened clients, and research assistants confirmed eligibility and obtained written informed consent in the local language.

All participating healers first attended a common 1-day educational session on HIV transmission, symptoms, prevention, antiretroviral therapy (ART), and national HIV testing guidelines. Control-group healers then received an additional 1-day training focused on standardised referral procedures. They were instructed to provide HIV education and written referral letters (in English and Runyankole) directing eligible clients to nearby HIV testing facilities. Clients were advised to present for voluntary HIV testing within 90 days.

Intervention-group healers attended a separate 1-day training that covered pre- and post-test counselling, practical administration of oral swab OraQuick HIV tests, hygiene and sample collection techniques, interpretation of results, eligibility criteria, and study documentation. Research assistants provided individually wrapped OraQuick test kits for eligible enrolled clients. Healers offered point-of-care HIV testing on site; they recorded whether the test was accepted and the result using a simple graphical form not requiring literacy. For clients with reactive tests, healers provided information about confirmatory testing locations and linkage to HIV care. Research assistants collected documentation and disposed of test waste but did not view or verify test results to preserve confidentiality.

The primary outcome was receipt of an HIV test within 90 days of enrolment. In the control arm, this was assessed by self-report during a 90-day follow-up phone call; in the intervention arm, uptake and test results were documented contemporaneously by healers. Secondary outcomes included new HIV diagnoses and linkage to HIV care for those newly diagnosed, also assessed via self-report at 90 days. Newly positive clients were asked about confirmatory testing and ART initiation. Reasons for not testing were collected from control-group clients who remained untested at follow-up. Safety and adverse events were monitored based on prespecified criteria.

Sample size calculations assumed an intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.22 and an HIV testing rate of 39% in the control group, with a hypothesised absolute increase of 35 percentage points (to 74%) in the intervention group. With at least 16 clusters and roughly 30 clients per cluster (total ~480 clients), the study had 80% power at a two-sided alpha of 0.05. The target enrolment was 500 clients (250 per arm).

Between August 2019 and February 2020, 500 eligible clients of unknown HIV serostatus were enrolled (250 per group) across 17 healer clusters, with mean cluster size of 30 participants. At 90 days, follow-up was 99% in the intervention group and 100% in the control group. In the intervention group, 100% (250/250) of clients received an HIV test, versus 23% (57/250) in the control group, corresponding to a 77% absolute increase in uptake (95% CI 73–82; p<0.0001) and a roughly 4.4-fold higher likelihood of testing when accounting for clustering. The ICC was 0 in the intervention arm (no variability in testing uptake) and 0.28 in the control arm.

Among intervention clients, 10 of 250 (4%) had a new HIV diagnosis; no new cases were identified in the control group (p=0.0018). Of the ten newly diagnosed individuals, seven reported confirmatory HIV-positive results, linkage to HIV care, and ART initiation within 90 days. One did not seek care in that period, and two were lost to follow-up, leaving their linkage outcomes unknown. No adverse events or safety concerns were reported.

In the control group, 193 clients did not test within 90 days. The most commonly reported barriers were lack of time to attend clinic-based testing (78%) and insufficient funds for transportation (70%). Multivariate analysis among control clients revealed that higher HIV risk scores, being enrolled at bonesetter practices, and younger age were all associated with lower likelihood of undergoing clinic-based HIV testing.

After the trial, qualitative interviews were conducted with all 17 healers and 107 clients (67 control, 40 intervention). Content analysis showed that healer-delivered HIV testing was highly acceptable. Clients described traditional healers as trusted and more confidential than clinic staff, reducing anticipated stigma associated with HIV testing. Healers reported that OraQuick tests were easy to use and that they felt empowered to support their clients’ health. Control clients highlighted structural and psychosocial barriers—time, transport costs, mobility limitations due to injuries, and fear of a positive result—as reasons for avoiding facility-based testing, especially among those engaging in higher-risk behaviours.

The study demonstrates that traditional healers can effectively deliver point-of-care HIV testing, achieve very high uptake and meaningful linkage to care, and potentially transform their role in the HIV service cascade—from contributing to delayed diagnosis to becoming facilitators of early testing. Given the widespread presence of traditional healers in sub-Saharan Africa, this strategy may provide a scalable, community-based approach to reach populations with historically low engagement in HIV testing, including rural men, young adults, and individuals with high-risk sexual behaviours. The authors note the need for future work on cost-effectiveness, generalisability to lower-volume practices and other settings, and the influence of individual healer characteristics on intervention success.",True,0.86,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
