Both drugs are used to prevent uterine atony and postpartum haemorrhage, but while oxytocin is known to cause dose-dependent ST-depression, troponin release, QT-time prolongation and arrhythmia, little is known about the myocardial effects of carbetocin. The study hypothesizes that there may be differences in cardiac markers between the two drugs. Following a pilot study of 40 women that demonstrated reduced high-sensitivity troponin I changes with carbetocin compared to oxytocin, this larger trial will enroll 240 healthy singleton pregnant women aged 18-50 years at three Norwegian hospitals.

Claude-4.5-Sonnet,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"Background -Treatment Caesarean delivery is a commonly performed surgical procedure. Uterus contraction after delivery of the baby is necessary to avoid excessive bleeding.

Background - Therapeutic Information Adequate uterus contraction after delivery of the baby is necessary to avoid excessive bleeding. Prophylactic administration of an oxytocin receptor agonist is first line practice. Intravenous injection of oxytocin has been the standard procedure but serious cardiovascular adverse events have been reported. Lowering the dose or administering the drug as a 5 minute infusion may increase safety. Carbetocin, a synthetic oxytocin receptor agonist, has significantly longer half life and may reduce blood loss compared with oxytocin. The hemodynamic vasodilatory effects are comparable to oxytocin, but potential differences in adverse effects on myocardium are not well described yet.

Pre-Clinical \& Clinical Experience with Carbetocin (IMP) and Oxytocin Carbetocin has been in clinical use in EU for some years and the efficacy is documented in several RCTs. In the proposed study, carbetocin will be used within the conditions of the marketing authorization. Oxytocin is the first line treatment and prophylaxis in Norway and most countries in the world. According to recently published guidelines from EU drug authorities (EMA), oxytocin should be given as a slow, 5-minute infusion in order to avoid hypotension. This has so far not been implemented in Norway. The pre-clinical and clinical experience of the two drugs are summarized in the Summaries of Product Characteristics.

Rationale for the Study Pregnancy and delivery is a natural process, but for many women this period is stressful and not without risks of morbidity, and even mortality. Circulatory adverse events leading to death has been reported after intravenous injection of oxytocin. Some studies indicate that oxytocin may lead to dose dependent ischemic ECG changes, prolongation of QT time and liberation of biomarkers of myocardial cell death. Previously the investigators have demonstrated comparable vasodilatory effects of oxytocin and carbetocin. There is no clinical study comparing the specific myocardial effects of oxytocin with carbetocin. It may have great impact on the choice of standard medication if the cardiotoxicity of carbetocin is lower compared with oxytocin. The study of potential cardiotoxicity has to be performed in healthy women. Knowing that millions of laboring women have had uneventful injections of oxytocin and carbetocin after delivery, there is probably no reason to fear long lasting negative effects of either drug. If there are differences in cardiotoxicity, this new information should be taken into consideration when planning delivery in pregnant women with heart disease.

STUDY OBJECTIVES The aims of this study are to compare 0h (before C-section) plasma concentrations of Troponin I (high sensitive methods) with a second measurement of plasma concentration of Troponin I drawn within an interval of 6 to 10 hours after administration of study drug, in elective healthy C-section patients randomized to oxytocin 2.5 U or carbetocin 100 µg, 1 minute injection immediately after delivery.

Primary Endpoint Primary outcome measure is the difference in plasma concentration of Troponin I from baseline (0h) to the second measurement 6-10 hours after test drug administration, according to treatment allocation. Plasma concentrations will be collected before C-section, and at an interval of 6-10 h after test drug administration.

Secondary Endpoints

* Other myocardial biomarkers
* Uterus tone evaluated repeatedly
* Blood loss (estimated calculated blood loss)
* Postoperative pain and side effects.
* BP, heart rate and ECG changes","This is a parallel group, randomized, patient- and investigator-blinded Phase 4 study conducted at three obstetrics units at Oslo University Hospital (two clinics) and Akershus University Hospital in Norway. The study follows a pilot study (NCT02528136) that enrolled 40 women and demonstrated a reduction in changes in high sensitivity troponin I levels from baseline with carbetocin (0.41±0.79 ng/L) compared with oxytocin (1.78±4.48 ng/L) after elective cesarean delivery, with peak changes occurring 10 hours after drug administration. Participants will be healthy women with normal singleton pregnancies at gestational age of 36 weeks or more who are able to read and understand Norwegian. Women with common comorbid diagnoses such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypertension are included. Each participant will receive a one-minute intravenous injection of either oxytocin 2.5 IU or carbetocin 100 µg during caesarean delivery. The prespecified primary outcome is change from baseline in high-sensitive troponin I plasma concentrations at 6-10 hours after study drug administration, with baseline samples collected before caesarean delivery. All troponin I levels will be batch assessed and investigators will not have access to results until after the last patient completes the study. Secondary outcomes include uterine tone grade at 2.5 and five minutes after study drug administration, adverse events for up to 48 hours after study drug administration, estimated blood loss within eight hours of delivery, need for rescue treatment, and direct/indirect costs. The study is designed as a superiority trial powered to confirm findings of the previous pilot work. Primary analysis will be by modified intention to treat using independent student t-test followed by regression modeling. Additional prospective sub-analysis will be conducted on patients who did not receive rescue treatment for uterine atony. The rationale for this study is that women undergoing caesarean delivery should be assessed for cardiovascular risk, particularly as women with obstetric history of pregnancy-induced hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm birth, placental abruption, and stillbirth are at increased risk of future cardiovascular disease. Any additional ischemic myocardial risk from uterotonic agents needs to be balanced against the benefit of reducing postpartum hemorrhage risk. Enrollment started in April 2019 and was completed in February 2022, with primary analysis expected by end of 2021. The study is conducted according to Good Clinical Practice principles with origins in the Declaration of Helsinki and has approval from the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics and the Norwegian Medicines Agency.",True,0.97,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
