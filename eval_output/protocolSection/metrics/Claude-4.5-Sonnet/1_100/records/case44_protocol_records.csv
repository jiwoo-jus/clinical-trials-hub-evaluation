Claude-4.5-Sonnet,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,TP,TP,"Non-adherence to evidence-based prescription medications results in preventable morbidity and mortality for middle-aged and older adults. Taking medications intended for daily use, like those to prevent or treat chronic conditions, is a repetitive action that has great similarity with other behaviors that must be performed consistently, such as regular exercise, healthy eating, and hand washing. In these cases, people who act consistently do so out of habit. The ""repetition-cue-reward"" model proposes that habit formation has three central components: behavioral repetition, associated context cues, and rewards. This model has obvious applicability to the daily repetitive activity of medication-taking but has not been tested for this behavior nor adapted as an intervention for patients in real-world care settings.

The goal of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the repetition-cue-reward model of healthy habit formation to improve medication adherence in patients with arthritis and other rheumatic diseases.","Medication adherence for patients with chronic conditions such as gout, a debilitating form of arthritis that requires daily medication to prevent flares, is a costly problem. Existing interventions to improve medication adherence have only been moderately effective. Habit formation theory is a promising strategy to improve adherence. The cue-reward-repetition principle posits that habits are formed by repeatedly completing an activity after the same cue and having the action rewarded every time. Over time, cues become increasingly important whereas rewards become less salient because the action becomes automatic. This study tests whether leveraging the cue-reward-repetition principle could improve adherence to daily gout medications.",True,0.96,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False

The goal of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the repetition-cue-reward model of healthy habit formation to improve medication adherence in patients with arthritis and other rheumatic diseases.

This pilot study will be a 3-arm parallel randomized pragmatic trial comparing medication adherence for adults over 18 years old with arthritis, lupus, or gout who are prescribed 1-3 daily oral medications for this disease. Participants will be randomized to one of three arms for the duration of the study period. Patients in the first intervention arm will choose an event-based cue and receive daily reminder text messages reminding them of their cue. Patients in the second intervention arm will start by establishing their cue and having the donation made, but only those who show no improvement in adherence after 6 weeks will start receiving the text messages. In both interventions arms, a donation will be made to a local charity every time they take their medication. Patients in the control arm will not receive any intervention (but will receive pill bottles to monitor their adherence). Our outcomes of interest will be medication adherence, as measured by electronic pill bottles.","This is a three-arm parallel randomised controlled trial testing an adaptive intervention that leverages the repetition cue-reward principle. The trial began recruitment in August 2021 in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. Eligible patients are adults with gout who have been prescribed a daily oral medication for gout and whose most recent uric acid is above 6 mg/dL. Participants will be randomised to one of three arms and given electronic pill bottles. In the two intervention arms, participants will select a daily activity to link to their medication-taking (cue) and a charity to which money will be donated every time they take their medication (reward). Participants in Arm 1 will receive reminder texts about their cue and their charity reward amount will be $0.50 per day of medication taken. Arm 2 will be adaptive; participants will receive $0.25 per adherent-day and no reminder texts. If their adherence is <75% 6 weeks post-randomisation, their reward will increase to $0.50 per adherent-day and they will receive reminder texts. The control arm (Arm 3) will receive electronic pill bottles only without any intervention. The primary outcome is adherence to gout medications over 18 weeks. Secondary outcomes include habit formation through change in automaticity and sense of routine from baseline, as well as possible changes in intention or perceptions of gout medications. Exploratory outcomes include change in uric acid level from baseline.",True,0.94,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
