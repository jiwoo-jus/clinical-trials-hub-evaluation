Claude-4.5-Sonnet,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,TP,TP,The purpose of the current study is to evaluate whether there is immune interference when MenABCWY \[consisting of MenACWY lyophilized component and rMenB+OMV NZ (Bexsero) liquid component\] is administered to healthy adolescents and adults following a 2-dose vaccination schedule with MenABCWY administered 2 months apart.,"This phase 2, randomized, open-label study assessed the immunogenicity and safety of an investigational meningococcal ABCWY vaccine (MenABCWY) in healthy 10- to 25-year-old participants. The MenABCWY vaccine contains components of licensed vaccines against meningococcal serogroup B (4CMenB) and serogroups ACWY (MenACWY). A total of 500 participants were randomly assigned to one of five study groups: four groups received two doses 2 months apart of MenABCWY, 4CMenB plus MenACWY administered concomitantly in the same arm, 4CMenB plus MenACWY in different arms, or 4CMenB alone; a fifth group received a single MenACWY dose. The study was primarily designed to assess potential immunological interference between vaccine components against pooled serogroup B test strains. Results showed no evidence of substantial immunological interference between 4CMenB and MenACWY vaccine components against serogroup B, with acceptable safety and tolerability profiles for the investigational MenABCWY vaccine.",True,0.92,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
Claude-4.5-Sonnet,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,EV,EV,,"Neisseria meningitidis is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis and sepsis, with six meningococcal serogroups (A, B, C, W, X, and Y) accounting for most cases of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) worldwide. The quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine MenACWY-CRM (Menveo) provides protection against serogroups A, C, W, and Y, while the four-component meningococcal serogroup B vaccine 4CMenB (Bexsero) targets serogroup B. An investigational vaccine (MenABCWY) combining MenACWY and 4CMenB antigens is being developed to provide protection against five serogroups and simplify the vaccination schedule. Previous studies showed the MenABCWY vaccine was immunogenic with an acceptable safety profile, although immune responses against serogroup B test strains were overall higher in participants who received 4CMenB alone compared to those who received MenABCWY.

This phase 2 randomized study was conducted to assess if there is immune interference when two doses of the MenABCWY vaccine are administered 2 months apart. A total of 500 healthy 10- to 25-year-old participants were enrolled and randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to five study groups: MenABCWY (n=100), 4CMenB plus MenACWY administered concomitantly in the same arm (4CMenB+ACWY/S, n=104), 4CMenB plus MenACWY in different arms (4CMenB+ACWY/D, n=100), 4CMenB alone (n=94), or a single dose of MenACWY (n=102). The study was powered to assess immunological interference against pooled serogroup B test strains.

Immunogenicity was measured by serum bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA) against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y and serogroup B test strains representing major antigens (fHbp, NadA, PorA, NHBA). One month after the second vaccine dose, hSBA geometric mean titers (GMTs) against pooled serogroup B strains were 31.84, 38.48, 40.08, and 42.38 in the MenABCWY, 4CMenB+ACWY/S, 4CMenB+ACWY/D, and 4CMenB groups, respectively. The ratio of GMTs (4CMenB+ACWY/S versus 4CMenB+ACWY/D) was 0.96 (80% CI, 0.83 to 1.10), indicating no statistically significant difference and suggesting no substantial immunological interference when vaccines were administered in the same versus different arms. Immune responses against individual serogroup B test strains for PorA and NHBA antigens were lower in the MenABCWY group compared to the 4CMenB+ACWY/D and 4CMenB groups.

Safety and reactogenicity were assessed through solicited local and systemic adverse events (AEs) for 7 days post-vaccination and unsolicited AEs for 30 days post-vaccination. At least one solicited local AE was reported by 90.0-97.1% of participants after each dose in groups receiving two doses and 57.8% in the MenACWY group. The most frequent solicited local AE was pain at the injection site (87.0-96.2% after each dose). Solicited systemic AEs were reported by 62.5-71.0% of participants after each dose, with fatigue and headache being most common. Most solicited AEs were mild to moderate in severity. Unsolicited AEs were reported by 14.7-26.0% of participants during the 30-day follow-up period. Five serious AEs were reported in five participants, with one case of syncope considered related to vaccination. No deaths occurred during the study, and no safety concerns were identified.

In conclusion, administration of two doses of MenABCWY does not appear to be associated with substantial immunological interference for pooled serogroup B test strains. The MenABCWY vaccine had an acceptable reactogenicity and safety profile, supporting continued evaluation of this investigational vaccine.",,,,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,True,False,True,False,False,False
