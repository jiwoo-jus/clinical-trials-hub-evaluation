In this clinical trial combination the standard immunotherapeutic treatment; the programmed death 1 (PD-1) regulatory antibody Nivolumab and a peptide vaccine consisting of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) peptides will be tested in patients with metastatic melanoma. Patients will be treated with Nivolumab every second week as long as there is clinical benefit. The PD-L1/IDO peptide vaccine is given from start of Nivolumab and every second week for the first 6 vaccines and thereafter every fourth week up to 1 year.","This phase 1/2 clinical trial (MM1636) evaluated the safety, immunogenicity, and clinical efficacy of a first-in-class immune-modulatory vaccine targeting indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in combination with nivolumab in patients with metastatic melanoma. The vaccine (IO102/IO103) consists of peptides derived from IDO and PD-L1, administered with Montanide adjuvant. The hypothesis is that activating IDO- and PD-L1-specific T cells through vaccination can target immunosuppressive cells and tumor cells expressing these molecules, thereby modulating the tumor microenvironment to enhance responsiveness to anti-PD-1 therapy. Thirty anti-PD-1 therapy-naive patients with metastatic melanoma were treated with the vaccine combined with nivolumab.",True,0.93,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
Claude-4.5-Sonnet,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"Background:

Huge advances have been made in the treatment of metastatic melanoma (MM) the past 5 years. Especially immunotherapy has shown promising results.

Cancer cells are naturally attacked by cells of the immune system, but can induce a state of tolerance whereby they escape from immune attack. This escape is brought about by many mechanisms. An important one is the programmed death pathway (PD-1/PD-L1). PD-L1 is commonly overexpressed on cancer cells. Interaction of PD-1 on activated T cells and PD-L1 on cancer cells lead to inhibition of the cytotoxic T cells. Another important mechanism is through overexpression of the metabolic enzyme IDO on cancer cells. Activation of IDO also inhibits cytotoxic T cells.

Investigators have recently identified spontaneous T cell reactivity against PD-L1 and IDO in the tumor microenvironment and in the peripheral blood of patients with MM and healthy donors. Both IDO and PD-L1 reactive CD8 T cells are cytotoxic and can kill cancer cells and immune regulatory cells in vitro.. Thus boosting specific T cells that recognize immune regulatory proteins such as IDO and PD-L1 may directly modulate immune regulation.

Due to distinct mechanisms of action, the combination of treatment with a monoclonal antibody targeting PD-1 (Nivolumab) and a vaccine with peptides against PD-L1 and IDO may have a synergistic effect.

Investigators have previously reported a phase I trial where, the IDO peptide was tested in 15 patients with MM in combination with Ipilimumab, and no grade 3-4 toxicity was seen. The PD-L1 peptide is currently being tested in a first-in-man study in patients with multiple myeloma.

Methods:

A two-step clinical phase I/II trial design will be used, starting out with a pilot study including 6 patients with MM to test feasibility and tolerability. If the treatment is found feasible the study will be extended to a phase II study with 24 patients. The objective is to describe anti-tumor immune responses and objective responses using RECIST 1.1.

Patients will be treated with Nivolumab in accordance with standard regimen, which involves outpatient IV infusions every second week as long as there is clinical benefit. The PD-L1/IDO peptide vaccine is given from start of Nivolumab and every second week for the first 6 vaccines and thereafter every fourth week up to 1 year. 15 vaccines will be administered in total.

Patients will be followed with clinical controls and diagnostic imaging every 12 weeks. Patients who receive all vaccines will have follow up after 3 and 6 months in parallel with standard of care treatment for Nivolumab.","The MM1636 trial is an investigator-initiated, nonrandomized, open-label, single-center phase 1/2 study conducted at the Department of Oncology, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Denmark. The study aimed to assess the feasibility, safety, immunogenicity, and clinical efficacy of the IDO/PD-L1 peptide vaccine (IO102/IO103) combined with nivolumab in patients with metastatic melanoma.

The vaccine consists of two peptides: IO102 (a 21-amino-acid peptide from IDO) and IO103 (a 19-amino-acid peptide from the signal peptide of PD-L1), each at 100 µg, mixed with Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant. The vaccine was administered subcutaneously biweekly for the first six doses, then every 4 weeks, for a maximum of 15 vaccinations over approximately 9 months. Nivolumab was administered intravenously at 3 mg/kg biweekly for 24 cycles, followed by 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks as standard of care for responding patients, for up to 2 years.

The primary objective was to evaluate safety and feasibility. Secondary objectives included assessment of immunogenicity through detection of vaccine-specific T cell responses in peripheral blood and tumor biopsies, and evaluation of clinical efficacy measured by objective response rate (ORR), complete response rate (CRR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.

Patients eligible for enrollment were adults (≥18 years) with locally advanced or stage 4 melanoma (AJCC 7th edition), at least one measurable lesion, ECOG performance status 0-1, and no prior anti-PD-1 therapy. Main exclusion criteria included CNS metastases >1 cm, severe comorbidities, and active autoimmune disease.

The study enrolled 30 patients from December 2017 to June 2020. Blood samples for immunologic analyses were collected at baseline, during treatment (cycles 3, 6, 12, 18, 24), and 3 and 6 months post-vaccination. Tumor biopsies were obtained at baseline and after six cycles when accessible. Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin tests were performed after cycle 6 to evaluate skin-infiltrating lymphocytes reactive to the vaccine peptides.

Immunogenicity was assessed using interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays, flow cytometry for intracellular cytokine staining, and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing. Functional characterization of vaccine-specific T cells included assessment of cytolytic markers (CD107a), cytokine production (IFN-γ, TNF-α), and recognition of target cells expressing IDO and/or PD-L1.

Clinical efficacy was evaluated using FDG PET-CT scans at baseline and every 3 months until progression. Responses were categorized according to RECIST 1.1 by investigator review and validated by blinded independent external review. To address potential trial bias, patients were matched with a historical control group from the Danish Metastatic Melanoma Database (DAMMED) who received anti-PD-1 monotherapy contemporaneously, matched for age, sex, PD-L1 status, BRAF status, LDH level, and M stage.

Tumor microenvironment changes were assessed through immunohistochemistry (IHC) of paired biopsies for CD3, CD8, PD-L1, IDO, MHC-I, and MHC-II expression, and RNA gene expression profiling using the NanoString nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel.

The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice, monitored by the GCP unit in Copenhagen, and approved by the ethical committee of the Capital Region of Denmark, the Danish Medical Agencies, and the Capital Region of Denmark Data Unit. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03047928) and EudraCT (2016-0004527-23).",True,0.86,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
