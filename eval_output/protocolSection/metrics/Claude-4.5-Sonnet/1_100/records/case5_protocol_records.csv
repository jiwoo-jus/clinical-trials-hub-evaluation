Overall, 1515 participants were randomized 3:1 to receive either V114 or PCV13, followed by PPSV23.

Claude-4.5-Sonnet,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,EV,EV,,"Adults with certain medical conditions (chronic heart, liver, and lung disease, diabetes mellitus) and behavioral factors (smoking, alcoholism) are at increased risk for pneumococcal disease (PD) regardless of age. Sequential vaccination with 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) followed by 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) is recommended for at-risk adults in some countries to provide broader serotype coverage. V114 is a 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine that contains the 13 serotypes in PCV13 plus serotypes 22F and 33F, which have emerged as leading causes of invasive pneumococcal disease following the introduction of PCVs.

This study was conducted from July 2018 through July 2020 at 79 sites worldwide. Participants were randomized 3:1 to receive a single dose of V114 or PCV13 on Day 1, followed by a single dose of PPSV23 at Month 6. The study enrolled immunocompetent adults aged 18-49 years who were pneumococcal vaccine-naive, with or without risk factors for PD. The Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health enrolled Native American adults with and without risk factors; non-CAIH sites enrolled participants with at least one risk factor for PD. Approximately 75% of participants had at least one risk factor for PD at screening.

Safety assessments included solicited injection-site reactions and systemic adverse events, as well as serious adverse events. Immunogenicity was assessed by measuring serotype-specific opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies at baseline, 30 days post-PCV vaccination, pre-PPSV23 vaccination (Month 6), and 30 days post-PPSV23 vaccination (Month 7). The primary immunogenicity objective was to evaluate serotype-specific OPA geometric mean titers for the 15 serotypes included in V114 at Day 30.

Results showed that V114 and PCV13 were well tolerated, with comparable safety profiles. The most common solicited adverse events were injection-site pain and fatigue. Both vaccines were immunogenic for all serotypes contained in each respective vaccine. V114 induced robust immune responses against its unique serotypes 22F and 33F. Sequential administration of PPSV23 6 months after V114 or PCV13 was also well tolerated and immunogenic for all 15 serotypes, including 22F and 33F, maintaining immune responses for shared serotypes.",,,,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,True,False,True,False,False,False
