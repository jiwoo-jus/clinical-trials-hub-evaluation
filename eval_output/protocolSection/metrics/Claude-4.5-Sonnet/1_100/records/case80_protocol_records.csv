The study evaluated three combination regimens: avelumab with utomilumab and rituximab (arm A), avelumab with utomilumab and azacitidine (arm B), and avelumab with bendamustine and rituximab (arm C). The primary endpoints were dose-limiting toxicities and objective response rate. The study was designed to assess whether these combination therapies could augment and sustain the antitumor immunity of avelumab in relapsed/refractory DLBCL.",True,0.9,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
Claude-4.5-Sonnet,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"The target study population of this Phase 1b/3 registrational study is patients with R/R DLBCL who have completed at least 2 (but not more than 4) lines of prior rituximab-containing multi-agent chemotherapy, and/or in whom autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) has failed, or who are not candidates for ASCT or who are not eligible for intensive chemotherapy. Patients who are ineligible for intensive second line chemotherapy must have received at least one prior rituximab-containing combination chemotherapy regimen. The study will assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity of the 3 avelumab-based combination regimens tested, and collect patient reported outcome (PRO) data.","JAVELIN DLBCL (NCT02951156) was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, seamless two-component (phase Ib planned to be followed by phase III), parallel-arm study of avelumab in various combinations for the treatment of relapsed/refractory DLBCL. Based on preclinical and clinical data suggesting potential synergy between PD-L1 inhibition and various immunomodulatory agents, three combination regimens were investigated. Arm A combined avelumab with utomilumab (an IgG2 4-1BB agonist) and rituximab, based on evidence that 4-1BB agonism and PD-L1 antagonism may be synergistic and that anti-4-1BB agonist mAbs can enhance rituximab's anti-lymphoma activity. Arm B combined avelumab with utomilumab and azacitidine, based on evidence that epigenetic priming by azacitidine might sensitize cancer cells to PD-1/PD-L1 axis blockade. Arm C combined avelumab with bendamustine and rituximab, given that bendamustine and rituximab is recommended for relapsed/refractory DLBCL. Key eligibility criteria included histologically confirmed DLBCL in patients at least 18 years of age with relapsed/refractory disease following two or more and up to four lines of rituximab-based multiagent chemotherapy. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to the three treatment arms. Avelumab 10 mg/kg was administered intravenously every 2 weeks in all arms. Primary endpoints were dose-limiting toxicities and objective response assessed by investigator per Lugano Response Classification criteria. Secondary endpoints included PD-L1 expression, minimal residual disease, duration of response, time to tumor response, disease control, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. The study also included comprehensive biomarker analyses including cell of origin assessment, immunohistochemical analyses for PD-L1, CD4, CD8, CD68, and 4-1BB/CD137, and minimal residual disease assessment using serial blood samples. The phase Ib component was designed to determine the most active treatment regimen to advance to a planned phase III component; however, due to insufficient antitumor activity in arms A and B and infeasibility of expanding arm C, the study was discontinued before initiation of the phase III component.",True,0.86,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
