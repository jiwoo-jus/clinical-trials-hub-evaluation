Claude-4.5-Sonnet,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,TP,TP,"The mLab App combines HIV prevention information with push notifications/reminders to complete HIV testing and an automated image processing feature to provide real-time feedback on home-based HIV test results. Theoretically-guided by the Health Information Technology Usability Evaluation Model (Health-ITUEM), the proposed project will refine and test a next-generation diagnostic intervention delivered on a mobile platform to improve HIV testing and linkage-to-care outcomes among youth living with and at-risk for HIV. Given the pervasiveness, low cost, and convenience of mobile technology, the investigators hope that the App can help achieve the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy in the US by increasing the number of persons living with HIV who know their serostatus, decreasing HIV-related disparities, and ultimately reducing the risk of HIV transmission and acquisition.","The number of youth living with HIV in the United States continues to rise, and racial, ethnic, and sexual minority youth including young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and young transgender women (YTGW) bear a disproportionate burden of the HIV epidemic. Due to social and healthcare system factors, many YMSM and YTGW do not seek HIV testing services and are therefore less likely to be aware that they are infected. Mobile health technology (mHealth) has the ability to increase uptake of HIV testing among these populations. This study evaluates the mLab App, which combines HIV prevention information with a mobile phone imaging feature for interpreting at-home HIV test results, to improve testing rates and linkage to care among Black, Latino, and other YMSM and YTGW living in New York City and Chicago and their surrounding areas.",True,0.93,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
Claude-4.5-Sonnet,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"The number of youth living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to rise, and they are disproportionately represented at each stage of the care continuum. Most relevant to this study, it is estimated that less than half of HIV-infected youth in the United States (US) have been diagnosed with HIV, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related deaths among youth have increased over the past decade despite decreased death rates among all other age groups, pointing to the urgent need for increased testing among youth.

Black and Latino youth are at increased risk of poor HIV-related outcomes and have disparate testing rates as compared to White youth. Mobile Health (mHealth) technology is a powerful and relevant tool which represents a promising approach for improving outcomes among youth living with HIV. Youth are avid adopters and heavy users of smartphones and digital technologies, and these technologies offer opportunities to tailor interventions to developmental stages and personal needs. Importantly, these technologies are capable of delivering interventions in real-time and in ecologic settings. This creates an opportunity to remotely reach youth through mobile and connected health approaches to strengthen their HIV care continuum engagement and treatment outcomes. In response, the investigators have developed the mLab App, an innovative mobile and connected technology that combines HIV prevention information with push notifications/reminders to complete HIV testing and an automated image processing feature to provide accessible, objective, secure, and real-time feedback on home-based OraQuick (lateral flow assay) HIV test results. The mLab App also contains an innovative automated data collection and a results reporting feature. Findings from the investigators' preliminary work in New York City indicate that youth perceive the mLab App as useful, easy to use, and effective at improving health outcomes and intend to use the technology. Furthermore, preliminary work in Africa support the sensitivity and specificity of the imaging algorithm for interpreting lateral flow assay results.

The investigators will conduct a careful, iterative process of technology refinement based on input from end users, experts, and the youth advisory board. The investigators will then enroll 525 high-risk youth (age 18-29 years) in a 12-month randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess differences in HIV testing rates and linkage to care between three arms the intervention arm, the standard of care-HIV information control arm, and the HIV home test arm. Finally, the investigators will analyze paradata, defined as auxiliary data that capture details about the process of interaction with the technology, to understand the effect of user engagement of the mLab App on improving HIV testing rates and linkage to care. Interventions delivered through mHealth technology represent a promising approach for improving outcomes among youth.","This is a three-arm randomized controlled trial among YMSM and YTGW aged 18–29 years. Participants are randomized to either: (1) the mLab App intervention including HIV home test kits and standard of preventive care (Arm 1), (2) standard of preventive care only (Arm 2), or (3) HIV home test kits and standard of preventive care only (Arm 3). The mLab App is an FDA regulated investigational device (IDE #18348) that provides automated notification reminders to complete HIV testing every 3 months and includes an automated image processing feature where users can upload a photo of their completed OraQuick test to receive real-time test results. The app also contains an automated data collection and results reporting feature, which relays test results back to the research team and the study participant, triggering messages to encourage future repeat testing for those who receive a non-reactive test or linkage to confirmatory testing and treatment for those with a reactive test. The targeted enrollment is 525 participants (210, 210, and 105 in arms 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Participants complete study assessments at baseline as well as 6- and 12-month follow-ups via computer-assisted self-interviewing. The primary outcome is the proportion of participants who self-report being tested for HIV in the past 6 months. Secondary outcomes include linkage to care for those who test positive and validation of the automated image-processing algorithm against user self-report, study team assessment, and confirmatory testing results. mHealth technology used for HIV prevention is capable of delivering interventions in real-time, which creates an opportunity to remotely reach users across the country to strengthen their HIV care continuum engagement and treatment outcomes. Specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic, mHealth technology combined with at-home testing may prove to be essential in increasing HIV testing rates, especially among populations at high-risk or without regular access to HIV testing.",True,0.93,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
