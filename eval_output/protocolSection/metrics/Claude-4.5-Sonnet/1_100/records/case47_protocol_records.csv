Claude-4.5-Sonnet,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,TP,TP,"Participation in community activities allows children to meet friends, learns new skills, fosters independence, and paves the foundation for lifelong health. High rates of community participation restriction have been reported in children with developmental disabilities who are aged six years or below, a critical developmental period.

Occupational Performance Coaching (OPC), grounded in self-determination theory, is aimed to facilitate children's participation in life situations through coaching parents. Studies have shown that OPC is effective to promote children's activity participation. However, there have been limited randomized controlled trials demonstrating the efficacy of OPC, especially with the specific focus on children's community participation.

The investigators propose to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial of OPC for parents of preschool children with developmental disabilities in Hong Kong, and to test its initial efficacy on promoting children's community participation.","High rates of restricted community participation have been reported in young children with developmental disabilities.

However, there have been limited randomized controlled trials demonstrating the efficacy of OPC, especially with a specific focus on children's community participation.

Claude-4.5-Sonnet,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"Parent coaching emerges as a preferred approach for enhancing performance and participation of children with developmental disabilities (DD), but limited clinical trials examine its effects on community participation. Thus, this study aims to evaluate whether parent coaching, specifically using Occupational Performance Coaching (OPC), enhances community participation among young children with DD.

Young children with DD will be recruited from preschool-rehabilitation services offered by three non-governmental organisations in Hong Kong. Ethics approval has been obtained from the Human Subjects Ethics Sub-committee at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

A two-arm parallel, double-blind design will be adopted for the study. Fifty parents of young children with DD will be randomly assigned to the intervention group (i.e., OPC) or the active control group (i.e., parents' consultation). Four assessment points will be scheduled throughout the study: 5-6 weeks before intervention (Time 0), 1-2 weeks before intervention (Time 1), 1-2 weeks after intervention (Time 2), and 8-9 weeks after the intervention (Time 3). Randomisation allocation will be completed at Time 1. Participants and independent outcome assessors will not be informed about the groupings.

Each parent will receive a maximum of eight coaching sessions or consultations. The primary outcome will be children's community participation as assessed through parent-report measures at baseline, pre-intervention, post-intervention, and an 8-week follow-up. Children in both groups will continue to receive their usual care, which may include services such as occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and speech therapy on a weekly/monthly basis, depending on their individual needs.

Independent t-test and chi-square statistics will be used to test for between-group baseline differences. To evaluate the effect of OPC on each outcome measure, repeated-measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) by controlling for baseline values per outcome will be used. Post-hoc analyses will be performed when the main effects were significant. Statistical significance is set at p \< 0.05. Estimates of effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for each outcome measure.","This is a feasibility and pilot double-blind randomized controlled trial. Fifty children aged 6 years or below with developmental disabilities and their parents will be recruited from early intervention centers and/or through social media in Hong Kong. Parents will be randomly assigned to receive OPC or consultation, and will be blinded to group allocation. Outcomes will be assessed by blinded assessors at baseline, pre-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up. Predetermined success criteria will be used to assess the feasibility of the trial. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with parents to explore the acceptability and perceived impact of OPC.

The OPC intervention comprises three components defined as the enabling domains: (1) connect–building parents' trust in the coach by using verbal and nonverbal strategies such as listening, empathizing, and partnering; (2) structure–building parents' competence by adopting a problem-solving framework of setting goals, exploring options, planning action, carrying out plans, checking performance, and generalizing; and (3) share–building parents' autonomy by reciprocally exchanging information between the coach and parents with an emphasis on eliciting parents existing knowledge. The OPC intervention will consist of four to eight weekly (or fortnightly) sessions in correspondence with the number of goals identified by parents and the progress of the goal achievement. Each session will last 30 min to 1 h.

Parents who are randomized to the control treatment will receive consultation regarding community resources from occupational therapists or occupational therapy students. A toolbox of community resources has been developed by the research team by identifying public playgrounds, play groups, and sports programs sponsored by non-governmental organizations or government. The direct informing approach will be used to instruct parents about the availability of environmental resources close to their living areas and what they can plan to do by using possible supportive strategies. The consultations will be conducted for four to eight weekly/fortnightly sessions depending on the parents' needs, and each session may last 30 min to 1 h.

This trial will test whether the study protocol and OPC are feasible and acceptable, as well as assess the initial efficacy of OPC to obtain effect size estimates. The results of the trial will inform future preparations for conducting a full-scale efficacy trial of OPC.",True,0.96,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
