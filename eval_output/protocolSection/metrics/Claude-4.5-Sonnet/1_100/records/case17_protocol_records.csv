* To further examine the efficacy and safety of Tenoten® in the treatment of anxiety in patients with somatoform, stress-related and other neurotic disorders.
* To compare the efficacy of two dosing regimens of Tenoten® (4 tablets daily vs.8 tablets daily, both for 12 weeks) in the treatment of anxiety in patients with somatoform, stress-related and other neurotic disorders.","This multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial investigated the safety and efficacy of Tenoten, an anxiolytic drug containing highly diluted antibodies to S100 protein, in treating anxiety in adults with somatoform dysfunction (SfD), reaction to severe stress (RSS), adjustment disorders (AjD), and other neurotic disorders (oNDs). A total of 390 adult patients with HADS-A score ≥11 were randomized into 4 groups: Tenoten group 1 (4 tablets/day, n=127), Tenoten group 3 (8 tablets/day, n=131), and combined Placebo groups (n=132). The primary outcome was the change from baseline in mean Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) score after 12 weeks. Results showed significant decrease in HAM-A scores in both Tenoten groups compared to placebo (p=0.0055 for group 1, p<0.0001 for group 3). A total of 46 adverse events were reported (28 in Tenoten groups, 18 in Placebo) with no significant difference between groups.

Claude-4.5-Sonnet,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"Design: an international, a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel group placebo-controlled trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of study treatment.

The study will enroll outpatient subjects of both genders aged 18-45 years with verified diagnoses of somatoform, stress-related and other neurotic disorders (F43, F45, F48) and signs of clinically relevant anxiety according to The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS).

After signing the informed consent form to participate in the clinical study the subject will be interviewed (complaints, medical history, concomitant therapy) and objective examination will be performed; the subject will fill HADS scale. The severity of anxiety at screening should be ≥ 11 according to HADS. If the subject meets inclusion criteria and has no exclusion criteria he/she will be enrolled into the study. The investigator will determine the severity of anxiety using НАМ-А scale; the subject will fill EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. At Visit 1 (Day 1) the subject will be randomized into one of the treatment groups:

* Group 1: Tenoten® at 2 tablets twice daily (4 tablets/day);
* Group 2: Placebo at 2 tablets twice daily (4 tablets/day);
* Group 3: Tenoten® at 2 tablets 4 daily (8 tablets/day).
* Group 4: Placebo at 2 tablets 4 daily (8 tablets/day). The first dose should be administered at Visit 1 after the visit procedures are completed. Further administration of the study product will be made according to the dosing scheme. The subject will administer the study product and will be followed for 12 weeks during which additional three visits will be made. At Visit 2 (Week 4), Visit 3 (Week 8) and Visit 4 (Week 12) the physician will record patients' complaints and physical examination data, fill HAM-A scale, check the study and concomitant therapy, assess treatment safety and patient compliance with the study treatment. At the final Visit 4 the subject will fill EQ-5D-3L questionnaire and the investigator will fill the Clinical Global Impression Scale Efficacy Index (CGI-EI).

Subjects will be allowed to take symptomatic therapy and medications for their co-morbidities during the study, except for the medicines listed in ""Prohibited therapy"".","The existing treatments for somatoform dysfunction (SfD), reaction to severe stress (RSS), and adjustment disorders (AjD) are insufficiently effective and safe. This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of Tenoten, an anxiolytic drug containing highly diluted antibodies to S100 protein, in treating anxiety in adults with these conditions and other neurotic disorders (oNDs). The trial was a multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial conducted at 23 sites in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan between February 2017 and March 2019.

Outpatients aged 18-45 years with anxiety and diagnosed SfD (F45.0-F45.9), RSS and AjD (F43.0-F43.9), or other NDs (F48.8-F48.9) with HADS-A scores ≥11 were enrolled. A total of 390 patients were randomized into 4 groups: Tenoten group 1 (2 pills 2 times/day, n=127), Tenoten group 3 (2 pills 4 times/day, n=131), and Placebo groups 2+4 (combined, n=132). The treatment period lasted 12 weeks.

The primary outcome was the change from baseline in mean HAM-A score after 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included changes at 4 and 8 weeks, percentage of responders (≥50% reduction on HAM-A), percentage of patients without anxiety (HAM-A <14), changes in EQ-5D-3L scores, and CGI-EI scores. Post-hoc analysis assessed the effect of diagnosis type on HAM-A scores and subscores.

Results showed significant decrease in HAM-A scores in both Tenoten groups: from 18.81±5.81 to 7.26±4.63 in group 1 (p=0.0055 vs placebo) and from 18.38±4.3 to 6.40±4.02 in group 3 (p<0.0001 vs placebo). Remission rates (HAM-A <14) after 12 weeks were 88.1% in group 1 and 96.2% in group 3 (p=0.007 vs placebo for group 3). Response rates (≥50% reduction) were 69.8% and 73.8% in groups 1 and 3, respectively, compared to 53.9% in placebo (p<0.05). Quality of life improved significantly in group 3 (p=0.031 vs placebo).

Safety analysis showed 46 adverse events (10 in group 1, 18 in group 3, 18 in placebo) with no significant difference between groups. No serious adverse events or definite drug-related adverse events were reported. The study concluded that Tenoten demonstrated significant efficacy over placebo in treating anxiety in adults with SfD, RSS, AjD, and oNDs, with a favorable safety profile.",True,0.96,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
