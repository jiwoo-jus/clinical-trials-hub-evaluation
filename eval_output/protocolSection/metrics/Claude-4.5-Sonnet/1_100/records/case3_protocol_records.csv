Despite their widespread and increasing use, data about the impact of personal digital device use on patient-reported outcomes and healthcare utilisation are sparse. Among a population of patients with atrial fibrillation and/or atrial flutter undergoing cardioversion, the primary aim is to determine the impact of the heart rate measurement, irregular rhythm notification, and ECG features of the Apple Watch on quality of life and healthcare utilisation.",True,0.86,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
Claude-4.5-Sonnet,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"This is a a randomized, controlled trial to determine the impact of the Apple Watch Series 6 compared to the Withings Move on both patient-reported outcomes and clinical utilization over 6 months and up to 1 year. Our research method will employ a patient-centered health data sharing platform (called Hugo) for real-world surveillance of outcomes in 150 total patients after they receive elective direct current cardioversion (DCCV) or catheter ablation for treatment of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Patients will be enrolled at each of 3 clinical sites: Yale-New Haven Hospital, the Mayo Clinic, and Duke Health. Half of the patients will be randomized to receive the Apple Watch Series 6, while half will receive a control device (Withings Move). Patients will then be queried about specific symptoms related to atrial fibrillation and medication adherence monthly. This project will provide novel and needed post-market data about the Apple Watch Series 6 ECG and irregular rhythm detection notification features and, on a larger scale, help delineate the impact of an innovative digital health technology on real-world patient outcomes.

Specific Aim 1: To assess the impact of using the Apple Watch ECG and irregular rhythm notification features on patient-reported outcomes and clinical utilization after patients receive cardioversion or catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.

Specific Aim 2: To determine the accuracy of the Apple Watch ECG compared to physician interpretation of 12-lead ECGs obtained in routine clinical care.","This is a prospective, open-label multicentre pragmatic randomised clinical trial, leveraging a unique patient-centred health data sharing platform (Hugo) for enrolment and follow-up. A total of 150 patients undergoing cardioversion for atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter will be randomised 1:1 to receive the Apple Watch Series 6 or Withings Move at the time of cardioversion. The primary outcome is the difference in the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy-of-life (AFEQT) global score at 6 months postcardioversion. Secondary outcomes include inpatient and outpatient healthcare utilisation, including emergency department visits, observation stays, hospitalisations, outpatient visits, and rhythm-related diagnostic testing. Additional secondary outcomes include a comparison of the Apple Watch ECG and pulse oximeter features with gold-standard data obtained in routine clinical care settings. The study will enrol patients at three academic health systems: Yale New Haven Health, Mayo Clinic, and Duke Health. Patients are followed through the Hugo platform, which aggregates electronic health data from multiple sources including electronic health records, personal digital devices, and patient-reported outcome measures delivered via text or email. The study began patient screening in July 2021 with anticipated completion by December 31, 2022. The trial will provide important data to policymakers, clinicians and patients about the impact of the heart rate, irregular rhythm notification, and ECG features of widely used personal digital devices on patient quality of life and healthcare utilisation.",True,0.96,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
