Claude-4.5-Sonnet,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,TP,FP,"This randomized phase II trial is studying how well carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab work when given with or without everolimus in treating patients with malignant melanoma that has spread from where it started to other places in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy given together with bevacizumab is more effective with or without everolimus in treating patients with metastatic melanoma.","This study evaluated the prognostic significance of detectable circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) BRAF V600E/K mutations in patients with advanced melanoma enrolled in a clinical trial without BRAF-targeted therapy. The hypothesis was that detectable cfDNA BRAF mutations may correlate with clinical outcomes, including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), in patients with stage IV melanoma. The study analyzed stored plasma samples and archived tissue from 149 patients to determine BRAF mutation status and assess its relationship to prognosis.",False,0.23,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
Claude-4.5-Sonnet,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To assess whether there is sufficient promise of an impact of the addition of everolimus to the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab on progression-free survival that it would be recommended for further testing in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma.

Secondary

* To estimate the confirmed tumor response rate of each of the treatment regimens.
* To estimate the distribution of overall survival (OS) time for each of the treatment regimens.
* To assess the impact on the safety profile of the addition of everolimus to the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to elevated LDH (above upper limit of normal) at baseline (yes vs no), location of metastatic disease (M1a \[skin, subcutaneous tissue, or lymph node only\] vs M1b \[lung\] vs M1c \[other visceral sites\]) and prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

ARM I: Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15, paclitaxel IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

ARM II: Patients receive bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin as in Arm I. Patients also receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) 3 times weekly. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for up to 5 years.","NCCTG (North Central Cancer Treatment Group) N0879 was a randomized phase 2 clinical trial evaluating patients with unresectable stage IV melanoma treated with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab with or without everolimus. The trial enrolled 149 patients between May 5, 2010 and May 2, 2014. BRAF V600E/K mutation status was determined on archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue and pretreatment stored frozen plasma samples. Tissue DNA was analyzed using a clinical 50-gene hotspot PCR-based next-generation sequencing panel. Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) was extracted from plasma and analyzed for BRAF V600E/K mutations using a validated digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) assay. Results were reported as the presence or absence of cfDNA BRAF V600E/K detection compared to tissue. The study assessed progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients with and without detectable BRAF mutations in cfDNA. Of 63 patients with both tissue and blood samples available, 20 (31.7%) had tissue-diagnosed mutant BRAF, and of these, 11 (55.0%) had detectable plasma cfDNA BRAF. The assay demonstrated sensitivity of 55%, specificity of 97.7%, positive predictive value of 91.7%, and negative predictive value of 82.4%. Among patients with tissue-mutant BRAF V600E/K, PFS and OS were shorter for those with corresponding cfDNA mutations (PFS: 5.8 vs 12.0 months, P=0.051; OS: 9.2 vs 27.1 months, P=0.054). Multivariate analysis showed that elevated LDH levels at baseline were associated with increased risk for disease progression and death. The study concluded that detectable cfDNA BRAF V600E/K mutation appears to confer a poorer prognosis when detectable and may serve as a tool to risk-stratify patients with metastatic melanoma in practice or clinical trials.",True,0.86,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
