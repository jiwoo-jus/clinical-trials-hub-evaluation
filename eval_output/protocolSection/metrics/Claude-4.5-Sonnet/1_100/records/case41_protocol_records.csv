Claude-4.5-Sonnet,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,TP,TP,The primary objective of the randomized observer-blinded phase 2b/3 part of this trial is to demonstrate the efficacy of a 2-dose schedule of CVnCoV in the prevention of first episodes of virologically-confirmed cases of COVID-19 of any severity in SARS-CoV-2 naïve participants.,"HERALD is a randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 2b/3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of the CVnCoV SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine candidate. The study was conducted in 47 centres across ten countries in Europe and Latin America. Adults aged 18 years or older with no history of virologically confirmed COVID-19 were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either two 0.6 mL doses of CVnCoV containing 12 μg of mRNA or placebo on days 1 and 29. The primary efficacy endpoint was the occurrence of a first episode of virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 of any severity from 15 days after the second dose. The trial aimed to demonstrate vaccine efficacy with a lower limit of the confidence interval greater than 30%.",True,0.94,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False

(That is, clinical trial information for this applicable clinical trial was submitted under section 402(j)(4)(A) of the Public Health Service Act and 42 CFR 11.60 and is not subject to the deadlines established by sections 402(j)(2) and (3) of the Public Health Service Act or 42 CFR 11.24 and 11.44.).","HERALD is an ongoing, randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 2b/3 clinical trial conducted in 47 public and private hospitals and clinics across Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Argentina, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Panama, and Peru. The trial enrolled 39,680 participants between December 11, 2020, and April 12, 2021. Participants were adults aged 18 years or older with no history of virologically confirmed COVID-19. Exclusion criteria included recent receipt of investigational or non-registered vaccines or drugs, and planned receipt of any investigational SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either CVnCoV or placebo, stratified by country and age group (18-60 years and ≥61 years). CVnCoV is a chemically unmodified mRNA vaccine candidate encoding the stabilised, full-length, native SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, protected by lipid nanoparticles. Each dose contained 12 μg of mRNA in 0.6 mL, administered intramuscularly on days 1 and 29.

The primary efficacy outcome was virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 of any severity from 15 days after the second dose up to 1 year. Key secondary endpoints included moderate-to-severe COVID-19, severe COVID-19, and COVID-19 by age group. An exploratory endpoint assessed efficacy against individual variants of concern or interest. The trial was event-driven, requiring 160 COVID-19 cases for final analysis with 90% power to show vaccine efficacy greater than 30%.

Safety outcomes included solicited local and systemic adverse events for 7 days after each dose, unsolicited adverse events for 28 days after each dose in phase 2b participants, and serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest up to 1 year after the second dose. Participants were monitored for COVID-19 symptoms through twice-weekly mobile application contacts and underwent RT-PCR testing upon suspicion of COVID-19. Viral sequencing was performed to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants.

The primary efficacy analysis included 12,851 participants in the CVnCoV group and 12,211 in the placebo group, with a mean observation period of 48.2 days. The trial met prespecified success criteria for efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 of any severity (vaccine efficacy 48.2%, 95.826% CI 31.0-61.4) and moderate-to-severe COVID-19 (vaccine efficacy 70.7%, 95% CI 42.5-86.1). Approximately 50% of COVID-19 cases were caused by variants of concern, 35% by variants of interest, and only 3% by wild-type B.1 lineage SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine efficacy was similar against alpha, gamma, and lambda variants in participants aged 18-60 years.

Solicited adverse events were more common in CVnCoV recipients (96.5%) than placebo recipients (67.9%), but were mostly transient and mild-to-moderate. The most frequently reported local reaction was injection-site pain (83.6%), and the most common systemic reactions were fatigue (80.0%) and headache (76.9%). Serious adverse events were uncommon and similar between groups (0.4% CVnCoV vs 0.3% placebo). No fatal adverse events were considered vaccination-related.

Despite meeting efficacy endpoints, the decision was made to cease activities on CVnCoV and focus on next-generation vaccine candidates, considering the evolving landscape of SARS-CoV-2 variants and development timelines.",False,0.02,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False

The following methods of birth control are considered highly effective when used consistently and correctly:

  * Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal or transdermal);
  * Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable or implantable);

These include severe and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal disease, liver disease, renal disease, respiratory disease, endocrine disorder, and neurological and psychiatric illnesses. However, those with controlled and stable cases can be included in the trial.
