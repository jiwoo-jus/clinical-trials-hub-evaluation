With the mixed evidence on the causative effect of LDL cholesterol on increased cardiovascular health risk, further studies are warranted to examine the relation of elevated LDL and other biomarkers of cardiovascular health in response to a lifestyle intervention. Furthermore, this study will investigate weight loss and body composition changes with adherence to this dietary intervention over a 140-day period. In this study the efficacy of Nic's Ketogenic diet on weight loss and biomarkers of cardiovascular health will be examined.",,False,0.0,,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,False,False,False,False
