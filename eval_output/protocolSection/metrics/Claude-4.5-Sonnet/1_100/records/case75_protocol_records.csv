The hypothesis was that ruxolitinib could potentially disrupt the parasite-induced dysfunctional immune response in malaria when given with antimalarial therapy. Eight healthy male and female participants aged 18 to 55 years were randomized to receive either ruxolitinib (20 mg) or placebo, administered 2 hours after artemether-lumefantrine (80/480 mg) twice daily for 3 days. The study assessed adverse events, drug exposure, and the pharmacodynamic effect of ruxolitinib measured by inhibition of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3). Results showed that the combination was well tolerated, with mild adverse events consistent with the known profiles of both drugs. Ruxolitinib coadministration did not affect artemether-lumefantrine pharmacokinetics and resulted in a 3-fold greater pSTAT3 inhibition compared to placebo, with a direct and predictable relationship between ruxolitinib plasma concentrations and pSTAT3 inhibition.",False,0.56,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
Claude-4.5-Sonnet,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"This is a randomised, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, single centre, phase 1 trial.

Eight healthy males or females, aged between 18-55 years old, who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, will be enrolled.

The study will be composed of 2 groups to be enrolled sequentially.

• Group 1a (sentinel group): two participants will be randomised single-blinded such that one participant will receive AL+Rux and the other participant will receive AL+placebo.

After review of the safety and tolerability data up to and including Day 8 from Group 1a by the Safety Review Committee (SRC), a decision to proceed with Group 1b will be made.

• Group 1b will be composed of 6 participants, to be randomised single-blinded such that five participants will receive AL+Rux, and one participant will receive AL+placebo.","Malaria remains a major global health issue, with poor understanding of host immunity against Plasmodium species being a key impediment to eradication. Evidence indicates the presence of parasite-induced immunoregulatory mechanisms that promote the development of atypical B cells, suboptimal function of CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and Tbet+ CD4+ T (Th1) cells, and interleukin-10 (IL-10) production. Type I interferons (IFNs) are important regulators of IL-10 production by Tr1 cells and signal through the common IFN-α receptor (IFNAR) via signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT). Polymorphisms in the IFNAR1 gene have been associated with increased risk of severe malaria.

Ruxolitinib is an orally administered small molecule inhibitor of Janus-Associated Kinase 1 (JAK1) and JAK2 approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease. Ruxolitinib has been shown to block type I IFN signaling in a range of human diseases. The potential for ruxolitinib to disrupt the parasite-induced dysfunctional immune response in malaria requires investigation. This study aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of ruxolitinib when coadministered with artemether-lumefantrine, an approved artemisinin-based combination therapy widely used for treatment of uncomplicated malaria.

This randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center phase 1 trial included eight healthy volunteers randomized to receive either ruxolitinib (20 mg, n=6) or placebo (n=2) administered 2 hours after artemether-lumefantrine (80/480 mg) twice daily for 3 days. The ruxolitinib dose of 20 mg twice daily is the standard dose for treatment of myelofibrosis. A 3-day ruxolitinib dosing regimen was considered appropriate based on reported safety and expected pSTAT3 inhibition in previous trials.

The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability. Secondary objectives were to assess the effect on pSTAT3 inhibition and to characterize the pharmacokinetic profiles of artemether, its major metabolite dihydroartemisinin, lumefantrine, and ruxolitinib. Pharmacodynamic activity of ruxolitinib was assessed by measuring pSTAT3 inhibition using Meso Scale Discovery immunoassay kits. Blood samples were stimulated ex vivo with 100 ng/ml human IL-6 for 15 minutes. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using noncompartmental methods and the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship was examined through modeling.

Results showed that all adverse events were mild, with no serious adverse events or adverse events leading to study discontinuation. The combination of artemether-lumefantrine and ruxolitinib was well tolerated, with adverse events and pharmacokinetics consistent with the known profiles of both drugs. Ruxolitinib coadministration resulted in a 3-fold greater pSTAT3 inhibition compared to placebo (geometric mean ratio = 3.01, 90% confidence interval = 2.14 to 4.24). A direct and predictable relationship was found between ruxolitinib plasma concentrations and %pSTAT3 inhibition, best described by a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model and a simple direct effect sigmoidal Emax model. These findings support further investigation of the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and ruxolitinib in healthy volunteers infected with Plasmodium falciparum malaria.",True,0.84,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
