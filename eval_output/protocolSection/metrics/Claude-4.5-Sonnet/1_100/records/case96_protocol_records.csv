Claude-4.5-Sonnet,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,TP,TP,"The objective of this pilot study to evaluate if behavioral incentives applied at the VA Medical Center can appreciably increase participation in activities that promote mobility, and subsequently reduce pain severity and opioid use.","Chronic pain is highly prevalent among veterans, with rates of opioid use higher than civilian populations. Increasing physical activity can reduce pain severity and decrease opioid use in patients with chronic pain. Behavioral economic strategies combining lottery incentives with loss aversion have been effective in promoting physical activity in non-veteran populations without chronic pain. This study evaluated whether a ""regret lottery"" - where veterans could win money if they met activity goals or were told what they would have won had they met their goals - would increase physical activity levels among veterans with chronic pain. The hypothesis was that this behavioral economic approach would motivate increased physical activity through immediate gratification and avoidance of regret.",True,0.7,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
Claude-4.5-Sonnet,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,FP,"Chronic pain is a highly prevalent and costly condition in the US. An estimated 88.5 million adults suffer from daily pain, resulting in estimated cost of $500- 635 biJlion due to lost productivity, and $261-300 billion in health care expenditures. To manage their chronic pain, 5 to 8 million Americans take an opioid medication daily. Yet , the risks associated with ongoing opioid prescription , including overdose, abuse and diversion, temper their analgesic effects.

Opioids are not more effective in the treatment of chronic pain compared with non-opioid approaches. Current guidelines have adapted to the evidence, recommending opioid-sparing approaches for treating patients with chronic pain, and tapering for those on higher doses to safer levels of use. Tapering opioids, however, requires replacing them with effective non-opioid strategies. Improving mobility has been shown to improve pain and decrease medication use among patients chronically prescribed opiates. Concurrently, financial incentives and the use of behavioral incentives have been shown to promote mobility.

Appreciating the gains in health outcomes that can be made with ""connected health"" approaches, we propose a novel pilot study designed to evaluate if technology enabled care (TEC) strategies and financial incentives can improve patient mobility in our chronic pain population, reduce pain and decrease opioid use . Our primary aim is to determine if chronic pain patients who receive TEC-enhanced treatment with financial incentives demonstrate increased participation in activities that promote mobility (physical therapy, yoga, tai chi) in comparison to patients receiving usual care. Secondary outcomes will include whether increased activity participation also reduces pain severity and opioid use, and improves function and increases the number of daily steps taken. The results of this pilot will enable us to determine what strategies are effective at increasing mobility and if these gains translate into reduced pain and decreased opioid use.","This was a 12-week single-blinded randomized controlled trial conducted at the Corporal Michael J. Crescenz VA Medical Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Forty veterans with chronic non-malignant pain receiving care from a pain-focused primary aligned care team (Pain PACT) were enrolled between July 2019 and January 2020. Participants were randomized 1:1 to either a control arm (activity trackers and daily text message reminders to increase physical activity) or an intervention arm (same as control plus a weekly regret lottery). The regret lottery provided participants who met weekly activity goals (either a 5% increase in steps over the previous week, or achieving and maintaining 150% of baseline steps) with a chance to win a small ($30; 18% chance) or large ($100; 1% chance) gift card incentive. Those who did not meet their goals were informed of what they would have won had they met their goal. The primary outcome was physical activity measured using Fitbit step counts and the Stanford 7-Day Physical Activity Recall Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes included pain-related physical function (Pain Outcomes Questionnaire), chronic pain severity, depression symptoms (PHQ-9), and opioid analgesic use extracted from electronic health records. All participants received $75 for complete study participation. Data were collected at baseline and at 12 weeks, with activity tracking occurring throughout the study period. The study utilized the Way to Health platform for enrollment, randomization, bi-directional text messaging, lottery administration, and integration of activity tracker data.",False,0.68,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
