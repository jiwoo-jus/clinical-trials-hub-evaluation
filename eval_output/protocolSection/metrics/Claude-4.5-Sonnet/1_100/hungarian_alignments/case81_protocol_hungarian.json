ROP was identified by routine ophthalmologic examinations beginning at the latter of 31 weeks PMA or 4-6 weeks chronologic age. The favorable ROP endpoint requires that no ROP, or only mild ROP has occurred in both eyes and the eyes have matured beyond the risk of developing Type 1 ROP (severity meeting criteria for surgical intervention). The unfavorable ROP endpoint requires that one or both eyes reach Type 1 ROP. When ROP did not resolve by the time of discharge, participants were followed as outpatients until reaching an ROP endpoint, up to 55 weeks PMA. Since incomplete follow up is more likely among participants with mild or no ROP than for those with aggressive ROP, an independent adjudication process assigned an ROP endpoint of 'most likely never had Type 1 ROP', or 'most likely developed Type 1 ROP' based on clinical and ROP data review to reduce possible missing data bias.",
