Messages employ the Information-Motivation-Behaviour Skills (IMB) framework to promote: (1) maternal implementation of essential newborn care (ENC, including early exclusive breast feeding, cord care and thermal care), (2) maternal identification of neonatal danger signs and care-seeking, and (3) maternal social support and self-efficacy. The intervention uses a custom human-computer hybrid software system to manage incoming and outgoing SMS. Participants can send SMS to study nurses enabling on-demand remote support. Study nurses respond to participant messages during business hours within one business day, with urgent responses for danger signs or serious adverse events. Messages are delivered at prespecified day, time and language based on participant preferences. Additional messaging tracks are provided for high-risk groups including first-time mothers, mothers ≤19 years, women with elevated depression symptoms, and mothers of premature or low birth weight infants.",
