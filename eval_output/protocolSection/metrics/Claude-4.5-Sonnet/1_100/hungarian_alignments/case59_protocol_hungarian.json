Scores for Controlled Regulation can range from 8 to 56. High scores indicate high controlled motivation or extrinsic motivation for behavior engagement.\n\nScoring for RAI will consist of subtracting the average for Controlled Regulation from the average for Autonomous Regulation. Higher RAI scores indicate higher autonomous or intrinsic motivation for behavior engagement.",
