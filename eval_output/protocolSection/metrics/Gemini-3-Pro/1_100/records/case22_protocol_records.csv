Gemini-3-Pro,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,TP,TP,"The present study will investigate the effects of Nic's Ketogenic diet, comprised of 70% fat, 5% carbohydrate, and 25% protein on middle-aged males and females with mid-range elevated LDL. With the mixed evidence on the causative effect of LDL cholesterol on increased cardiovascular health risk, further studies are warranted to examine the relation of elevated LDL and other biomarkers of cardiovascular health in response to a lifestyle intervention. Furthermore, this study will investigate weight loss and body composition changes with adherence to this dietary intervention over a 140-day period. In this study the efficacy of Nic's Ketogenic diet on weight loss and biomarkers of cardiovascular health will be examined.","This open-label pilot study investigated the efficacy and safety of a very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD), specifically known as Nic's Ketogenic Diet, over a period of 140 days. The study focused on healthy adults with mildly elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The primary objective was to assess changes in cardiometabolic markers, body composition, and weight loss. The hypothesis was that the diet would induce beneficial changes in these parameters without causing significant adverse effects.",True,0.94,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False

Participants followed Nic's Ketogenic Diet, which provided 5% of calories from carbohydrates, 70% from fat, and 25% from protein, for 140 days. 

Assessments were conducted at Day 0, 28, 56, 70, 84, 112, and 140. Key measurements included weight, blood pressure (BP), and fasting plasma lipids at all visits. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans for body composition (body fat %, android fat, gynoid fat, muscle mass) were performed on Day 0, 70, and 140. Additional blood markers such as glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), C-reactive protein (CRP), free triiodothyronine (T3), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were measured at baseline and Day 140.

Participants monitored compliance through weekly 3-day food records, daily ketone and glucose monitoring, and regular counseling with a Registered Dietitian. Safety was evaluated through adverse event reporting, electrocardiograms, and clinical chemistry panels.",,,,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,True,False,True,False,False,False
