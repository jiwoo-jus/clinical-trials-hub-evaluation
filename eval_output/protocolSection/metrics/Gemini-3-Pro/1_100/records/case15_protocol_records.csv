To get an idea of how much of an impact this condition has on a person’s life, we tested a NI Diary where patients with this condition can answer a series of 12 questions pertaining to how this condition affects them. During a 12-week clinical trial in which participants received a novel drug candidate, participants were asked on five occasions to answer these questions every evening for three consecutive nights preceding the visit to the clinic. A number of measurement tests were conducted on the diary to ensure it reliably assesses the severity of nocturia and its impact on quality of life (QoL) in the patient population. In exit interviews, participants expressed support for the usefulness of this Diary to reflect their views. This Diary may become a valuable tool for use in clinical trials and real-world studies.",False,0.62,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False

As part of a randomized, controlled Phase 2 clinical trial investigating a novel drug candidate for nocturnal polyuria, adult nocturia patients completed the NI Diary and a voiding diary for three nights preceding their clinic visit at Baseline and Weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12 (end of treatment). Exit interviews were conducted to obtain patient impressions of the NI Diary. The current study extends earlier work, investigating the reliability, validity, and interpretability of the NI Diary in a larger sample, using a range of evaluations including confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), internal consistency, test–retest reliability, convergent validity, and known-groups validity. Anchor and distribution-based analyses were utilized to identify a meaningful change threshold.",,,,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,True,False,True,False,False,False
