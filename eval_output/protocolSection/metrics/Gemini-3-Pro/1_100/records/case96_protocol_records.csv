Gemini-3-Pro,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"Chronic pain is a highly prevalent and costly condition in the US. An estimated 88.5 million adults suffer from daily pain, resulting in estimated cost of $500- 635 biJlion due to lost productivity, and $261-300 billion in health care expenditures. To manage their chronic pain, 5 to 8 million Americans take an opioid medication daily. Yet , the risks associated with ongoing opioid prescription , including overdose, abuse and diversion, temper their analgesic effects.

Opioids are not more effective in the treatment of chronic pain compared with non-opioid approaches. Current guidelines have adapted to the evidence, recommending opioid-sparing approaches for treating patients with chronic pain, and tapering for those on higher doses to safer levels of use. Tapering opioids, however, requires replacing them with effective non-opioid strategies. Improving mobility has been shown to improve pain and decrease medication use among patients chronically prescribed opiates. Concurrently, financial incentives and the use of behavioral incentives have been shown to promote mobility.

Appreciating the gains in health outcomes that can be made with ""connected health"" approaches, we propose a novel pilot study designed to evaluate if technology enabled care (TEC) strategies and financial incentives can improve patient mobility in our chronic pain population, reduce pain and decrease opioid use . Our primary aim is to determine if chronic pain patients who receive TEC-enhanced treatment with financial incentives demonstrate increased participation in activities that promote mobility (physical therapy, yoga, tai chi) in comparison to patients receiving usual care. Secondary outcomes will include whether increased activity participation also reduces pain severity and opioid use, and improves function and increases the number of daily steps taken. The results of this pilot will enable us to determine what strategies are effective at increasing mobility and if these gains translate into reduced pain and decreased opioid use.","A 12-week single-blinded randomized controlled trial was designed to assess the efficacy of a regret lottery intervention. Veterans with chronic pain (N = 40) receiving care at a specialty pain clinic were eligible for participation and were randomly assigned (1:1) to either (a) activity trackers and daily text message reminders to increase physical activity (""control arm""), or (b) the same plus a weekly regret lottery (""intervention arm""). For those in the intervention arm, participants who met their activity goal had a chance to win a small ($30) or large ($100) gift card incentive; those who did not meet their goals were informed of what they would have won had they met their goal. 

The primary outcome, physical activity, was measured using self-reported physical activity (Stanford 7-Day Physical Activity Recall Questionnaire) and step counts using Fitbit activity trackers. Secondary outcomes included changes in physical function, chronic pain severity, depression (PHQ-9), and opioid use. The study aimed to determine if leveraging behavioral economic principles of immediate gratification and loss aversion could successfully promote physical activity in this population.",True,0.73,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
