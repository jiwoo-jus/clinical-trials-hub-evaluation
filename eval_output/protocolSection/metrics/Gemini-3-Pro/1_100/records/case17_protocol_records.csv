* To further examine the efficacy and safety of Tenoten® in the treatment of anxiety in patients with somatoform, stress-related and other neurotic disorders.
* To compare the efficacy of two dosing regimens of Tenoten® (4 tablets daily vs.8 tablets daily, both for 12 weeks) in the treatment of anxiety in patients with somatoform, stress-related and other neurotic disorders.","The aim of this multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was to investigate the safety and efficacy of the anxiolytic drug Tenoten in the treatment of anxiety in adults. The study focused on patients suffering from somatoform dysfunction (SfD), reaction to severe stress (RSS), adjustment disorders (AjD), and other neurotic disorders (oNDs). Participants were randomized to receive either Tenoten (at two different dosage levels) or a placebo over a 12-week period to assess improvements in anxiety symptoms.",True,0.97,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
Gemini-3-Pro,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"Design: an international, a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel group placebo-controlled trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of study treatment.

The study will enroll outpatient subjects of both genders aged 18-45 years with verified diagnoses of somatoform, stress-related and other neurotic disorders (F43, F45, F48) and signs of clinically relevant anxiety according to The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS).

After signing the informed consent form to participate in the clinical study the subject will be interviewed (complaints, medical history, concomitant therapy) and objective examination will be performed; the subject will fill HADS scale. The severity of anxiety at screening should be ≥ 11 according to HADS. If the subject meets inclusion criteria and has no exclusion criteria he/she will be enrolled into the study. The investigator will determine the severity of anxiety using НАМ-А scale; the subject will fill EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. At Visit 1 (Day 1) the subject will be randomized into one of the treatment groups:

* Group 1: Tenoten® at 2 tablets twice daily (4 tablets/day);
* Group 2: Placebo at 2 tablets twice daily (4 tablets/day);
* Group 3: Tenoten® at 2 tablets 4 daily (8 tablets/day).
* Group 4: Placebo at 2 tablets 4 daily (8 tablets/day). The first dose should be administered at Visit 1 after the visit procedures are completed. Further administration of the study product will be made according to the dosing scheme. The subject will administer the study product and will be followed for 12 weeks during which additional three visits will be made. At Visit 2 (Week 4), Visit 3 (Week 8) and Visit 4 (Week 12) the physician will record patients' complaints and physical examination data, fill HAM-A scale, check the study and concomitant therapy, assess treatment safety and patient compliance with the study treatment. At the final Visit 4 the subject will fill EQ-5D-3L questionnaire and the investigator will fill the Clinical Global Impression Scale Efficacy Index (CGI-EI).

Subjects will be allowed to take symptomatic therapy and medications for their co-morbidities during the study, except for the medicines listed in ""Prohibited therapy"".","The study enrolled 390 adult outpatients (aged 18–45 years) with anxiety scores ≥ 11 on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale-anxiety (HADS-A). Participants were diagnosed with SfD (ICD-10 codes F45.0, F45.1, F45.2, F45.4, F45.8, F45.9), RSS and AjD (F43.0, F43.1, F43.2, F43.8, F43.9), or other neurotic disorders (F48.8, F48.9). Patients were randomized into four groups: Tenoten group 1 (4 tablets/day), Tenoten group 3 (8 tablets/day), and Placebo groups 2 and 4 (combined for analysis). The treatment period lasted for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in the mean Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) score after 12 weeks. Exploratory outcomes included changes in HAM-A scores at 4 and 8 weeks, the percentage of responders (≥ 50% reduction on HAM-A), the percentage of patients achieving remission (HAM-A < 14), changes in EQ-5D-3L quality of life scores, and the Clinical Global Impression-Efficacy Index (CGI-EI).
