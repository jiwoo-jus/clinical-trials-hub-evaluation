Gemini-3-Pro,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,TP,TP,"Participation in community activities allows children to meet friends, learns new skills, fosters independence, and paves the foundation for lifelong health. High rates of community participation restriction have been reported in children with developmental disabilities who are aged six years or below, a critical developmental period.

Occupational Performance Coaching (OPC), grounded in self-determination theory, is aimed to facilitate children's participation in life situations through coaching parents. Studies have shown that OPC is effective to promote children's activity participation. However, there have been limited randomized controlled trials demonstrating the efficacy of OPC, especially with the specific focus on children's community participation.

The investigators propose to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial of OPC for parents of preschool children with developmental disabilities in Hong Kong, and to test its initial efficacy on promoting children's community participation.","High rates of restricted community participation have been reported in young children with developmental disabilities. This study evaluates the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial of Occupational Performance Coaching (OPC) in Hong Kong. It also tests the initial efficacy of OPC, compared to parent consultation, in promoting children's community participation.",True,0.96,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
Gemini-3-Pro,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"Parent coaching emerges as a preferred approach for enhancing performance and participation of children with developmental disabilities (DD), but limited clinical trials examine its effects on community participation. Thus, this study aims to evaluate whether parent coaching, specifically using Occupational Performance Coaching (OPC), enhances community participation among young children with DD.

Young children with DD will be recruited from preschool-rehabilitation services offered by three non-governmental organisations in Hong Kong. Ethics approval has been obtained from the Human Subjects Ethics Sub-committee at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

A two-arm parallel, double-blind design will be adopted for the study. Fifty parents of young children with DD will be randomly assigned to the intervention group (i.e., OPC) or the active control group (i.e., parents' consultation). Four assessment points will be scheduled throughout the study: 5-6 weeks before intervention (Time 0), 1-2 weeks before intervention (Time 1), 1-2 weeks after intervention (Time 2), and 8-9 weeks after the intervention (Time 3). Randomisation allocation will be completed at Time 1. Participants and independent outcome assessors will not be informed about the groupings.

Each parent will receive a maximum of eight coaching sessions or consultations. The primary outcome will be children's community participation as assessed through parent-report measures at baseline, pre-intervention, post-intervention, and an 8-week follow-up. Children in both groups will continue to receive their usual care, which may include services such as occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and speech therapy on a weekly/monthly basis, depending on their individual needs.

Independent t-test and chi-square statistics will be used to test for between-group baseline differences. To evaluate the effect of OPC on each outcome measure, repeated-measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) by controlling for baseline values per outcome will be used. Post-hoc analyses will be performed when the main effects were significant. Statistical significance is set at p \< 0.05. Estimates of effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for each outcome measure.","A feasibility and pilot double-blind randomized controlled trial will be undertaken involving fifty children aged 6 years or below with developmental disabilities (DD) and their parents in Hong Kong. Participants will be recruited from early intervention centers and through social media. Parents will be randomly assigned to receive either Occupational Performance Coaching (OPC) or parent consultation and will be blinded to group allocation.

The OPC intervention focuses on coaching parents to facilitate their children's participation in life situations, grounded in self-determination theory. It involves specific techniques to heighten parents' engagement in an action-reflection process. The control group receives consultation regarding community resources and generic supportive strategies.

Outcomes will be assessed by blinded assessors at baseline, pre-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up. Primary efficacy measures include the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) and the Young Children's Participation and Environment Measure (YC-PEM). Secondary outcomes include the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale (PSOC), Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21), and the Kiddy-KINDL Questionnaire. Predetermined success criteria will be used to assess the feasibility of the trial regarding recruitment, retention, adherence, blinding success, and fidelity. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with parents to explore the acceptability and perceived impact of OPC.",True,0.93,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
