Gemini-3-Pro,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,FP,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the Advanced Hybrid Closed Loop system (AHCL) in type 1 diabetes adult and pediatric subjects in a home setting. The main objective in conducting this research is to collect data from patients who use the AHCL system at home, at work, at school and everywhere else. Subjects will use 670G 4.0 system with Guardian Sensor 3 (GS3) during study period, and will be allowed to participate in continued access phase, and use 670G 4.0 system with GS3 and 780G system with Guardian 4 Sensor (G4S).","This multicenter single-arm study involved an intent-to-treat population of 157 individuals (39 adolescents aged 14–21 years and 118 adults aged ≥22–75 years) with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The study schedule included a run-in period (Visits 1–4) with sensor-augmented pump (SAP) with or without predictive low glucose management (PLGM) or automated basal (Auto Basal) use for approximately 14 days. This was followed by a study phase (Visits 5–18) where Auto Basal and automated bolus correction (Auto Correction) were enabled for approximately 90 days. A glucose target of 100 or 120 mg/dL was set during the first 45 ± 5 days of the study phase, followed by a switch to the other glucose target for the remaining 45 ± 5 days. Study endpoints included safety events and change in mean A1C, time in range (TIR, 70–180 mg/dL) and time below range (TBR, <70 mg/dL). Run-in and study phase values were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank test or paired t-test. The AHCL system includes a meal detection module and provides options for setting different glucose targets.",False,0.68,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
