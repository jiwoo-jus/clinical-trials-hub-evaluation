Gemini-3-Pro,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,TP,TP,"This study was a 2-treatment period, randomized, multicenter parallel-group study. The overall purpose of this study was to provide long- term safety data for fevipiprant (QAW039) (Dose 1 and Dose 2), compared with placebo, when added to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) steps 3, 4, and 5 standard-of-care (SoC) asthma therapy (GINA 2016), in patients with moderate-to- severe asthma.

The purpose of this study was to provide long-term safety data for QAW039 150 mg once daily and 450 mg once daily, compared with placebo, when added to GINA steps 3, 4, and 5 standard-of-care asthma therapy (GINA 2020) in adult and adolescent (≥12 years) patients with moderate-to-severe asthma. The study included 2 cohorts of patients:

1. Rollover patients who had completed any of the four Phase 3 pivotal efficacy studies with QAW039 (QAW039A2307, QAW039A2314, QAW039A2316, or QAW039A2317, hereafter referred to as Studies A2307, A2314, A2316, and A2317), thus providing data for a longer duration of exposure, and
2. New patients who had not previously participated in a study of QAW039, permitting an increase in the number of patients with long-term exposure to QAW039.

By including these 2 categories of patients, the total number of patients treated with QAW039 as well as the duration of exposure to QAW039 treatment was substantially increased, supporting evaluation of the safety profile of QAW039.","The SPIRIT study was a Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to assess the long-term safety of fevipiprant (150 mg and 450 mg once daily) when added to standard of care in patients aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma. The study consisted of a 52-week double-blind period followed by an optional 104-week single-blind period. While the primary objective was to monitor adverse events and serious adverse events, exploratory analyses evaluated the drug's efficacy regarding asthma exacerbation rates and lung function. The study included both newly enrolled patients and those rolling over from previous fevipiprant trials (LUSTER and ZEAL). The trial was terminated early by the sponsor due to a lack of sufficient efficacy observed in the broader Phase 3 clinical program.",True,0.97,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
Gemini-3-Pro,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,TP,"The study comprised 2-treatment period. Treatment Period 1 was a 52-week, double-blind treatment period in which QAW039 450 mg or 150 mg or placebo was added to standard-of-care asthma therapy according to GINA guidelines. Treatment Period 2 was an optional 104-week, single-blind treatment period in which patients received QAW039 450 mg or 150 mg or placebo added to standard-of-care asthma therapy according to GINA guidelines.","SPIRIT (NCT03052517) was a multicentre, parallel-group, 2-treatment period Phase 3 study. Treatment Period 1 was a 52-week, double-blind study, and Treatment Period 2 was an optional 104-week, single-blind study. The study aimed to evaluate the long-term safety of the oral prostaglandin D2 receptor 2 (DP2 receptor) antagonist fevipiprant in patients with uncontrolled asthma receiving treatment according to Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) steps 3, 4, or 5.

Patients were randomised in a 3:3:1 ratio to receive fevipiprant 150 mg, fevipiprant 450 mg, or placebo once daily. The study population included two cohorts: rollover patients who had completed a prior Phase 3 fevipiprant efficacy study (LUSTER-1, LUSTER-2, ZEAL-1, or ZEAL-2) and new patients who had not previously participated in a fevipiprant study. 

The primary endpoints focused on safety, specifically the time-to-first treatment-emergent adverse event (AE), serious AE (SAE), and AE leading to study treatment discontinuation. Exploratory efficacy analyses assessed the rate of moderate-to-severe asthma exacerbations and the average change from baseline in pre-dose forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). Data from both treatment periods were combined for analyses due to the study's early termination on December 16, 2019.",True,0.86,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
