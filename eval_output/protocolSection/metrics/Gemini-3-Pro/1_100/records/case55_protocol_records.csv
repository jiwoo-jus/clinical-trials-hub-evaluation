Gemini-3-Pro,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,TP,TP,"This FTIH study, intends to identify the doses of GSK3358699, which are well tolerated by the subjects whilst delivering a robust pharmacodynamic (PD) response. This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and PD profile of single (in both fed and fasted states) and multiple ascending doses of GSK3358699 in healthy male subjects within a pre-defined and controlled pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic range for each cohort. It also intends to understand the effect of GSK3358699 on systemic markers of inflammation following low dose in vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) challenge and local inflammation in cantharidin-induced blisters. The study has been carefully designed to explore the in vivo biology of the target and the potential for the study drug to become a transformative medicine for subjects in multiple immuno-inflammatory disease indications.","This first-in-human, randomized, Phase 1 study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of GSK3358699 in healthy male participants. GSK3358699 is a mononuclear myeloid-targeted bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family inhibitor designed to minimize toxicities associated with pan-BET inhibitors. The study assessed single ascending doses and repeat doses to determine tolerability and the drug's ability to target specific immune cells.",True,0.93,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
Gemini-3-Pro,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,FP,"Subjects who are enrolled in the dose escalation treatment Periods of Part A may choose to only take part in the dose escalation treatment Periods 1-3, or may choose to also take part in the challenge Treatment Period (Period 4). If a subject chooses to participate in the dose escalation treatment Periods 1-3 only, or does not (at screening) meet the eligibility criteria specific to challenges (treatment Period 4), a new subject will be recruited for treatment Period 4 only and will be regarded as a replacement subject. The study will be conducted in three Parts. Total duration for participation will be approximately 19 weeks for subjects taking part in all three dose escalation treatment Periods and 23 weeks if a subject takes part in all four treatment Periods of Part A. For replacement subjects only taking part in the challenge treatment Period (Period 4), approximate study duration will be 10 weeks. Total duration for participation will be approximately 9 weeks for Part B and 12 weeks for Part C. The study will be conducted in up to 80 subjects.","The study was conducted as a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind trial divided into parts to assess GSK3358699 in healthy males. Part A utilized a single ascending-dose crossover design involving three dose-escalating periods with doses ranging from 1 to 40 mg. Part C was a repeat-dose design where participants received 10 mg of GSK3358699 or placebo daily for up to 14 days. A planned Part B to evaluate food effects was not conducted.

The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability, including adverse events, laboratory safety data, vital signs, cardiac telemetry, and ECGs. Secondary objectives included evaluating the systemic pharmacokinetic profile of GSK3358699 and its metabolite GSK3206944, the intracellular pharmacokinetic profile in monocytes, and pharmacodynamics as measured by the inhibition of cytokine production (MCP-1, IL-6, TNF) in blood following ex vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. The study utilized an esterase-sensitive motif (ESM) approach intended to deliver the active metabolite preferentially to mononuclear-myeloid cells expressing human carboxyesterase-1 (CES-1). The study was terminated early due to cardiac-related adverse events observed during the repeat-dosing phase.",False,0.28,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
