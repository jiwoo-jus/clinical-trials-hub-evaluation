The study involved healthy participants aged 10 to 25 years to evaluate if the combined administration results in immunological interference against serogroup B test strains and to monitor the safety profile of the investigational vaccine.",True,0.86,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
Gemini-3-Pro,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,EV,EV,,"Neisseria meningitidis is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis. This study evaluated an investigational vaccine (MenABCWY) combining MenACWY-CRM and 4CMenB antigens. A total of 500 healthy individuals aged 10 to 25 years were randomized into five groups. Four groups received two doses administered 2 months apart of either: (1) MenABCWY, (2) 4CMenB plus MenACWY administered concomitantly in the same arm, (3) 4CMenB plus MenACWY administered concomitantly in different arms, or (4) 4CMenB administered alone. A fifth group received a single dose of MenACWY. 

The primary objective was to assess the immune response against pooled serogroup B test strains (for antigens fHbp, NadA, PorA, and NHBA) and serogroups A, C, W, and Y one month after the last vaccination, measured by serum bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA). The study was specifically powered to assess immunological interference against pooled serogroup B test strains. Secondary objectives included the assessment of immune responses one month post-first vaccination and the evaluation of reactogenicity and safety (solicited and unsolicited adverse events) following vaccine administration.",,,,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,True,False,True,False,False,False
