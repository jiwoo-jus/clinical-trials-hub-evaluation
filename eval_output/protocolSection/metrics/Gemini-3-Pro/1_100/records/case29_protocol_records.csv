Following surgery and anthracycline-based chemotherapy, participants will receive either trastuzumab emtansine at a dose of 3.6 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) and pertuzumab at a dose of 420 milligrams (mg) intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (q3w) or trastuzumab at a dose of 6 mg/kg and pertuzumab at a dose of 420 mg IV q3w in combination with a taxane.","The phase III KAITLIN study aimed to improve efficacy and reduce toxicity in high-risk human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–positive early breast cancer (EBC) by evaluating a treatment regimen replacing taxanes and trastuzumab with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1).

Gemini-3-Pro,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,EV,EV,,"KAITLIN (NCT01966471) is a randomized, multinational, open-label phase III study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) plus pertuzumab versus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab and taxane as adjuvant therapy for high-risk HER2-positive early breast cancer.

Participants included adults with excised HER2-positive EBC who were either node-positive (any tumor size/hormone status) or node-negative (tumor > 2.0 cm and hormone receptor-negative). Patients were randomized 1:1 to one of two arms:
1. AC-THP Arm: Anthracycline-based chemotherapy (3-4 cycles) followed by taxane (3-4 cycles) plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Trastuzumab plus pertuzumab were continued to complete 1 year of HER2-targeted therapy.
2. AC-KP Arm: Anthracycline-based chemotherapy (3-4 cycles) followed by 18 cycles of T-DM1 plus pertuzumab.

The coprimary endpoints were invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) in the node-positive subpopulation and the overall intention-to-treat population. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), distant recurrence-free interval, disease-free survival, and safety assessments including cardiac events and patient-reported outcomes (EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23).",,,,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,True,False,True,False,False,False
