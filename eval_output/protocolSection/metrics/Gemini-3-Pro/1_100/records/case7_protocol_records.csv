Trazpiroben is a peripherally selective dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist being developed for the treatment of chronic gastroparesis. The study assessed single and multiple oral doses of the drug compared to placebo.

Gemini-3-Pro,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,FP,"The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-906. TAK-906 is being tested to treat people who have symptomatic idiopathic or diabetic gastroparesis.

The study will enroll approximately 205 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups (in 1:1:1:1 ratio) which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

* TAK-906 Maleate 5 mg (After implementation of Amendment 8, participants will not be further randomized to this arm)
* TAK-906 Maleate 25 mg
* TAK-906 Maleate 50 mg Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a capsule that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient

Prior to Amendment 8, participants were randomized to receive TAK-906 5 mg. After implementation of Amendment 8, participants will not be further randomized to this dose arm. All participants will be asked to take one capsule twice daily, at approximately the same time each day throughout the study.

This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall study duration is approximately 17 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 30 days after receiving their last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.","This study was designed as a phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single- and multiple-ascending dose, parallel-group analysis. The primary objective was to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of trazpiroben administered as single and multiple doses in healthy male Japanese participants. The study design was consistent with a prior US study (AT-01C) to allow for informal comparison between the two populations.

A total of 24 participants were enrolled and divided into three cohorts (n = 8 per cohort). In each cohort, 6 participants received trazpiroben and 2 received placebo. The dosing regimen was as follows:
- Cohort 1: 50 mg
- Cohort 2: 100 mg
- Cohort 3: 10 mg

Participants received a single dose of the blinded study drug on Day 1 (single-dose phase). This was followed by multiple doses administered twice daily for 5 days from Day 3 through Day 7 (multiple-dose phase), with no evening dose on Day 7. Follow-up assessments occurred on Day 14.

Safety evaluations included monitoring of adverse events (AEs), physical examinations, vital signs, and standard 12-lead ECG parameters. PK analysis involved the collection of blood and urine samples to quantify trazpiroben and its metabolite, M23, using LC-MS/MS methods. Parameters assessed included AUC, Cmax, tmax, and elimination half-life. PD analysis utilized serum prolactin concentrations as a biomarker for dopamine D2 receptor antagonism, measuring AUC and Cmax of prolactin levels.",False,0.32,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
