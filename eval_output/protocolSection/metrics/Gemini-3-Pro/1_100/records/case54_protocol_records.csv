Gemini-3-Pro,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,TP,TP,"Current therapeutic approaches available for patients with advanced-stage melanoma remain inadequate, and existing approaches including those involving immunotherapy with cytokines and/or targeted strategies have resulted in disappointingly low rates of durable and complete responses. Correcting immune dysfunction in advanced-stage melanoma patients using tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as dasatinib is proposed to relicense the patient's immune system to respond optimally to specific immunization. The integration of antigens expressed by tumor-associated blood vessel cells provides a means to selectively target the genetically-/antigenically-heterogeneous population of tumor cells in the advanced-stage melanoma patient.

This is a single-center, prospective randomized Phase 2 trial evaluating the activity, safety and immune effects of dasatinib given in combination with an autologous type-1 polarized Dendritic Cell (αDC1) vaccine. The current trial represents a randomized Phase 2 study to determine the activity and safety of intradermal (id) administration of αDC1s loaded with a mixture of six TBVA-derived peptides at the time of, or immediately after, an initial therapy cycle with the TKI dasatinib.

Dasatinib will be administered at the standard dose and schedule recommended by the FDA (70 mg BID). The autologous type-I DC vaccine will be administered either prior to, or concomitant with, the initiation of dasatinib administration. All patients will receive dasatinib at a starting dose of 70 mg twice daily by mouth in the outpatient setting approximately every 12 hours, at the same time each day.

The DC vaccine will be administered by a single intradermal injection of approximately 10e7 cells, with all the DCs being administered on days 1 and 15 of every cycle on an outpatient basis in the University of Pittsburgh Clinical and Translational Research Center (UPCI-CTRC).

Patients on Arm A will start dasatinib administration on cycle 2, day 1 (week 5), while those patients in Arm B will start dasatinib administration on cycle 1, day 1 (week 1).

Men and women at least 18 years of age must be HLA-A2+ and have histologically confirmed melanoma that is metastatic (Stage IV) or unresectable Stage IIIB/C and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective.

Note: The outcome measures and time frames (previously) described in the PRS protocol record have been revised and articulated in the results section, to more accurately describe and represent the stated per-protocol investigations and endpoints, quantitatively.","A first-in-human, randomized pilot phase II clinical trial combining vaccines targeting overexpressed, non-mutated tumor blood vessel antigens (TBVA) and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib conducted in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2+ patients with advanced melanoma.

Patients were randomized into one of two treatment arms. All treated patients received an autologous alphaDC1/peptide vaccine administered by a single intradermal injection on days 1 and 15 of each monthly therapy cycle. The vaccine consisted of patient monocyte-derived type-1-polarized dendritic cells loaded with HLA-A2-presented peptides derived from TBVA (DLK1, EphA2, HBB, NRP1, RGS5, TEM1). Patients on Arm A started oral dasatinib (70 mg two times per day) on cycle 2, day 1 (week 5), while patients on Arm B began dasatinib administration on cycle 1, day 1 (week 1). Dasatinib was included as an immune adjuvant/conditioning agent intended to promote superior expansion and recruitment of therapeutic T cells, reduce tumor hypoxia and immunosuppressive cells, and extend overall survival. Primary endpoints included patient peripheral blood T cell response to vaccine peptides based on interferon-gamma ELISPOT analyses. Secondary endpoints included safety, objective clinical response (RECIST V.1.1), progression-free survival, and overall survival.",,,,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,True,False,True,False,False,False

* ECOG performance status ≤ 2 (Karnofsky ≥ 60%, see Appendix A).
* Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.
* Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:
