The primary study hypotheses are that pembrolizumab prolongs Overall Survival (OS) compared to paclitaxel and that pembrolizumab prolongs Progression-free Survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) assessed by blinded central radiologists' review compared to paclitaxel.","KEYNOTE-063 is a randomized, open-label, phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab compared with paclitaxel as a second-line therapy in Asian patients with advanced, PD-L1-positive (combined positive score ≥1) gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer.

Enrollment in the extension study will be conditional on participant consent. Treatment with pembrolizumab or paclitaxel will continue until documented disease progression, unacceptable adverse event(s), intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, investigator's decision to discontinue the participant, participant withdraws consent, pregnancy of the participant, participant receives 35 administrations (approximately 2 years) of pembrolizumab, or administrative reasons requiring cessation of treatment.","This study investigated pembrolizumab versus paclitaxel in Asian patients with advanced programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)–positive gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer who had experienced disease progression during or after first-line therapy containing any platinum/fluoropyrimidine doublet chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 200 mg of pembrolizumab intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 2 years (35 cycles) or 80 mg/m2 of paclitaxel intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 4-week cycle. Stratification factors included time to progression on first-line therapy (<6 vs ≥6 months) and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1). The primary end points were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 and safety.
