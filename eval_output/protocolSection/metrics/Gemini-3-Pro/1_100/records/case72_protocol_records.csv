Gemini-3-Pro,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,TP,FP,"This randomized phase II trial is studying how well carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab work when given with or without everolimus in treating patients with malignant melanoma that has spread from where it started to other places in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy given together with bevacizumab is more effective with or without everolimus in treating patients with metastatic melanoma.","This study evaluated the prognostic significance of detectable circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) BRAFV600E/K mutations in patients with advanced melanoma. Utilizing samples from the North Central Cancer Treatment Group/Alliance N0879 randomized phase 2 clinical trial, researchers compared BRAF mutation status in archived tissue against pretreatment stored plasma. The study aimed to determine if the presence of detectable cfDNA mutations correlates with Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) in a population receiving chemotherapy without BRAF-targeted therapy.",False,0.35,success,BriefSummary,protocolSection.descriptionModule.briefSummary,False,True,True,False,False,False
Gemini-3-Pro,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,TP,FP,"OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To assess whether there is sufficient promise of an impact of the addition of everolimus to the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab on progression-free survival that it would be recommended for further testing in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma.

Secondary

* To estimate the confirmed tumor response rate of each of the treatment regimens.
* To estimate the distribution of overall survival (OS) time for each of the treatment regimens.
* To assess the impact on the safety profile of the addition of everolimus to the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to elevated LDH (above upper limit of normal) at baseline (yes vs no), location of metastatic disease (M1a \[skin, subcutaneous tissue, or lymph node only\] vs M1b \[lung\] vs M1c \[other visceral sites\]) and prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

ARM I: Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15, paclitaxel IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

ARM II: Patients receive bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin as in Arm I. Patients also receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) 3 times weekly. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for up to 5 years.","The study population consisted of 149 patients with unresectable stage IV melanoma enrolled in the NCCTG N0879 trial between May 2010 and May 2014. The original trial assessed a regimen of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab with or without everolimus. In this retrospective analysis, BRAFV600E/K mutation status was established using archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue via a 50-gene hotspot PCR-based MiSeq panel. This was compared to cfDNA extracted from stored frozen plasma samples using a validated digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) assay on the RainDrop Digital PCR System.

The analysis focused on the concordance between tissue and plasma results, reporting sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Furthermore, the study assessed the prognostic implications of cfDNA status by analyzing Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) using the Kaplan-Meier method. The study specifically investigated whether detectable cfDNA BRAFV600E/K mutations in patients with tissue-diagnosed mutant BRAF were associated with poorer clinical outcomes.",False,0.64,success,DetailedDescription,protocolSection.descriptionModule.detailedDescription,False,True,True,False,False,False
