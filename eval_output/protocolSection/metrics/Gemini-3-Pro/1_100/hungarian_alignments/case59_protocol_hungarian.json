The scale has 2 sub-scales: autonomous and controlled motivation. Calculating the scores for the sub-scales will consist of averaging the items on that subscale. They are:\n\nAutonomous Regulation: 2, 3, 7, 10, 13, 16, 18, 19. Scores for Autonomous Regulation can range from 8 to 56. High scores indicate high autonomous motivation or intrinsic motivation for behavior engagement.\n\nControlled Regulation: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17. Scores for Controlled Regulation can range from 8 to 56. High scores indicate high controlled motivation or extrinsic motivation for behavior engagement.\n\nScoring for RAI will consist of subtracting the average for Controlled Regulation from the average for Autonomous Regulation. Higher RAI scores indicate higher autonomous or intrinsic motivation for behavior engagement.",
