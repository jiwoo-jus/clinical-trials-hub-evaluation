This study will focus on screening children ages 0-5, in line with the partnering FQHC's ACEs screening priorities. The implementation strategy components are: 1) video-trainings for clinic personnel (care team staff and providers); 2) technical implementation support to increase inner context capacity, 3) use of a validated clinical screening tool - Pediatric Symptoms Checklist (PSC-17), used in pediatric settings to assess behavioral and social/emotional development. For this study, we use the PSC tools that are tailored to children ages 0 to 5 years old with the Baby Pediatric Symptomatology Checklist (BPSC) for ages 0 to 18 months, and the Preschool Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PPSC) for ages 18 to 60 months. This screening tool is needed as the PEARLS only assesses ACEs exposure; and 4) use of a technology-based tailored ACEs algorithm that incorporates multiple data sources.",
