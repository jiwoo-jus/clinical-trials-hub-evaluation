C\\&A-GTS-QOL contains 6 subscales (cognitive, coprophenomena, psychological, physical, obsessive-compulsive, and ADL) and uses a 5-point Likert scale ranging from no problem to extreme problem. Following 3 questions from 27-item questionnaire were assessed in ADL C\\&A-GTS-QOL subscale: Question 2 (Had difficulty with school or sport activities?), 24 (Felt you needed more help or support from other people?), and 26 (Had difficulty going out with other people?). Total score of ADL subscale ranged from 0 (no problem) to 12 (extreme problem). Lower score indicated better quality of life. LS mean and SE was calculated using MMRM with treatment group, week (3 levels: Weeks 2, 4, and 8), and treatment group by week interaction as fixed effects; and baseline TTS, region, and age group at baseline (2 levels: 6-11 years, 12-16 years) as covariates.",
