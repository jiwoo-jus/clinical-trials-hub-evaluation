The main question is whether these commonly used uterotonic drugs differ in their impact on the heart, as measured by changes in high‑sensitivity troponin I levels 6–10 hours after drug administration. About 240 women aged 18–50 years will be enrolled at three Norwegian hospitals. Besides myocardial injury markers, the study will assess uterine tone, blood loss, need for rescue uterotonics, adverse events, postoperative pain (in a sub‑study), and direct/indirect healthcare costs, to help inform safer choices for prevention of postpartum haemorrhage."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This is a multicentre, randomized, patient‑ and investigator‑blinded, parallel‑group Phase 4 clinical trial conducted at three obstetric units at Oslo University Hospital and Akershus University Hospital in Norway. It is a follow‑on confirmatory study to a 40‑patient pilot trial that indicated smaller increases in high‑sensitivity troponin I after carbetocin 100 µg compared with oxytocin 2.5 IU during elective caesarean delivery, with the largest difference seen at 10 hours post‑dose.\n\nThe trial enrols approximately 240 pregnant women, aged 18–50 years, with a normal singleton pregnancy at ≥36 weeks’ gestation, scheduled for planned caesarean delivery, and able to read and understand Norwegian. Women with common comorbidities such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and pregnancies after in vitro fertilization are eligible. Exclusion criteria include placenta praevia or invasive placenta, pre‑eclampsia, bleeding disorders (e.g. von Willebrand disease type I), treatment with low‑molecular‑weight heparin or other anticoagulants (except aspirin), known intolerance to the study drugs, prolonged QT interval or serious cardiac disease, liver or kidney failure, epilepsy, or other medical reasons deemed by the investigator. ECG is not systematically used as a screening tool.\n\nParticipants are randomized 1:1 via a computer‑generated sequence implemented in the electronic case report form system (Viedoc), using permuted blocks of varying sizes. Study drugs are prepared by unblinded staff otherwise not involved in the trial, diluted to 5 mL in normal saline, and labelled only with the trial identification and randomization number to ensure masking. The administering anaesthetist, the patient, and outcome assessors are blinded. Blinding adequacy is assessed for investigators.\n\nAt caesarean delivery under standardized spinal anaesthesia and haemodynamic management, women receive a single 1‑minute intravenous injection of either oxytocin 2.5 IU (Syntocinon®) or carbetocin 100 µg (Pabal®) immediately after delivery of the baby’s head and shoulders. These doses and injection times reflect routine practice at the centres and are consistent with guideline recommendations (oxytocin up to 3 IU or carbetocin up to 100 µg administered over more than 30 seconds). All caesarean sections use standardized surgical techniques including Pfannenstiel incision and uterus exteriorization according to local guidelines.\n\nThe prespecified primary endpoint is the between‑group difference in change from baseline in high‑sensitivity troponin I plasma concentration measured 6–10 hours after study drug administration. Blood is sampled before caesarean delivery and again between 6 and 10 hours after dosing. Plasma is stored at −70 °C and analysed in batch at the end of the study using a high‑sensitivity chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (Alinity i®, Abbott). The assay’s lower limit of detection is 0.1 ng/L; values below this are recorded as 0 ng/L. Existing literature suggests a female 99th percentile upper reference limit for high‑sensitivity troponin I of approximately 15 ng/L, but the study is designed to detect very small changes around these low baseline values in young, mostly healthy women.\n\nKey secondary outcomes include:\n- Uterine tone at 2.5 and 5 minutes after study drug administration, measured on a 0–10 numerical rating scale where 0 = no tonus, 10 = maximal tonus, 7 = clinically satisfactory tonus, and ≤6 correlates with need for rescue treatment. Obstetricians are instructed in use of this scale; prior work shows good inter‑rater reliability.\n- Intraoperative blood loss estimated by suction and swab volume and calculated blood loss based on peri‑operative haematocrit, height, and weight.\n- Need for uterotonic rescue therapy (timing, doses, and types of additional agents such as extra oxytocin, methylergometrine, prostaglandins, or surgical/mechanical interventions).\n- Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) up to 48 hours post‑delivery, graded according to CTCAE v4.0. Expected AEs include flushing, feeling of warmth, chest pain, dyspnoea, palpitations, headache, nasal congestion, dry mouth, metallic taste, hypotension, and tachycardia.\n- Vital signs (including invasive/non‑invasive blood pressure and heart rate) monitored during surgery; standard neonatal outcomes (Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes, umbilical cord acid–base status).\n- Direct and indirect healthcare costs, including drug costs (oxytocin, carbetocin and rescue uterotonics), management of blood loss and side effects, transfusions, and staff time in theatre and in the post‑anaesthesia care unit.\n\nA predefined sub‑study at one centre will assess postoperative pain in 80 women over the first 48 hours after delivery, recording pain scores (0–10 numerical rating scale) and opioid consumption in the context of standardized multimodal analgesia and patient‑controlled intravenous morphine. This aims to explore whether the choice of uterotonic agent influences postpartum pain experience.\n\nRescue uterotonic therapy for uterine atony consists of intravenous oxytocin 1 IU every 2 minutes up to a maximum of 5 IU, in addition to the allocated study drug. If uterine tone remains inadequate, further uterotonic treatment (e.g. oxytocin infusion, methylergometrine, prostaglandins, misoprostol) and/or surgical or mechanical measures are provided per departmental protocols. All concomitant medications, including anaesthetic agents, vasopressors (phenylephrine, ephedrine), fluids, and analgesics (paracetamol, NSAIDs, ketorolac, oxycodone), are recorded.\n\nThe sample size was derived from pilot data, where change from baseline troponin I at 10 hours was 0.41 ± 0.79 ng/L in the carbetocin group and 1.78 ± 4.48 ng/L in the oxytocin group. Assuming an absolute between‑group difference in mean change of 1.37 ng/L, 80% power, and a two‑sample t‑test with unequal variances at a 5% significance level, 178 patients (89 per group) are required. To allow for missing data and dropouts, 240 women will be enrolled. The primary analysis population is a modified intention‑to‑treat cohort including all randomized women who receive study drug. A per‑protocol definition and further sensitivity analyses are pre‑specified in a separate statistical analysis plan (SAP).\n\nContinuous endpoints with baseline and follow‑up measurements are analysed using linear regression models with follow‑up value as the dependent variable and treatment group plus baseline value as covariates, estimating between‑group differences in change with 95% confidence intervals. Skewed distributions and non‑normal residuals will be addressed by using median regression with bootstrap‑based standard errors and confidence intervals. Single‑time‑point continuous variables will be compared with two‑sample t‑tests or median regression, as appropriate. Binary outcomes will be analysed using Fisher mid‑P tests with Newcombe hybrid score confidence intervals; ordered categorical variables (e.g. uterine tone scores) will be analysed with proportional odds (Wilcoxon‑Mann‑Whitney) methods.\n\nThe primary endpoint will also be examined in a prespecified sub‑population of women who receive their allocated study drug without requiring rescue treatment for uterine atony, to explore the effect of oxytocin versus carbetocin uncontaminated by additional oxytocin dosing. Troponin I results are analysed in batch only after the last participant has completed follow‑up, so perioperative patient care and rescue treatment decisions are not influenced by troponin data.\n\nThe trial adheres to ICH‑GCP and the Declaration of Helsinki, with approval from the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics, the Norwegian Medicines Agency, and institutional data protection authorities. All participants provide written informed consent. The study aims to clarify whether carbetocin and oxytocin differ in their potential to induce perioperative myocardial injury in women undergoing caesarean delivery, information that is particularly relevant for women with existing or future cardiovascular risk, and to balance any incremental myocardial risk against the benefits of preventing postpartum haemorrhage.""}","{""conditions"": [""Caesarean Section"", ""Postpartum Hemorrhage"", ""Uterine Atony"", ""Perioperative Myocardial Injury"", ""Myocardial Ischemia"", ""Pregnancy"", ""Postpartum Period""], ""keywords"": [""Oxytocin"", ""Carbetocin"", ""Uterotonic Agents"", ""High-Sensitivity Troponin I"", ""Cardiac Troponin"", ""Myocardial Injury"", ""Myocardial Ischemia"", ""Cesarean Section"", ""Elective Cesarean Delivery"", ""Uterine Atony"", ""Postpartum Hemorrhage Prevention"", ""Haemodynamic Effects"", ""QT Interval"", ""Arrhythmia"", ""Postoperative Pain"", ""Adverse Events"", ""Rescue Uterotonic Therapy"", ""Spinal Anaesthesia"", ""Blood Loss"", ""Health Care Costs""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""PHASE4""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Parallel-group, randomized, patient- and investigator-blinded Phase 4 trial comparing a single IV dose of oxytocin 2.5 IU vs carbetocin 100 µg given over 1 minute at elective caesarean delivery."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""PREVENTION"", ""observationalModel"": ""NA"", ""timePerspective"": ""NA"", ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Patient- and investigator-blinded.

During controlled, insulin-induced hypoglycemia in an inpatient setting, 170 adults with type 1 diabetes were randomized 2:1:1 to dasiglucagon, placebo, or reconstituted lyophilized glucagon. The main outcome was how long it took for blood glucose to rise by at least 20 mg/dL after dosing without needing intravenous glucose. Dasiglucagon significantly shortened time to glucose recovery compared with placebo and showed similar efficacy and safety to standard reconstituted glucagon, with nausea and vomiting as the most common side effects. The ready-to-use aqueous formulation is intended to overcome practical barriers associated with current glucagon emergency kits that require reconstitution."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial investigated the efficacy and safety of dasiglucagon, a next-generation glucagon analog formulated as a ready-to-use aqueous solution for subcutaneous injection, for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in adults with type 1 diabetes. Dasiglucagon is a 29–amino acid peptide with seven substitutions relative to native glucagon to enhance physical and chemical stability in aqueous media, enabling storage and administration without reconstitution.\n\nAdults aged 18–75 years with type 1 diabetes, HbA1c <10%, and on stable insulin therapy were enrolled. Key exclusions included prior dasiglucagon exposure, allergy to trial products, recent severe hypoglycemia (within 1 month) or hypoglycemia with seizure (within 1 year), and use of certain concomitant medications (e.g., β-blockers, indomethacin, warfarin, anticholinergics). Participants underwent an inpatient dosing visit during which insulin-induced hypoglycemia was generated using an intravenous insulin glulisine infusion adjusted to produce a controlled decline in plasma glucose to a target of approximately 55 mg/dL.\n\nA total of 170 participants were randomized 2:1:1 to receive a single subcutaneous dose of either 0.6 mg dasiglucagon, placebo, or 1.0 mg reconstituted lyophilized glucagon (GlucaGen) during controlled hypoglycemia. Randomization was stratified by injection site (abdomen, buttocks, or thigh) and used a fixed-block scheme. Because the investigational medications differed in appearance, preparation and administration were performed by unblinded staff not involved in assessments; participants and investigators remained blinded.\n\nThe primary endpoint was the time from dosing to plasma glucose recovery, defined as the first increase in plasma glucose of at least 20 mg/dL (1.1 mmol/L) from baseline (time of injection) without the need for rescue intravenous glucose; participants not achieving recovery within 45 minutes or requiring rescue glucose were considered nonrecovered. A supportive analysis used linear interpolation between sampling time points to estimate the true time of achieving a 20 mg/dL rise. Key secondary endpoints included the proportion of participants achieving plasma glucose recovery within fixed time windows (10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes) and the change in plasma glucose from baseline at those time points. Statistical analyses included Kaplan–Meier methods and stratified log-rank tests for time-to-event outcomes and ANCOVA for continuous glucose changes, with a hierarchical testing strategy to control multiplicity.\n\nAmong 168 treated participants (82 dasiglucagon, 43 placebo, 43 glucagon), baseline demographics and diabetes characteristics were similar across groups. Median time to plasma glucose recovery was 10 minutes (95% CI 10, 10) with dasiglucagon versus 40 minutes (95% CI 30, 40) with placebo (P < 0.001); the reference glucagon product showed a median recovery time of 12 minutes (95% CI 10, 12). Using interpolated times, median recovery was 9.0 minutes for dasiglucagon, 33.7 minutes for placebo, and 10.0 minutes for glucagon. A high proportion of dasiglucagon-treated participants recovered rapidly: 65%, 99%, and 99% recovered within 10, 15, and 20 minutes, respectively. These rates were significantly superior to placebo at all evaluated time points and comparable to reconstituted glucagon (49%, 95%, and 98% at 10, 15, and 20 minutes). Rescue intravenous glucose was not required in any dasiglucagon or glucagon recipients but was needed in 16% of placebo-treated participants.\n\nDasiglucagon produced a rapid and robust increase in plasma glucose. Mean plasma glucose rise from baseline at 30 minutes was approximately 90.9 mg/dL with dasiglucagon versus 19.1 mg/dL with placebo and 88.5 mg/dL with glucagon. Injection site (abdomen, buttock, thigh) did not significantly affect time to recovery.\n\nSafety assessments demonstrated that dasiglucagon was generally well tolerated with a profile similar to reconstituted glucagon. The most common adverse events judged related to study drug were nausea, vomiting, and headache, occurring with comparable frequency in the dasiglucagon and glucagon groups. Nausea typically began 1–3 hours after dosing and resolved within about 3 hours; vomiting occurred later (mostly 2–3 hours postdose) and was also transient. Injection-site reactions were infrequent, mild, and transient. No serious or fatal adverse events occurred. Antidrug antibody assessments revealed that one dasiglucagon-treated participant developed low-titer, nonneutralizing, non–cross-reactive antibodies at 28 days, which were no longer detectable at 17 months.\n\nThe trial demonstrates that subcutaneous dasiglucagon at 0.6 mg provides rapid and effective reversal of insulin-induced hypoglycemia in adults with type 1 diabetes, with efficacy comparable to reconstituted glucagon and a similar safety and tolerability profile. Because dasiglucagon is supplied as a stable, ready-to-use aqueous formulation that does not require reconstitution, it may mitigate important real-world barriers to glucagon use, such as the complexity and delay associated with conventional emergency glucagon kits. The authors highlight that, although this trial was conducted under controlled inpatient conditions, the combination of ready-to-use formulation and rapid glucose recovery suggests that dasiglucagon has the potential to improve real-world management of severe hypoglycemia and reduce the need for emergency medical care.""}","{""conditions"": [""Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus"", ""Hypoglycemia"", ""Severe Hypoglycemia"", ""Insulin-Induced Hypoglycemia""], ""keywords"": [""Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus"", ""Severe Hypoglycemia"", ""Hypoglycemia"", ""Insulin-Induced Hypoglycemia"", ""Glucagon"", ""Dasiglucagon"", ""Glucagon Analog"", ""Subcutaneous Injection"", ""Ready-to-Use Formulation"", ""Aqueous Formulation"", ""Rescue Therapy"", ""Plasma Glucose Recovery""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE3""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial with three arms (dasiglucagon, placebo, reconstituted glucagon) in adults with type 1 diabetes undergoing controlled insulin-induced hypoglycemia."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Double-blind: participants and investigators responsible for trial procedures and assessments were blinded.

Participants are randomly assigned to receive either an Apple Watch Series 6, which includes heart rate tracking, irregular rhythm notifications, single‑lead ECG, and pulse oximetry, or a Withings Move, which tracks activity and sleep but does not provide cardiopulmonary measurements. Using a patient‑centered data platform (Hugo) to collect electronic health records, device data, and surveys, the trial aims to determine whether the advanced cardiopulmonary features of the Apple Watch affect patients’ quality of life and healthcare use over 12 months. The main hypothesis is that use of the Apple Watch features will lead to a different (potentially improved) atrial fibrillation–related quality of life at 6 months compared with a control device, and that it may also influence healthcare utilization and the accuracy of rhythm and oxygen saturation measurements in routine care."", ""detailedDescription"": ""The Heart Watch Study is a pragmatic, prospective, open‑label, multicenter randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the clinical impact of consumer wearable technology in patients with atrial fibrillation and/or atrial flutter. The trial specifically focuses on cardiopulmonary features of the Apple Watch Series 6, including continuous heart rate monitoring, irregular rhythm notification algorithms, on‑demand single‑lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and pulse oximetry, and compares these to a control wearable (Withings Move) that provides activity and sleep tracking but no ECG, rhythm notification, or oxygen saturation measurements.\n\nA total of 150 adult participants (age >22 years) with a history of atrial fibrillation and/or atrial flutter who are scheduled for direct current cardioversion are enrolled across three U.S. academic health systems: Yale New Haven Health, Mayo Clinic, and Duke Health. Participants must own a compatible iPhone, live independently, be English‑speaking, receive cardiology care at one of the study centers, and have primary care at a health system that can be connected to the Hugo Health platform. After informed consent, subjects are randomized 1:1, stratified by site, to receive either an Apple Watch Series 6 (GPS) or a Withings Move. They are asked to wear only the assigned device as much as possible during the study period, aside from charging or unsuitable environments.\n\nThe primary outcome is the change in the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy-of-life (AFEQT) global score from baseline to 6 months. AFEQT is a validated, 20‑item, atrial fibrillation–specific health‑related quality‑of‑life instrument that yields an overall score (0–100) from domains of symptoms, daily activities, and treatment concern; higher scores represent better quality of life, and a change of approximately 5 points is considered clinically meaningful.\n\nSecondary outcomes encompass three domains: (1) additional patient‑reported outcomes, (2) healthcare utilization, and (3) device‑specific performance metrics in the Apple Watch arm.\n\nPatient‑reported secondary outcomes include: longitudinal changes in AFEQT global and domain scores at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 12 months; anticoagulation persistence at multiple time points (assessed using items adapted from the Brief Medication Questionnaire); continued or discontinued use of the assigned wearable and any use of other personal digital devices; patient responses to abnormal or worrisome device notifications, including whether they contacted a clinician and what occurred; and patients’ technology experience and their feelings of reassurance or anxiety regarding overall health and atrial fibrillation, as well as confidence in engaging in physical and usual activities. Apple Watch users are additionally queried about the frequency of notifications and use of the ECG function to evaluate heart rhythm during symptoms.\n\nHealthcare utilization outcomes are assessed using aggregated electronic health record data accessed and shared by participants through the Hugo platform. Four composite endpoints are evaluated at 6 and 12 months: (1) rhythm control intervention (additional cardioversion, initiation or dose escalation of antiarrhythmic medication, switching to a different antiarrhythmic agent, or atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter ablation); (2) acute care utilization (emergency department visits, observation stays, and hospitalizations); (3) outpatient care utilization (primary care visits, cardiology/electrophysiology visits, and scheduled telephone encounters); and (4) rhythm‑related diagnostic testing (number of 12‑lead ECGs and ambulatory rhythm monitoring studies). These comparisons are designed to determine whether the Apple Watch’s cardiopulmonary features are associated with increased or decreased healthcare use relative to the control device.\n\nAmong Apple Watch recipients, the study also evaluates technical performance. Investigators will count irregular rhythm notifications and high‑ and low‑heart‑rate alerts. Apple Watch single‑lead ECG tracings (10‑second, high‑quality, low‑artifact recordings) are compared with near‑simultaneous 12‑lead ECGs obtained in routine care, ideally within 30 minutes, to assess agreement in rhythm classification, heart rate, and ECG intervals (PR, QRS, QT), including inter‑ and intra‑observer reliability. In addition, Apple Watch pulse oximetry readings are compared with standard medical‑grade pulse oximeter measurements collected during clinical encounters, with paired values entered into study surveys when coordinators are present.\n\nData capture is mediated through the Hugo patient‑centered health data sharing platform, which aggregates electronic health records from multiple health systems using Blue Button and application programming interfaces, as well as personal device data (Apple HealthKit or Withings Health Mate), pharmacy information, and Medicare claims when available. Hugo also delivers and collects digital patient‑reported outcome measures via secure links sent by text or email, thereby enabling decentralized follow‑up without traditional in‑person study visits. Importantly, data are shared voluntarily by participants with the research team and are not drawn directly from health systems; study investigators do not monitor these data in real time for clinical care, and participants are instructed to seek standard medical attention for concerning symptoms.\n\nThe sample size of 150 participants (75 per arm) provides 80% power, at a two‑sided alpha of 0.05, to detect a differential change of 8.8 points in the AFEQT global score at 6 months between the Apple Watch and control arms, accounting for an anticipated 8% rate of missing 6‑month AFEQT data. Statistical analysis plans include use of t‑tests (or non‑parametric alternatives) to compare continuous outcomes (AFEQT scores and utilization composites) between groups, and intraclass correlation coefficients for ECG agreement metrics. For missing patient‑reported outcomes, the last observation will be carried forward; for utilization outcomes, analyses will include only periods with available connected data.\n\nThe trial is approved by institutional review boards at Yale University, Mayo Clinic, and Duke University Health System. Given the low‑risk nature of consumer wearable devices, a formal data safety monitoring board was not convened. Device‑related adverse events, if any, will be reported to the FDA’s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. The study is registered as NCT04468321.\n\nOverall, this trial is intended to provide independent evidence on how widely used wearable technologies with cardiopulmonary features affect disease‑specific quality of life, healthcare utilization, patient experience, and measurement accuracy among patients with atrial fibrillation and/or atrial flutter undergoing cardioversion. The findings may inform clinicians, patients, policymakers, regulators, and payers regarding labeling, risk mitigation, and coverage decisions for digital health technologies.""}","{""conditions"": [""Atrial Fibrillation"", ""Atrial Flutter"", ""Cardiomyopathies, Atrial Tachyarrhythmias (context: atrial tachyarrhythmias treatment and monitoring)""], ""keywords"": [""Atrial Fibrillation"", ""Atrial Flutter"", ""Tachyarrhythmias"", ""Cardioversion"", ""Electrocardiography"", ""Wearable Electronic Devices"", ""Smartwatch"", ""Apple Watch"", ""Withings Move"", ""Photoplethysmography"", ""Pulse Oximetry"", ""Remote Patient Monitoring"", ""Digital Health"", ""mHealth"", ""Quality of Life"", ""Patient-Reported Outcome Measures"", ""Healthcare Utilization"", ""Rhythm Control"", ""Antiarrhythmic Agents"", ""Catheter Ablation""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Prospective, open-label, multicentre, pragmatic randomized controlled trial with 1:1 allocation to Apple Watch Series 6 versus Withings Move at the time of cardioversion, with follow-up to 12 months."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Open-label design; participants and treating clinicians are aware of assigned device.

Thirty HCV RNA–positive donor to HCV-negative recipient kidney transplants were performed at seven U.S. centers, and recipients received an 8‑week course of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir starting 2–5 days after transplantation. The study also enrolled additional patients to compare the probability of undergoing kidney transplantation between MYTHIC participants who opted in to receive HCV-viremic kidneys and matched waitlisted comparators from the UNOS registry who did not. The main hypotheses were that accepting HCV-viremic kidneys would increase access to transplantation without compromising 1‑year outcomes, and that early DAA treatment would result in universal HCV cure with good graft function and acceptable rates of infectious and immunologic complications."", ""detailedDescription"": ""The Multicenter Study to Transplant Hepatitis C-Infected Kidneys (MYTHIC; NCT03781726) was a prospective, multicenter, open-label trial conducted at seven U.S. transplant centers. It was designed to assess both the virologic efficacy and the 1‑year clinical safety of transplanting kidneys from hepatitis C virus (HCV) viremic deceased donors into HCV-negative recipients (HCV donor RNA–positive/recipient–negative, abbreviated HCV D-RNA-positive/R-negative), and to quantify the impact of this strategy on access to kidney transplantation.\n\nEligible candidates were adults aged 21–65 years with end-stage kidney disease (on dialysis or estimated glomerular filtration rate <15 ml/min/1.73 m²), without HIV, hepatitis B virus infection, or known liver disease. Assessment for liver fibrosis was mandatory; candidates with liver stiffness >8 kPa by FibroScan were excluded. Donors had a kidney donor profile index (KDPI) ≤85% at allocation. All participants who consented to the trial were eligible to receive offers from HCV-viremic donors; 30 ultimately underwent HCV D-RNA-positive/R-negative kidney transplantation between April and October 2019. Additional enrolled patients either received kidneys from HCV antibody–positive/RNA-negative donors, underwent standard-of-care kidney transplantation, or remained on the waitlist.\n\nHCV D-RNA-positive/R-negative recipients received induction and maintenance immunosuppression and antiviral prophylaxis per local standard of care. Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P), a fixed-dose DAA combination, was initiated 2–5 days post-transplant and continued for 8 weeks. The primary virologic endpoint was HCV cure, defined as sustained virologic response at 12 weeks after completing G/P (SVR12). The protocol included serial measurements of HCV RNA and HCV antibody, as well as routine laboratory monitoring.\n\nFor the access-to-transplant analysis, all 63 consented MYTHIC patients (regardless of whether they actually received a transplant) were compared with matched waitlisted comparators from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) registry who did not opt in to receive HCV-viremic kidneys. Potential comparators were restricted to transplant-naïve adults 21–65 years with panel-reactive antibodies <80%, no cancer history, and no consent for HCV-viremic donor kidneys. Matching incorporated race, diabetes status, blood group, obesity (BMI >35 kg/m²), dialysis status at listing, age, dialysis vintage, and center aggressiveness (standardized transplant ratio). A competing risk framework (transplant vs. death) was used to estimate 1‑year cumulative incidence of deceased donor kidney transplantation, with robust variance methods to account for matching.\n\nPrespecified 1‑year post-transplant outcomes for the 30 HCV D-RNA-positive/R-negative recipients included: sustained virologic response and HCV RNA status up to 24 weeks post-G/P; HCV antibody dynamics; graft function (serum creatinine, estimated GFR, and proteinuria); biopsy-proven acute rejection; serious adverse events; liver biochemistry; BK polyomavirus (BKV) viremia; cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia and CMV disease; and overall and graft survival. BKV and CMV testing followed each center’s standard-of-care, and all episodes of detectable CMV were adjudicated by an expert transplant infectious disease physician as no, probable, or definite CMV disease using standard definitions.\n\nAmong 63 enrolled MYTHIC participants, 30 received HCV-viremic kidneys, 4 received HCV antibody–positive/RNA-negative kidneys, 8 received standard-of-care kidneys, and 21 remained on the waitlist. A close match in UNOS was found for 58 MYTHIC patients, yielding 2055 matched comparators. The 1‑year cumulative probability of receiving any kidney transplant (with death as a competing risk) was 68% (95% CI: 57–81%) in the MYTHIC cohort versus 19% (14–27%) in the matched UNOS comparators, and median time from consent to transplant was substantially shorter in MYTHIC (8.0 vs. 25.4 weeks).\n\nAll 30 HCV D-RNA-positive/R-negative recipients developed post-transplant HCV viremia, started G/P early postoperatively, and achieved SVR12. HCV RNA remained undetectable when measured between 32 and 52 weeks after transplantation, confirming durable virologic cure. At baseline, 28/30 recipients were HCV antibody–negative; many developed transient detectable antibody within 4 weeks post-transplant, but by 1 year only a small minority remained antibody-positive, suggesting donor-derived antibody rather than persistent recipient antibody production.\n\nClinical outcomes at 1 year were favorable. One-year patient survival for HCV D-RNA-positive/R-negative recipients was 93% (28/30), with both deaths occurring after successful HCV cure and not attributed to study participation (one from Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and multiorgan failure in the context of CMV infection, and one presumed cardiac death at home). All surviving HCV D-RNA-positive/R-negative recipients and all recipients of HCV antibody–positive/RNA-negative or standard-of-care kidneys had functioning grafts at 1 year. Median serum creatinine among surviving HCV D-RNA-positive/R-negative recipients was 1.17 mg/dl (IQR 1.02–1.38), with median estimated GFR of 60.0 ml/min/1.73 m² (IQR 51.4–80.8) and low urine protein-to-creatinine ratios (median 0.14, range 0.03–0.64). There were three cases of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection; no cases of de novo glomerulonephritis or HCV-related kidney injury were reported.\n\nLiver biochemistry remained reassuring throughout follow-up: no grade 3 transaminase elevations were observed, and transient alanine aminotransferase elevations (>100 U/L) were limited to the early post-transplant period or episodes of CMV viremia. All survivors had normal liver tests at 1 year, and no clinically significant liver disease, including fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, was observed, consistent with the early initiation of DAAs.\n\nInfectious complications were carefully characterized. BKV viremia occurred in 5 of 30 HCV D-RNA-positive/R-negative recipients (17%), with most episodes at low to moderate viral loads; immunosuppression was reduced in three cases, and no biopsy-proven BK nephropathy or significant graft dysfunction was reported. CMV viremia was detected in 10 recipients, with five patients (all CMV donor-positive/recipient-negative) experiencing viral loads >1000 IU/ml. Among 10 CMV D+/R− recipients (who received 6 months of valganciclovir prophylaxis), five developed significant viremia after prophylaxis cessation; four were adjudicated as having probable or definite CMV disease. The observed rate of definite CMV disease in this high-risk subgroup (~20%) was similar to that reported in prior valganciclovir prophylaxis trials, although the sample size was small.\n\nOverall, the MYTHIC trial demonstrates that in carefully selected HCV-negative kidney transplant candidates without significant liver fibrosis, accepting kidneys from HCV-viremic donors and initiating G/P within the first postoperative week yields 100% HCV cure, excellent 1‑year graft function, and acceptable rates of infectious and immunologic complications.

Participants were randomized 3:1 to receive a single dose of either V114 or PCV13, followed 6 months later by a single dose of the 23‑valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). The study assessed adverse events and serious adverse events after each vaccination, and measured functional antibody responses (opsonophagocytic activity) and IgG concentrations to pneumococcal serotypes included in V114, PCV13, and PPSV23. The main objective was to determine whether V114, alone and when followed by PPSV23, is well tolerated and elicits robust immune responses, including to serotypes 22F and 33F that are not contained in PCV13, in at‑risk and not‑at‑risk adults."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double‑blind, active comparator–controlled study (protocol V114‑017; NCT03547167; EudraCT 2017‑004915‑38) investigated the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V114, a 15‑valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, in immunocompetent adults aged 18–49 years who were pneumococcal vaccine‑naive. Participants could have predefined medical or behavioral risk factors for pneumococcal disease (PD), such as chronic heart, liver, or lung disease, diabetes mellitus, current tobacco use, and higher alcohol consumption; adults without risk factors were enrolled at specific American Indian health sites.\n\nApproximately 1500 participants were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive a single intramuscular dose of V114 or PCV13 on Day 1, followed 6 months later by an open‑label dose of PPSV23. V114 contains 13 serotypes shared with PCV13 (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23F) plus 2 additional serotypes, 22F and 33F, which have become important causes of invasive pneumococcal disease following widespread use of earlier conjugate vaccines. PPSV23 contains 23 pneumococcal polysaccharide serotypes, including all 15 V114 serotypes and additional serotypes not included in conjugate vaccines.\n\nThe trial was designed as a descriptive immunogenicity and safety study and was not powered to demonstrate formal statistical differences between V114 and PCV13. Randomization was stratified by site (American Indian health sites vs non‑American Indian sites), by type and number of predefined PD risk factors, and by higher alcohol use defined by an AUDIT‑C score ≥5.\n\nSafety assessments included solicited injection‑site and systemic adverse events (AEs) recorded by participants on Vaccination Report Cards after each dose, as well as non‑solicited AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), and deaths from consent through study end. Injection‑site AEs were collected for days 1–5 and systemic AEs for days 1–14 after each vaccination. Severity was graded according to FDA toxicity criteria for preventive vaccine trials. All injection‑site AEs were considered related to vaccine; investigators assessed causality for systemic AEs.\n\nImmunogenicity was assessed in a per‑protocol population using blood samples at Day 1 (prevaccination with PCV), Day 30 (30 days after V114 or PCV13), Month 6 (prevaccination with PPSV23), and Month 7 (30 days after PPSV23). Functional antibody responses were measured as serotype‑specific opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) geometric mean titers (GMTs) using a validated multiplexed microcolony assay, and serotype‑specific IgG geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) were measured by a validated multiplex electrochemiluminescence assay. Primary immunogenicity endpoints were Day 30 OPA GMTs for all 15 serotypes in V114 within each vaccine group. Secondary endpoints included IgG GMCs at Day 30, OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs at Months 6 and 7, geometric mean fold rises, and proportions of participants with ≥4‑fold rises in OPA or IgG from pre‑ to post‑vaccination timepoints. Exploratory analyses compared V114 and PCV13 responses via constrained longitudinal data analysis models.\n\nMost participants experienced at least one solicited AE after V114 or PCV13 and after PPSV23, primarily mild and transient injection‑site pain and fatigue. The proportions and patterns of AEs, including SAEs, were similar between V114 and PCV13 recipients, and between groups after PPSV23. No vaccine‑related deaths and no vaccine‑related discontinuations were reported.\n\nImmunologically, both V114 and PCV13 induced robust OPA and IgG responses 30 days after vaccination for all serotypes contained in each product. For the 13 shared serotypes, OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs were generally comparable between groups. As expected, V114 elicited strong responses to serotypes 22F and 33F, which are unique to V114 and epidemiologically important causes of invasive disease; responses to these serotypes were substantially higher in the V114 group than in the PCV13 group. Antibody levels declined between Day 30 and Month 6 but remained above baseline. After PPSV23 administration at Month 6, OPA and IgG responses increased again for all 15 serotypes in both prior‑PCV groups and were generally comparable between those primed with V114 vs PCV13, including for 22F and 33F. For some shared serotypes, post‑PPSV23 titers did not exceed the peak levels achieved after the initial conjugate vaccine dose, consistent with prior observations that PPSV23 does not always boost responses beyond high pre‑existing antibody levels.\n\nOverall, the study demonstrates that in immunocompetent, pneumococcal vaccine‑naive adults 18–49 years of age, including those with common medical and behavioral risk factors for PD and in Native American populations, V114 is well tolerated and immunogenic for all 15 vaccine serotypes. When followed 6 months later by PPSV23, safety remains acceptable and broad serotype‑specific immune responses are maintained or enhanced, supporting V114 as a strategy to extend serotype coverage beyond PCV13, particularly through inclusion of serotypes 22F and 33F.""}","{""conditions"": [""Pneumococcal Infections"", ""Streptococcus pneumoniae Infections"", ""Pneumococcal Disease"", ""Invasive Pneumococcal Disease""], ""keywords"": [""V114"", ""15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine"", ""PCV13"", ""Prevnar 13"", ""PPSV23"", ""23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine"", ""Pneumococcal Vaccines"", ""Streptococcus pneumoniae"", ""Pneumococcal disease"", ""Invasive pneumococcal disease"", ""Opsonophagocytic activity"", ""Immunogenicity"", ""Vaccine Safety"", ""Conjugate vaccines"", ""Polysaccharide vaccines"", ""Chronic heart disease"", ""Chronic liver disease"", ""Chronic lung disease"", ""Diabetes mellitus"", ""Smoking"", ""Tobacco use"", ""Alcoholism"", ""Alcohol use disorder"", ""At-risk adults"", ""Immunocompetent adults"", ""American Indian"", ""Native American"", ""Serotype 22F"", ""Serotype 33F"", ""Serotype 1"", ""Serotype 3"", ""Serotype 4"", ""Serotype 5"", ""Serotype 6A"", ""Serotype 6B"", ""Serotype 7F"", ""Serotype 9V"", ""Serotype 14"", ""Serotype 18C"", ""Serotype 19A"", ""Serotype 19F"", ""Serotype 23F""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE3""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled, parallel-group trial in which pneumococcal vaccine-naive immunocompetent adults aged 18–49 years were randomized 3:1 to receive a single dose of V114 or PCV13 on Day 1, followed 6 months later by open-label PPSV23."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""PREVENTION"", ""observationalModel"": ""COHORT"", ""timePerspective"": ""PROSPECTIVE"", ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""V114 and PCV13 were administered in a blinded fashion in a double-blind, active comparator-controlled design; PPSV23 was administered open-label 6 months later."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT"", ""INVESTIGATOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 1515, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""V114 → PPSV23"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Immunocompetent, pneumococcal vaccine–naive adults aged 18–49 years received a single 0.5 mL intramuscular dose of V114 (15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) on Day 1, followed by a single 0.5 mL intramuscular dose of PPSV23 (23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine) at Month 6."", ""interventionNames"": [""V114"", ""PPSV23""]}, {""label"": ""PCV13 → PPSV23"", ""type"": ""ACTIVE_COMPARATOR"", ""description"": ""Immunocompetent, pneumococcal vaccine–naive adults aged 18–49 years received a single 0.5 mL intramuscular dose of PCV13 (13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) on Day 1, followed by a single 0.5 mL intramuscular dose of PPSV23 (23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine) at Month 6."", ""interventionNames"": [""PCV13"", ""PPSV23""]}], ""interventions"": [{""type"": ""BIOLOGICAL"", ""name"": ""V114"", ""description"": ""V114 (VAXNEUVANCE) is a 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.

Immediate post-ablation CT scans were used to compare actual versus predicted ablation zones, and the resected specimens were examined histologically to determine whether complete tumor ablation (100% non-viable tumor cells by NADH staining) was achieved. Safety was assessed by monitoring the type, incidence, and severity of adverse events from anesthesia induction through early postoperative follow-up."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This was a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, multicenter clinical investigation of the Emprint™ microwave ablation system used via a percutaneous approach in adults with primary or metastatic lung tumors that were already scheduled for surgical resection. The main goal was to assess the accuracy (dose response) of a CT-based procedure planning application that predicts microwave ablation zone size and shape in lung tissue, and to correlate imaging-based results with histologic evidence of tumor destruction.\n\nPatients ≥18 years of age with either: (I) at least one pulmonary metastasis ≤3.0 cm in maximum diameter from a distant primary cancer, or (II) one primary lung cancer ≤3.0 cm in maximum diameter, and who were deemed operable candidates for surgical resection of the target tumor, were eligible. Additional requirements included at least 1 cm of tumor-free lung parenchyma between the target lesion and pleura or fissure, and willingness and ability to adhere to the protocol. Key exclusions included contraindications to surgery, prolonged chest infection, tumors abutting major central airways or vessels, tumors with pleural contact, tumors close to staple lines or metal objects, advanced emphysema, significant coagulopathy or inability to hold anticoagulation, pregnancy or breastfeeding, conflicting investigational study participation, presence of certain electronic implants, or intra-procedural findings that nullified eligibility.\n\nBefore the planned resection, subjects underwent CT-guided percutaneous microwave ablation of a single lung tumor using the Emprint™ Ablation System. A dedicated Emprint™ Procedure Planning Application was used as an adjunct to standard imaging. This software overlays a virtual predicted ablation zone on pre- or intra-procedure CT images based on lung-specific in vivo data relating power, time, and tissue type to ablation zone geometry. The physician used the application to prescribe an ablation dose (power and time) and to plan probe placement, including active and passive zones, to encompass the tumor with an intended margin while minimizing injury to normal lung.\n\nA single ablation was performed for each tumor using one antenna. After the ablation, the patient remained intubated on single-lung ventilation. An immediate post-ablation CT scan was obtained with the antenna still in position, and this imaging was used to estimate the actual ablation zone, as defined by ground-glass opacity. These images were reviewed by at least two independent, blinded board-certified radiologists. The ablation zone was measured in three orthogonal dimensions (width X, height Y, depth Z) and volume was calculated. The predicted values generated by the Emprint™ software were then compared to the actual CT-based measurements to assess the primary endpoint, dose response.\n\nThe primary endpoint (dose response) was defined as the percentage change between predicted and observed ablation zone dimensions and volume, calculated as 100 × (A − P)/P, where A represents actual CT measurements and P represents software-predicted values. Percentage differences were summarized for ablation zone width, height, depth, and volume, as well as for ablation zone shape parameters. This analysis was performed for the modified intent-to-treat population (subjects who underwent the ablation procedure and had analyzable imaging).\n\nAfter completion of imaging, patients proceeded to surgical resection (typically wedge resection) of the ablated lung tissue during the same operative session. Resected specimens were processed and evaluated at a single central pathology laboratory by blinded pathologists. Histologic assessment included standard Hematoxylin and Eosin staining and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen (NADH) viability staining. The key secondary endpoint, complete tumor ablation, was defined as 100% non-viable tumor cells on NADH staining. Secondary analyses categorized ablation status as complete ablation, incomplete ablation with positive margin, or incomplete ablation with delayed necrosis.\n\nSafety endpoints included the type, incidence, severity, and relatedness of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) from induction of anesthesia through the first postoperative follow-up. Events such as bleeding, pneumothorax, hemothorax, air leak, and respiratory complications were captured and graded according to CTCAE criteria. The study specifically differentiated device-related from procedure-related and unrelated events.\n\nNineteen subjects consented; 15 underwent ablation and surgical resection and completed the study. Primary and secondary endpoint data were available for 11 subjects due to missing or unreadable post-ablation CT scans or unavailable tumor in resected specimens. The cohort included both primary lung cancers and pulmonary metastases (primarily colorectal and renal primaries). Analysis of the primary endpoint showed that the Emprint™ software consistently overestimated the ablation zone; actual volumes measured on immediate post-ablation CT were substantially smaller than predicted. The mean percentage difference for ablation zone volume indicated that observed zones were markedly reduced relative to predictions. The authors highlight that this discrepancy may be largely explained by tissue shrinkage during microwave ablation, which is known to be considerable in lung parenchyma, and by the very early timing of post-ablation imaging.\n\nHistologically, complete ablation was confirmed in slightly more than half of evaluable tumors, with additional cases showing delayed necrosis or incomplete ablation. Some incomplete cases were attributed to technical issues such as suboptimal targeting or sampling errors when multiple lesions were resected. The study also notes that the requirement to limit ablations to a single activation and the need to preserve conditions favorable for surgery may have constrained the aggressiveness of ablation in some patients.\n\nIn terms of safety, no device-related adverse events were reported. Procedure-related AEs, including bleeding, pneumothorax, hemothorax, and minor respiratory events, were generally low grade and resolved without prolonged hospitalization. Several serious adverse events occurred but were determined to be not related or unlikely to be related to the ablation step. Overall, the study demonstrates that a percutaneous ablate-and-resect paradigm is feasible for lung tumors, provides insight into the performance of microwave ablation planning software, and underscores the importance of accounting for tissue shrinkage and optimal imaging timing when evaluating ablation zone prediction tools.""}","{""conditions"": [""Lung Neoplasms"", ""Lung Cancer"", ""Pulmonary Metastases"", ""Colorectal Neoplasms"", ""Kidney Neoplasms""], ""keywords"": [""Microwave Ablation"", ""Percutaneous Ablation"", ""Image-Guided Thermal Ablation"", ""Lung Neoplasms"", ""Primary Lung Cancer"", ""Pulmonary Metastases"", ""Ablate and Resect"", ""Emprint Ablation System"", ""Procedure Planning Software"", ""Computed Tomography"", ""Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation"", ""Treatment Margin"", ""NADH staining"", ""Histologic Complete Response"", ""Ground-Glass Opacity"", ""Thoracic Surgery""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""NON_RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""SINGLE_GROUP"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Prospective, single-arm, multicenter study in which all enrolled subjects with metastatic or primary lung tumors underwent percutaneous microwave ablation using the Emprint system followed by same-day surgical resection."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""DEVICE_FEASIBILITY"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""SINGLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Post-ablation CT images were reviewed by independent board-certified radiologists who were blinded to patient information and local site assessments."", ""whoMasked"": [""OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 15, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Percutaneous Microwave Ablation with Emprint System Followed by Surgical Resection"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Single-arm, prospective, non-randomized, multicenter study in which subjects with primary or metastatic lung tumors scheduled for surgical resection first underwent CT-guided percutaneous microwave ablation using the Emprint Ablation System.

The study enrolled 24 healthy Japanese men who were randomized in a double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, parallel‑group design to receive oral trazpiroben at doses of 10 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg (single dose on day 1, then twice daily on days 3–7) or placebo. Safety outcomes, blood and urine drug levels, and changes in serum prolactin (a marker of D2 receptor blockade) were measured. Results were compared descriptively with those from a prior similar study in healthy participants in the United States to assess potential ethnic differences in trazpiroben disposition and effects."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This was a phase I, randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, single‑ and multiple‑ascending dose, parallel‑group study designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of trazpiroben (TAK‑906) in healthy Japanese men. Trazpiroben is a novel, peripherally selective dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist under development for the chronic treatment of gastroparesis, a gastric motility disorder characterized by delayed gastric emptying and symptoms such as early satiety, postprandial fullness, nausea, vomiting, bloating, and abdominal pain.\n\nA total of 24 healthy Japanese male participants (age 20–60 years, BMI 18.5–25 kg/m², body weight ≥50 kg) were enrolled and allocated to 3 parallel cohorts (n = 8 per cohort). In each cohort, 6 participants received active trazpiroben and 2 received placebo. Cohort 1 received 50 mg, cohort 2 received up to 100 mg (dose selected based on blinded review of preceding safety and PK data), and cohort 3 received 10 mg. All participants received a single oral dose of blinded study drug on day 1 (single‑dose phase), followed by twice‑daily dosing from day 3 through day 7 (multiple‑dose phase), with no evening dose on day 7. Morning doses were administered after at least a 10‑hour fast, and evening doses were given 12 hours after the morning dose and at least 2 hours after the evening meal.\n\nInclusion criteria required healthy Japanese men with no clinically significant medical history, particularly no seizure or tardive dyskinesia, hyperprolactinemia, pituitary adenoma, hypothyroidism, or gastrointestinal diseases that could affect drug absorption. Participants with prolonged QTc, abnormal liver or kidney function, or abnormal ECGs at screening or baseline were excluded.\n\nSafety assessments included continuous monitoring of treatment‑emergent adverse events (TEAEs), physical examinations, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and 12‑lead ECGs at multiple time points after dosing on specified study days. No serious or severe AEs occurred, and no participants discontinued due to AEs. Only five mild TEAEs were reported (pharyngitis, increased creatinine, increased lactate dehydrogenase, and others), none in more than one participant and none considered related to trazpiroben. There were no QTc prolongation–associated, neurological, or hyperprolactinemia‑associated TEAEs, and no clinically meaningful differences in laboratory tests, vital signs, or ECGs between trazpiroben and placebo groups.\n\nFor PK analysis, plasma samples for trazpiroben and its pharmacologically inactive metabolite M23 were collected before and at multiple time points up to 24 hours after dosing on days 1, 2, 7, and 8, and pre‑dose on days 3–6. Urine samples were collected over defined intervals on days 1, 2, and 7. Trazpiroben and M23 concentrations in plasma and urine were quantified using validated LC‑MS/MS methods. PK parameters included Cmax, AUC (various intervals), tmax, elimination half‑life (t1/2z), fraction excreted in urine, and renal clearance.\n\nTrazpiroben showed rapid absorption (median tmax ~1 hour, and tmax at steady state ~1.0–1.3 hours) and relatively rapid elimination (mean t1/2z ~1.9–5.2 hours after a single dose and 3.7–6.5 hours after multiple doses). Cmax ranged from 7.2 to 64.7 ng/mL after single doses, and Cmax at steady state from 8.0 to 81.8 ng/mL. Cmax and AUC increased in a dose‑proportional or approximately dose‑proportional manner over the 10–100 mg range for both trazpiroben and M23. Minimal accumulation was observed after twice‑daily dosing for 5 days, with accumulation ratios based on AUC and Cmax generally around 1.1–1.8. Urinary excretion parameters were similar between day 1 and day 7 and across doses.\n\nPharmacodynamically, serum prolactin concentrations were used as a biomarker of dopamine D2 receptor antagonism. Blood for prolactin was collected at similar time points to PK sampling. After trazpiroben administration, prolactin levels increased rapidly compared with placebo, with a median tmax of about 1 hour for single doses and 1–2 hours at steady state. Prolactin t1/2z ranged from about 13.9–29.1 hours after single dosing and 71.3–84.7 hours after multiple dosing. Mean prolactin Cmax values during the single‑dose phase ranged from about 79.0 to 93.6 ng/mL with trazpiroben versus 10.8 ng/mL with placebo, and steady‑state Cmax ranged from about 41.9 to 78.8 ng/mL with trazpiroben versus 11.9 ng/mL with placebo. Increases in prolactin exposure with higher trazpiroben doses were less than dose‑proportional, suggesting that a near‑maximal pharmacodynamic effect is achieved at the lowest 10‑mg dose. Little accumulation of prolactin was observed with repeated dosing.\n\nFindings from this Japanese study were compared informally with those from a prior phase I study in predominantly White and Black/African American healthy participants in the United States (AT‑01C, NCT03268941). PK parameters, including Cmax and AUC, were generally similar between Japanese and US populations, with overlapping distributions of individual exposures, although median values were slightly higher in Japanese participants. Serum prolactin responses also overlapped between studies, with near‑maximal increases already at the 10‑mg dose and minimal accumulation upon multiple dosing in both ethnic groups. These results indicate no clinically relevant ethnic difference in trazpiroben disposition or pharmacodynamic profile between Japanese and US participants.\n\nOverall, trazpiroben administered as single and multiple oral doses of 10, 50, and 100 mg was well tolerated in healthy Japanese men and demonstrated predictable, approximately dose‑proportional PK and robust PD target engagement via prolactin release, consistent with D2/D3 receptor antagonism. The safety and PK/PD profiles were highly similar to those observed in the US phase I study, supporting the potential for trazpiroben to be used across different ethnic populations for the chronic treatment of gastroparesis. Further evaluation is ongoing in phase II studies in patients with idiopathic or diabetic gastroparesis (e.g., NCT03544229).""}","{""conditions"": [""Gastroparesis"", ""Diabetic Gastroparesis"", ""Gastric Emptying Disorders""], ""keywords"": [""Gastroparesis"", ""Diabetic Gastroparesis"", ""Gastric Motility Disorders"", ""Delayed Gastric Emptying"", ""Dopamine D2 Receptor Antagonists"", ""Dopamine D3 Receptor Antagonists"", ""Prokinetic Agents"", ""Trazpiroben"", ""TAK-906"", ""ATC-1906M"", ""Chronic Gastric Dysmotility""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE1""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Phase I, single- and multiple-ascending dose, parallel-group study with 3 dose cohorts; within each cohort participants were randomized to active trazpiroben or placebo."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""BASIC_SCIENCE"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Double-blind, placebo-controlled: participants and study staff were blinded to assignment to trazpiroben or placebo in each cohort."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT"", ""CARE_PROVIDER"", ""INVESTIGATOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 24, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Trazpiroben 10 mg"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Healthy Japanese male participants received trazpiroben 10 mg orally as a single dose on day 1, followed by multiple doses of 10 mg twice daily from day 3 through day 7 (morning and evening), with no evening dose on day 7.

About 5000 women in their third trimester are randomised 1:1 to receive tailored SMS messages during pregnancy and up to 6 weeks after delivery, or to receive no SMS (standard care). The messages provide information, motivation and behavioural skills to support essential newborn care, early recognition of neonatal danger signs, appropriate care-seeking, and maternal psychosocial well-being. The main hypothesis is that the SMS intervention will reduce neonatal mortality by improving essential newborn care practices, timely care-seeking, maternal social support, self-efficacy and reducing perinatal depression."", ""detailedDescription"": ""Mobile WACh NEO is a multisite, parallel-group, superiority randomised controlled trial conducted at six health facilities in Kenya (urban Nairobi and rural Western Kenya). The trial targets pregnant women aged 14 years and older who are 28–36 weeks’ gestation, enrolled in antenatal care at a study site, have daily access to a Safaricom mobile phone, are willing to receive SMS, plan to remain in the area for at least 5 months, and are not enrolled in another study. Literacy is not required if a trusted person can read and send messages on the participant’s behalf.\n\nParticipants (n=5000) are randomised 1:1 to an interactive two-way SMS intervention (Mobile WACh NEO) or a control group with no study SMS. Randomisation is stratified by site, uses variable block sizes, and is implemented via a web-based system; participants and site staff are unblinded, but investigators are blinded to aggregate results until study completion.\n\nThe intervention consists of semi-automated, tailored SMS messages informed by the Information-Motivation-Behaviour Skills (IMB) model. Messages are sent in English, Kiswahili or Dholuo according to participant preference and are tailored to gestational age or postpartum age, with different frequencies across periods: weekly from enrolment until 38 weeks’ gestation, daily from 38 weeks to delivery, twice daily from delivery to 2 weeks postpartum, and every other day from 2 to 6 weeks postpartum. Content focuses on essential newborn care (ENC)—including early and exclusive breastfeeding, thermal care, delayed bathing, clean cord care, and kangaroo mother care for preterm/low birth weight infants—identification of neonatal danger signs, birth planning and facility delivery, and maternal mental health, social support and self-efficacy. Messages are interactive and typically contain questions prompting engagement.\n\nParticipants in the intervention arm can send SMS at any time; trained study nurses respond during business hours using a human–computer hybrid platform that supports two-way communication, templated responses for common issues, and triage. Nurses prioritise messages indicating maternal or neonatal danger signs, serious adverse events, or home delivery, and refer participants to facility care when appropriate. Participants reporting intimate partner violence, suicidal ideation, severe depressive symptoms or severe food insecurity are referred to local resources. High-risk messaging tracks provide additional tailored content for first-time or very young mothers (≤19 years), women screening positive for elevated depressive symptoms, and mothers of preterm or low birth weight infants. If a pregnancy or infant loss occurs, automated messages stop and women are offered an alternative track with supportive condolence messages and no pregnancy or infant-care content.\n\nThe primary outcome is neonatal mortality, defined as death within the first 28 days after a live birth, ascertained from clinic records and maternal report, with verbal autopsy conducted for infant deaths. Secondary outcomes include: early neonatal mortality (death within 7 days); early initiation of breastfeeding (within 1 hour of birth); delayed bathing (≥24 hours after birth); avoidance of substances on the umbilical cord; time to cessation of breastfeeding; provision of kangaroo mother care for preterm or low birth weight infants; maternal knowledge of neonatal danger signs; maternal depressive symptoms measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; social support measured by the MOS Social Support Scale; and parenting self-efficacy measured by the Karitane Parenting Confidence Scale. Exploratory analyses will evaluate relationships between maternal mental health, ENC practices, care-seeking, and intervention engagement.\n\nData are collected at enrolment (third trimester) and at 2 and 6 weeks postpartum via tablet-based questionnaires, supplemented by abstraction of clinical records (including maternity registers, maternal and child health booklets, and hospital discharge forms). Follow-up visits are conducted in conjunction with routine clinical visits when possible or via phone; home tracing is employed when needed, though in-person home visits were suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic according to national guidance.\n\nThe planned sample size of 5000 participants provides 80% power (alpha=0.05, assuming 10% attrition) to detect a risk ratio of ≤0.53 in neonatal mortality, based on an assumed control-arm neonatal mortality rate of 23 per 1000 live births. Power calculations for secondary outcomes are based on Bonferroni adjustment; analyses of secondary endpoints will ultimately use Benjamini–Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons. The primary analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle and use log-binomial regression for risk outcomes, Cox proportional hazards for breastfeeding duration, Poisson models for counts, and linear models for continuous psychosocial scores, with generalised estimating equations where appropriate. Sensitivity analyses will explore the impact of loss to follow-up on neonatal mortality, and an exploratory per-protocol analysis will exclude women who discontinue the SMS intervention. An interim analysis for neonatal mortality is planned using O’Brien–Fleming stopping boundaries when approximately 50% of person-time has accrued.\n\nSafety is monitored via systematic collection of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), including pregnancy loss, maternal or infant hospitalisation or death. SAEs are reported promptly to relevant ethics committees. A Data Safety Monitoring Board composed of independent experts in biostatistics, maternal–child health, paediatrics and mHealth oversees trial safety.\n\nThe trial is approved by institutional review boards at the University of Washington, Women and Infants Hospital, and Kenyatta National Hospital/University of Nairobi, and is registered under NCT04598165. The investigators plan to disseminate findings through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and policy briefs for Kenyan health authorities, with the goal of informing scalable strategies to reduce neonatal mortality and improve maternal and newborn health in resource-limited settings.""}","{""conditions"": [""Neonatal Mortality"", ""Newborn Health"", ""Infant, Newborn, Diseases"", ""Perinatal Depression"", ""Postpartum Depression"", ""Maternal Health"", ""Pregnancy"", ""Low Birth Weight Infant"", ""Preterm Birth"", ""Kangaroo-Mother Care"", ""Breast Feeding"", ""Thermoregulation"", ""Umbilical Cord Infections""], ""keywords"": [""Neonatal mortality"", ""Newborn care"", ""Essential newborn care"", ""Care seeking behavior"", ""Neonatal danger signs"", ""Breastfeeding"", ""Exclusive breastfeeding"", ""Early initiation of breastfeeding"", ""Thermal care"", ""Delayed bathing"", ""Cord care"", ""Kangaroo Mother Care"", ""Low birth weight"", ""Preterm infant"", ""Maternal mental health"", ""Perinatal depression"", ""Postpartum depression"", ""Social support"", ""Parenting self-efficacy"", ""mHealth"", ""Short Message Service"", ""SMS intervention"", ""Mobile health"", ""Health communication"", ""Health behavior"", ""Information-Motivation-Behavioural Skills model"", ""Randomized controlled trial"", ""Kenya"", ""Maternal and child health""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Multisite, two-arm, 1:1 individually randomized, parallel-group, superiority randomized controlled trial comparing peripartum interactive two-way SMS to standard of care (no SMS) control."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""PREVENTION"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Unblinded randomized controlled trial; participants and study staff know the assigned study arm, while the principal investigator and co-investigators are blinded to study findings until study close."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 5000, ""type"": ""ESTIMATED""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Interactive two-way SMS (Mobile WACh NEO)"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Participants randomized to this arm receive the Mobile Solutions for Neonatal Health (Mobile WACh NEO) intervention: a semiautomated, two-way short messaging service (SMS) communication program starting in the third trimester (28–36 weeks gestation) and continuing until 6 weeks postpartum.

The program is designed to reduce minority stress (such as discrimination, family rejection, and internalized homonegativity) and to improve mental health outcomes including depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and suicidality. Four high schools in a Southern California district were randomized to either receive the P&E intervention during the school day or to continue with classes as usual (control). SGMA students completed questionnaires on minority stress and mental health symptoms before and after the 10‑week program. The study hypothesized that youth in the intervention schools would report lower minority stress and better mental health, and that participation in P&E would weaken the link between minority stress and negative mental health outcomes."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This study evaluated the preliminary efficacy of Proud & Empowered (P&E), a theory‑driven, school‑based preventive intervention for sexual and gender minority adolescents (SGMA), defined as youth who identify as non‑heterosexual and/or whose gender identity does not align with sex assigned at birth. SGMA experience elevated rates of internalizing psychopathology (depression, anxiety, self‑harm, posttraumatic stress disorder) and externalizing outcomes (substance use, suicidal behavior) relative to heterosexual, cisgender peers. Minority stress theory posits that discrimination, violence, and victimization contribute to chronic minority stress, which in turn drives these behavioral health disparities.\n\nP&E was developed using the NIH Intervention Stage Model and informed by extensive qualitative and quantitative work, including creation of the Sexual Minority Adolescent Stress Inventory (SMASI), a validated 54‑item measure capturing 10 minority stress domains (social marginalization, family rejection, internalized homonegativity, identity management, homonegative climate, intersectionality, negative disclosure experiences, religion, negative expectancies, and homonegative communication). Each of P&E’s 10 sessions maps onto these domains and includes content on stress and coping, disclosure decision‑making, family, school climate, peers and friendship, relationship safety, spirituality and religion, race/ethnicity and social justice, LGBTQ community and history, and intersections of health, substance use, HIV, and the medical system. Sessions use psychoeducation, guided discussion, and interactive activities, and are delivered in ~45‑minute weekly class‑period groups.\n\nThe randomized controlled trial was conducted in fall 2019 in four diverse public high schools in a unified Southern California district, all of which had gender and sexuality alliances but no other SGMA‑specific programming. Schools (not individual students) were randomized to intervention or control. In intervention schools, SGMA students attended P&E once weekly during an advisory/homeroom period, led by a project coordinator and a trained school staff co‑facilitator; in control schools, SGMA students attended regular classes and received no additional SGMA‑specific program. All participants completed pretest assessments one week before the first session and posttest assessments one week after the final session, with gift‑card incentives.\n\nEligibility criteria included being enrolled at one of the four high schools, English‑speaking, self‑identifying as LGBT or other non‑heterosexual or non‑cisgender identity, and able to provide assent/consent. Due to confidentiality concerns and risk of forced disclosure of sexual or gender identity, parental consent was waived by the institutional review board. The study ultimately retained 44 participants (26 intervention, 18 control; 95.6% retention), with no significant baseline differences between conditions in demographic variables or in minority stress and mental health measures.\n\nOutcome measures included: (1) minority stress (SMASI total and 10 subscales); (2) anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory); (3) depression (Beck Depression Inventory‑II); (4) PTSD symptoms (PTSD Checklist for DSM‑5, plus a 6‑item PTSD index); and (5) suicidality (adapted Columbia‑Suicide Severity Rating Scale, scored by worst‑point severity in the past 30 days). Demographic characteristics (gender identity, sex assigned at birth, age, grade, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, religion, language, work status, and living situation) were collected at both time points. Fidelity monitoring documented adherence to curriculum, dosage, quality of delivery, participant responsiveness, and cultural appropriateness.\n\nAnalytically, the study used chi‑square tests and one‑way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) to verify baseline equivalence between groups, then two‑by‑two (group × time) repeated‑measures ANOVAs to test condition differences over time on minority stress (SMASI total and subscales) and mental health outcomes. Moderation analyses were conducted using multiple regression (PROCESS in SPSS) to test whether intervention condition moderated the associations between minority stress and each mental health outcome at posttest, controlling for baseline symptom levels.\n\nResults showed a significant group × time interaction for the SMASI internalized homonegativity subscale: intervention participants showed a decrease in internalized homonegativity from pre‑ to posttest, while control participants showed an increase. There were no significant group × time interactions for SMASI total or other subscales, or for the main mental health outcomes, in this small sample. However, descriptive patterns indicated that intervention youth reported reduced anxiety and stable depression symptoms, whereas control youth showed no change in anxiety and increased depression.\n\nModeration analyses revealed significant intervention × minority stress interactions for PTSD, depression, and suicidality. Among control participants, higher minority stress at posttest tended to be associated with higher PTSD, depression, and suicidality scores. Among intervention participants, these associations were attenuated or reversed, such that higher minority stress was not associated with increased symptoms and in some cases trended toward lower symptom levels. These findings suggest that P&E may mitigate the impact of minority stress on PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation/behavior, potentially by enhancing coping skills and social support, even when distal stressors (e.g., school climate, family rejection) remain present.\n\nThe trial had several limitations, notably the small sample size from a single, urban school district, which limited statistical power, precluded subgroup analyses (e.g., by race/ethnicity or gender identity), and restricted generalizability. Additionally, planned longer‑term follow‑up was not possible due to COVID‑19–related school closures. Despite these limitations, the study provides preliminary evidence that Proud & Empowered reduces specific aspects of minority stress (particularly internalized homonegativity) and buffers the relationship between minority stress and key mental health outcomes in SGMA. The intervention is positioned as an individually chosen, school‑based program that does not rely on family involvement, addressing a critical gap in psychoeducational and preventive services for sexual and gender minority adolescents.\n\nThe trial was approved by the USC Social Behavioral IRB and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04041414).

A total of 307 children with CPP, predominantly girls, received subcutaneous leuprorelin 1.88 or 3.75 mg every 4 weeks for 96 weeks. The main goal was to assess how often treatment-emergent adverse events occurred and whether pubertal development, measured by Tanner stage, stopped progressing or regressed. The study also examined hormone suppression, changes in bone age relative to chronological age, predicted adult height, body mass index, and bone mineral density. The results showed that leuprorelin was generally well tolerated, with mostly mild or moderate adverse events, and effectively suppressed the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, slowed pubertal progression, improved predicted adult height, and reduced the bone age/chronological age ratio in most patients."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This was a large, prospective, open-label, multicenter clinical trial conducted at 11 pediatric centers in China to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of leuprorelin in children with central precocious puberty (CPP). CPP was defined as the premature onset of secondary sexual characteristics due to early activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Eligible patients were girls younger than 8 years and boys younger than 9 years with confirmed CPP based on clinical signs, hormonal criteria (elevated basal or GnRH-stimulated luteinizing hormone [LH] with LH/follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] ratio >0.6), ultrasonographic evidence of gonadal development, advanced bone age (BA) by at least 1 year, and compromised predicted adult height.\n\nThe study included a 4-week screening period, 96 weeks of leuprorelin treatment, and a 4-week safety follow-up. Children with body mass ≥20 kg received 3.75 mg leuprorelin subcutaneously every 4 weeks; those <20 kg received 1.88 mg every 4 weeks. Doses could be adjusted based on clinical response and investigator judgment. Treatment evaluations occurred approximately every 12 weeks and included Tanner stage assessment, anthropometric measurements (height, body mass, body mass index), bone mineral density (BMD), BA assessment, and pelvic ultrasonography. Hormonal assessments included GnRH-stimulated peak LH and FSH, and basal estradiol (E2) in girls and testosterone in boys.\n\nThe primary endpoint was the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). The main secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients with regression or no progression in Tanner stage at week 96 compared with baseline. Additional endpoints included: suppression of peak LH and FSH to prepubertal levels in stimulation testing; suppression of basal sex steroid concentrations (E2 in females, testosterone in males) to prepubertal levels; improvement in predicted adult height using the Bayley–Pinneau method; reduction in the BA/chronological age (CA) ratio using Tanner–Whitehouse 3 standards; and changes in BMI and BMD over the treatment period.\n\nA total of 340 children were screened and 307 were enrolled and treated (305 girls and 2 boys). Most patients received leuprorelin for more than 672 days (approximately 96 weeks), and 98% had greater than 90% treatment compliance. The majority (over 96%) started at a dose ≥90 μg/kg, and most remained on higher doses throughout treatment.\n\nSafety findings showed that 252 patients (82.1%) experienced at least one TEAE, but 71.3% of patients had TEAEs judged unrelated to the study drug. Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. Common TEAEs (≥5%) were mainly infections and respiratory-related events (upper respiratory tract infection, cough, pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis). Drug-related TEAEs occurred in 10.7% of patients; the most frequent were injection site induration (4.6%) and vaginal bleeding (2.3%). Injection site reactions were self-limited. Vaginal bleeding typically occurred once within the first 1–2 months of treatment, consistent with estrogen withdrawal due to gonadotropin suppression. Twenty-one serious AEs occurred in 12 patients, none deemed related to leuprorelin; one patient withdrew due to a tibial fibula fracture. No deaths were reported. No relevant trends were observed in laboratory tests, vital signs, or electrocardiograms.\n\nEfficacy analyses focused on the 305 female patients because only 2 males were enrolled. At week 96, 83.5% of evaluable girls (238/285) had regression or no progression of Tanner stage compared with baseline, while 16.5% showed progression. Suppression of GnRH-stimulated peak LH to prepubertal levels (≤2 U/L) occurred in 90.4% (253/280) of patients, and suppression of peak FSH (≤6.7 U/L) in 95.4% (270/283). Basal E2 was reduced to prepubertal levels (≤20 pg/mL) in 59.4% (168/283) of girls.\n\nWith respect to growth and maturation, 64.6% of girls (181/280) had an improved predicted adult height at week 96 compared with baseline, with a mean increase of 2.19 cm. The BA/CA ratio decreased in 94% of patients (252/268), with a mean change of −0.11, indicating slowing of skeletal maturation. BMI increased by a mean of 1.66 kg/m² over 96 weeks, consistent with some reports of transient BMI increases during GnRH analog therapy. BMD changed minimally over the treatment period (mean change ~0.041 g/cm² around week 100), suggesting that bone mineral accrual was not adversely impacted in a clinically meaningful way during the treatment period.\n\nThe study confirmed that monthly subcutaneous leuprorelin at 1.88–3.75 mg (approximately 30–180 μg/kg) is effective in suppressing the HPG axis and halting or reversing pubertal progression in most Chinese children with CPP, while improving growth prognosis as reflected by predicted adult height and a reduced BA/CA ratio. The safety profile, including the nature and frequency of drug-related adverse events such as injection site reactions and transient vaginal bleeding, was consistent with the known profile of GnRH analog therapy. The trial provides long-term safety and efficacy data supporting the use of leuprorelin at the higher dose range approved in China for CPP treatment, although the small number of male participants and the concentration of centers in more developed regions were noted limitations.""}","{""conditions"": [""Central Precocious Puberty"", ""Precocious Puberty""], ""keywords"": [""Central Precocious Puberty"", ""Precocious Puberty"", ""Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone"", ""Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Agonists"", ""Leuprorelin"", ""Leuprolide"", ""Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal Axis"", ""Luteinizing Hormone"", ""Follicle-Stimulating Hormone"", ""Estradiol"", ""Testosterone"", ""Bone Age"", ""Bone Mineral Density"", ""Body Mass Index"", ""Tanner Stage"", ""Puberty""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""PHASE3""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""NON_RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""SINGLE_GROUP"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Prospective, open-label, multicenter, single-arm trial in which all enrolled children with central precocious puberty received leuprorelin subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 96 weeks."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": ""PROSPECTIVE"", ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Open-label study with no blinding of participants, care providers, or investigators."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 307, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Leuprorelin 1.88–3.75 mg every 4 weeks"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Single-arm, open-label treatment of children with central precocious puberty with subcutaneous leuprorelin for 96 weeks.

The primary outcome is change in mean systolic blood pressure from baseline to 6 months.

The trial is conducted within the Brigham and Women’s Primary Care Practice-Based Research Network, which includes 15 diverse practices. The design is a pragmatic, cluster-randomised controlled trial, with randomisation at the clinician level (including solo primary care clinicians and co-management dyads) to minimise contamination and align with the clinician-focused nature of the intervention.\n\nEligible patients are adults (≥18 years) with CKD, defined by two prior estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values of 16–59 mL/min/1.73 m² or two urine albumin-to-creatinine ratios (UACR) >30 mg/g at least 90 days apart, who also have uncontrolled hypertension, defined as at least one systolic blood pressure (SBP) >140 mm Hg in the prior 2 years and SBP >140 mm Hg at the enrolment visit. Patients with very advanced kidney dysfunction (eGFR ≤20 most recent or two eGFRs ≤15 mL/min/1.73 m² separated by at least 90 days) are excluded. Patients are automatically enrolled at the time of qualifying primary care visits, with group assignment based on their clinician’s randomisation status.\n\nThe core of the intervention is a set of Epic Best Practice Advisories (BPAs) built on five computable phenotypes that identify CKD patients with uncontrolled SBP who would benefit from: (1) initiation of an ACE inhibitor (ACEi), (2) initiation of an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), (3) up-titration of a suboptimal ACEi dose, (4) up-titration of a suboptimal ARB dose, and (5) addition of a diuretic when ACEi or ARB therapy is maximised. When a qualifying patient’s chart is opened by an intervention clinician, the BPA displays patient-specific information explaining why it fired, structured treatment recommendations (for example, a suggested ACEi starting dose or ARB dose increase), and hyperlinks to relevant CKD and hypertension clinical guidelines.\n\nUser-centred design methods were used to develop and refine the CDS interface, including contextual inquiry of clinical workflows, group design sessions, and individual “think aloud” usability testing. These methods informed how data are displayed, how recommendations are framed, and how clinicians interact with the advisory. Behavioural economic principles are incorporated through default options, accountability, and public commitment: clinicians receive a pre-commitment email inviting them to pledge adherence to blood pressure treatment recommendations, and the BPA requires an ‘accountable justification’ if a clinician declines a recommendation, encouraging explicit documentation of the rationale. The CDS fires at the initial enrolment visit; follow-up firing occurs only if the clinician requests a reminder and if the patient still meets criteria (for example, persistent SBP >140/90 mm Hg and no newly documented contraindications or target medication use).\n\nImplementation was preceded by a silent-mode period and a short live pilot during which the CDS ran without being visible (for validation) and then was briefly activated to evaluate clinician interactions and uncover workflow issues and potential workarounds. Observed workarounds included selecting ‘other’ as a justification with non-informative text or initiating but not signing medication orders to dismiss the alert. These observations inform the assessment of real-world adoption and alert fatigue but did not lead to substantive modifications of the CDS logic for the main trial.\n\nOutcomes are evaluated within the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. The primary clinical endpoint is the change in mean SBP from baseline (prior year mean SBP) to 6 months, comparing intervention and control arms using generalised estimating equations that account for patient clustering within clinicians. Secondary outcomes include hypertension management process measures (for example, initiation or intensification of ACEi/ARB or diuretics, ordering of basic metabolic panels), CKD quality-of-care processes (for example, annual urine albumin testing), adverse drug events, and hypotension. Additional RE-AIM outcomes include reach (number and types of clinicians and patients exposed to the CDS), adoption (patterns of BPA acceptance, rejection, and justification), implementation (fidelity, barriers, workarounds, unintended consequences), and maintenance (sustainability of CDS use and integration into workflow over time).\n\nSample size calculations assumed an expected clinically meaningful 3 mm Hg greater reduction in SBP in the intervention arm compared with usual care, an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.1, and an average of six patients per clinician, yielding a requirement of approximately 497 evaluable patients per arm to achieve >80% power. Analyses will be primarily intent-to-intervene, with secondary analyses including multiple imputation for patients without follow-up visits, as-treated analyses based on actual clinician ordering behaviour, and clinician-level analyses. The trial received expedited ethical approval; patient-level informed consent was waived due to the pragmatic, clinician-level randomisation, and a Data Safety Monitoring Board oversees safety and potential harms such as hypotension and medication-related adverse events.""}","{""conditions"": [""Chronic Kidney Disease"", ""Hypertension"", ""Uncontrolled Hypertension"", ""Renal Insufficiency"", ""Kidney Failure, Chronic""], ""keywords"": [""Chronic Kidney Disease"", ""Hypertension"", ""Uncontrolled Hypertension"", ""Clinical Decision Support Systems"", ""Electronic Health Records"", ""Primary Health Care"", ""ACE Inhibitors"", ""Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists"", ""Diuretics"", ""Blood Pressure"", ""Systolic Blood Pressure"", ""Implementation Science"", ""RE-AIM Framework"", ""Behavioural Economics"", ""User-Centered Design"", ""Computable Phenotype"", ""Best Practice Advisory"", ""Epic Systems""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Pragmatic, multicentre, cluster-randomised controlled trial at the clinician level, with intervention vs usual care arms in parallel; outcomes measured at the patient level."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""No blinding; clinicians know their allocation (live vs silent clinical decision support), and outcomes are assessed using electronic health record data."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 994, ""type"": ""ESTIMATED""}, ""targetDuration"": null}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Intervention Arm"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Primary care clinicians randomized to the intervention receive a multicomponent, clinician-level clinical decision support (CDS) package within the Epic electronic health record for patients with chronic kidney disease and uncontrolled hypertension.

The trial was conducted at 64 sites in the United States, Spain, Denmark, and the United Kingdom between September 18, 2020, and April 8, 2021. Trial sites included outpatient infusion centers, skilled nursing facilities, and home‑infusion settings.\n\nEligible patients were 12 years of age or older with laboratory‑confirmed SARS‑CoV‑2 infection by molecular assay within 4 days prior to screening and with onset of at least one COVID‑19 symptom within the previous 7 days. Participants also had to have at least one predefined risk factor for severe COVID‑19 (e.g., age ≥60 years, obesity with BMI ≥30, hypertension, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, chronic mild or moderate kidney disease, immunocompromised state, current cancer, or sickle cell disease) or be ≥60 years of age regardless of other conditions.\n\nKey exclusion criteria included current or anticipated need for supplemental oxygen or hospital care at screening, prior hospitalization for COVID‑19, prior receipt of COVID‑19–directed therapy (including investigational agents), and prior receipt of a SARS‑CoV‑2 vaccine.\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either remdesivir or placebo, stratified by residence in a skilled nursing facility (yes/no), age (<60 vs. ≥60 years), and country (United States vs. outside the United States). Remdesivir was administered intravenously as 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2 and 3; the control group received matching placebo infusions. Patients, investigators, and trial staff were blinded to treatment assignment.\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of hospitalization related to COVID‑19 (defined as ≥24 hours of acute care) or death from any cause through day 28. The primary safety endpoint was the occurrence of any adverse event. Key secondary endpoints included a composite of COVID‑19–related medically attended visits (e.g., emergency department, urgent care, or other unscheduled visits for COVID‑19) or death from any cause by days 14 and 28, COVID‑19–related hospitalization by days 14 and 28, time‑weighted average change from baseline in nasopharyngeal SARS‑CoV‑2 viral load through day 7, and time to alleviation of baseline COVID‑19 symptoms as measured by the FLU‑PRO Plus patient‑reported outcome instrument. Post hoc analyses included hospitalization for any cause by day 28 and alternative definitions of time to symptom alleviation.\n\nPhysical examinations, laboratory testing (including renal and hepatic function), adverse event monitoring, and nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS‑CoV‑2 viral load by RT‑PCR were performed at prespecified intervals. Patients completed the electronic FLU‑PRO Plus questionnaire daily through day 14 to capture patient‑reported respiratory and systemic symptoms.\n\nThe trial originally planned to enroll 1264 patients, providing >90% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.55 for COVID‑19–related hospitalization or death, assuming a 9.3% event rate and 5% dropout. Enrollment was stopped early for administrative and ethical reasons (declining incidence, increased availability of emergency‑use–authorized therapies, and rising vaccination among high‑risk populations), resulting in 562 patients who underwent randomization and received at least one infusion (279 remdesivir; 283 placebo). No interim efficacy analyses were performed before study discontinuation, and blinding was maintained until database lock.\n\nBaseline characteristics were well balanced between groups. The mean age was 50 years; 30.2% of patients were ≥60 years; 47.9% were women; 41.8% were Hispanic or Latinx. The most prevalent comorbidities were diabetes mellitus (61.6%), obesity (55.2%), and hypertension (47.7%). The median time from symptom onset to first infusion was 5 days, and from positive SARS‑CoV‑2 test to screening was 2 days.\n\nBy day 28, COVID‑19–related hospitalization or death from any cause occurred in 2 of 279 patients (0.7%) in the remdesivir group and 15 of 283 (5.3%) in the placebo group, yielding a hazard ratio of 0.13 (95% CI, 0.03–0.59; P=0.008), corresponding to an 87% relative risk reduction. All COVID‑19–related hospitalizations occurred by day 14, and no deaths occurred in either group by day 28. In prespecified subgroup analyses (e.g., by diabetes, obesity, sex, hypertension, and ethnicity), remdesivir consistently reduced the risk of the primary endpoint relative to placebo.\n\nFor the secondary composite endpoint of COVID‑19–related medically attended visits or death by day 28, 4 of 246 patients (1.6%) in the remdesivir group and 21 of 252 (8.3%) in the placebo group had an event (hazard ratio, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.07–0.56). By day 14, the corresponding proportions were 0.8% vs. 7.9%. A post hoc analysis of hospitalization for any cause by day 28 found events in 5 of 279 patients (1.8%) in the remdesivir group and 18 of 283 (6.4%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.10–0.75).\n\nNasopharyngeal viral load declined over time in both groups, but there was no substantial between‑group difference in time‑weighted average change from baseline to day 7 (−1.24 log10 copies/mL with remdesivir vs. −1.14 log10 copies/mL with placebo; least‑squares mean difference, 0.07; 95% CI, −0.10 to 0.24). This suggests that clinical benefit may not correlate directly with reductions in upper respiratory tract viral RNA levels.\n\nRemdesivir demonstrated an acceptable safety profile in the outpatient setting. By day 28, any adverse event occurred in 42.3% of remdesivir recipients and 46.3% of placebo recipients. The most frequent nonserious adverse events (≥5% in both groups) were nausea, headache, and cough. Adverse events judged related to study drug were reported in 12.2% of patients in the remdesivir group and 8.8% in the placebo group. Serious adverse events were less frequent with remdesivir (1.8%) than with placebo (6.7%).

These findings extend the known benefits of remdesivir from hospitalized patients with moderate‑to‑severe disease to earlier, outpatient treatment of high‑risk individuals and support its role as an

Participants were randomized to cabergoline 0.5 mg twice weekly plus daily placebo or NETA 5 mg daily plus twice‑weekly placebo. The main goal was to see whether cabergoline, a dopamine D2 receptor agonist that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling and angiogenesis, could reduce pelvic pain and improve function at least as well as NETA, while maintaining an acceptable safety profile. Pain intensity, pain-related interference with daily activities, emotional functioning, global impression of change, and biomarkers of angiogenesis and inflammation were measured over 6 months. In this small sample, cabergoline was well tolerated and associated with decreases in pain scores and reductions in VEGF receptor 1, suggesting it may be a promising nonhormonal option for endometriosis-related pain."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6‑month pilot trial conducted at Boston Children’s Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital between 2016 and 2018. The trial enrolled premenopausal women aged 15–40 years with laparoscopically and surgically confirmed American Society for Reproductive Medicine stage I–II endometriosis within the prior 2 years and clinically significant pelvic pain, defined as a visual analog scale (VAS) pain score of at least 3 out of 10 in the last month. Women using other hormonal medications, with thrombotic disease, or with contraindications to the study drugs (e.g., impaired liver function, breast cancer, cardiac valvular disorders) were excluded.\n\nThe rationale for the trial is based on the key role of angiogenesis and associated neurogenesis in the establishment and maintenance of endometriosis lesions and chronic pain. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inflammatory cytokines contribute to ectopic implantation of endometrial tissue, lesion growth, and symptom generation. Dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) agonists such as cabergoline have been shown in animal models to inhibit pathological angiogenesis by inactivating VEGF receptor 2 (VEGF‑R2) signaling without the teratogenicity and systemic toxicity associated with many commercial antiangiogenic agents. Prior preclinical work and a small human study using another DRD2 agonist (quinagolide) suggested these agents can reduce endometriosis lesion size and downregulate VEGF/VEGF‑R pathways, though pain outcomes had not been evaluated.\n\nParticipants were randomized in a double-blind fashion to one of two treatment arms: (1) oral norethindrone acetate (NETA) 5 mg daily plus placebo capsule twice weekly, or (2) oral cabergoline 0.5 mg twice weekly plus daily placebo. Medications were dispensed in identical gelatin capsules by the research pharmacy. The principal investigator, study staff, and participants were blinded to treatment allocation. The planned sample size for this pilot was 5 participants per arm to yield at least 4 completers per group; ultimately 9 women were enrolled and randomized (4 to NETA and 5 to cabergoline). Two participants (one from each arm) discontinued early, leaving 7 who completed the 6‑month protocol.\n\nStudy visits occurred at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months, with additional telehealth assessments at 6 and 18 weeks. The primary endpoint was pain, captured across four core domains recommended for chronic pain trials: physical functioning, pain intensity, emotional functioning, and global impression of improvement. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) interference scale was designated as the primary outcome. Pain intensity was assessed with a numerical VAS (0–10) for current, worst, least, and average pain over specified time frames. Emotional functioning was evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Functional impact was assessed with the Functional Disability Inventory. Overall perceived change was measured via the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale. Analgesic use (non-narcotic tablets per week) was tracked.\n\nTo explore mechanistic effects on angiogenesis and inflammation, serum biomarkers were measured at each in‑person visit, including VEGF, VEGF receptor 1 (VEGF‑R1), placental growth factor, TNF‑α, IL‑8, IL‑1β, monocyte chemotactic protein‑1, intercellular adhesion molecule‑1, vascular cell adhesion molecule‑1, and E‑selectin. A urinary marker of oxidative stress, 8‑oxo‑7,8‑dihydro-2′‑deoxyguanosine (8‑oxodG), was also collected. Safety assessments included orthostatic vital signs, body mass index, liver function tests (AST, ALT, bilirubin), lipid profiles, creatinine, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and hemoglobin A1c. Adverse events were captured using an investigator-developed symptom questionnaire focusing on common hormonal and systemic symptoms (e.g., fatigue, mood changes, breast tenderness, nausea, uterine bleeding), and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.8). Medication adherence was monitored via pill counts and pill logs.\n\nBecause of the small sample size, the study was not powered to detect statistically significant between-group differences. Analyses were descriptive, focusing on medians, interquartile ranges, and observed trends over time.\n\nAt baseline, participants in the cabergoline group reported higher current and worst pain scores and less pain relief from existing treatments than those in the NETA group. Over 6 months, women allocated to cabergoline exhibited marked reductions in worst pain intensity in the last 24 hours (median decrease from 7.0 to 1.0) and in the last month (from 8.0 to 3.0), as well as improvements in current and average pain scores and increased percentage of pain relief. The mean 6‑month decrease in worst pain (last 24 hours) was 86% in the cabergoline group versus 43% in the NETA group; average pain declined by 83% versus 57%, respectively. The NETA group showed some improvement in average pain but minimal changes in several other pain parameters. Analgesic use (number of non‑narcotic tablets per week) increased in the NETA group at 6 months, while remaining lower in the cabergoline group.\n\nFunctional disability and depressive symptoms remained generally low and stable in both groups throughout the study. At 3 months, a moderate or high degree of improvement on the PGIC scale was reported by 33% of NETA and 25% of cabergoline participants; by 6 months this increased to 66% for NETA and 50% for cabergoline.\n\nBiomarker analyses showed divergent trends in VEGF‑R1: levels declined over 6 months in the cabergoline group (from approximately 417.6 pg/mL to 344.1 pg/mL) but rose in the NETA group (from 330.7 pg/mL to 447.6 pg/mL). Both groups had small declines in serum VEGF concentrations. Most inflammatory markers remained relatively unchanged, though IL‑8 decreased by about 50% in the cabergoline arm (from 9.5 to 4.5 pg/mL) and remained stable and low in the NETA arm.\n\nCabergoline was generally well tolerated. No subject developed orthostatic hypotension or tachycardia, and liver enzymes and lipid profiles stayed within normal ranges in both treatment groups. Across 40 reported symptom changes, half were mild, 43% moderate, and 7% severe. The most common symptoms were abdominal cramps or bloating, fatigue, and weight gain. Two CTCAE grade 2 adverse events were identified: significant fatigue affecting daily activities and abdominal bloating/pain limiting daily activities. There were no serious adverse events in either arm. Weight gain over 6 months averaged greater than 1.3 kg in the cabergoline group and greater than 2.5 kg in the NETA group. Changes in uterine bleeding patterns, including heavier flow, irregular bleeding, or spotting, were reported somewhat more often in the cabergoline group.\n\nThe investigators interpret these findings as preliminary evidence that cabergoline, by targeting VEGF-mediated angiogenic pathways, may offer a nonhormonal treatment option for endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain with a tolerable safety profile. Given the pilot nature and extremely small sample size, the results are hypothesis-generating and have been used to design larger, prospective randomized trials of cabergoline, particularly as an adjunct to hormonal therapy for patients with endometriosis who are resistant to or seek alternatives to standard hormonal treatments.""}","{""conditions"": [""Endometriosis"", ""Chronic Pelvic Pain"", ""Dysmenorrhea""], ""keywords"": [""Endometriosis"", ""Chronic pelvic pain"", ""Pelvic pain"", ""Dysmenorrhea"", ""Angiogenesis"", ""Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor"", ""VEGF"", ""VEGF receptor 1"", ""VEGF-R1"", ""Dopamine D2 receptor agonists"", ""Cabergoline"", ""Norethindrone acetate"", ""NETA"", ""Nonhormonal therapy"", ""Progestins"", ""Neuroangiogenesis"", ""Inflammation"", ""Interleukin-8"", ""IL-8"", ""Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"", ""TNF-alpha"", ""Adolescent gynecology"", ""Women’s health""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Two-arm parallel-group trial comparing cabergoline plus placebo vs norethindrone acetate (NETA) plus placebo for 6 months."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which participants and investigators were blinded to treatment assignment; active drugs and placebos were dispensed in identical gelatin capsules."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT"", ""INVESTIGATOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 9, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Norethindrone acetate"", ""type"": ""ACTIVE_COMPARATOR"", ""description"": ""Participants received oral norethindrone acetate (NETA) 5 mg once daily plus matching placebo capsule twice weekly for 6 months."", ""interventionNames"": [""Norethindrone acetate"", ""Twice-weekly placebo capsule""]}, {""label"": ""Cabergoline"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Participants received oral cabergoline 0.5 mg twice weekly plus matching placebo tablet once daily for 6 months."", ""interventionNames"": [""Cabergoline"", ""Daily placebo tablet""]}], ""interventions"": [{""type"": ""DRUG"", ""name"": ""Norethindrone acetate"", ""description"": ""Oral norethindrone acetate (NETA) 5 mg administered once daily for 6 months as standard hormonal therapy for endometriosis-associated pain."", ""armGroupLabels"": [""Norethindrone acetate""]}, {""type"": ""DRUG"", ""name"": ""Cabergoline"", ""description"": ""Oral cabergoline 0.5 mg administered twice weekly for 6 months as a nonhormonal dopamine D2 receptor agonist and VEGF pathway inhibitor for endometriosis-associated pain."", ""armGroupLabels"": [""Cabergoline""]}, {""type"": ""DRUG"", ""name"": ""Twice-weekly placebo capsule"", ""description"": ""Oral placebo capsule administered twice weekly for 6 months to match cabergoline dosing schedule in the norethindrone acetate arm."", ""armGroupLabels"": [""Norethindrone acetate""]}, {""type"": ""DRUG"", ""name"": ""Daily placebo tablet"", ""description"": ""Oral placebo tablet administered once daily for 6 months to match norethindrone acetate dosing schedule in the cabergoline arm."", ""armGroupLabels"": [""Cabergoline""]}]}","{""primaryOutcomes"": [{""measure"": ""Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) interference scale"", ""description"": ""Change in pain-related interference with functioning, measured by the 7-item BPI interference scale covering physical functioning, emotional functioning, sleep, and work.

TPE was started within 24 hours of ICU admission and was followed by a 500 ml ABO‑compatible CVP transfusion. The primary endpoint was 30‑day survival; secondary endpoints were changes in oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2 ratio) and inflammatory markers (C‑reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin) at 7 days. The study found higher 30‑day survival, improved oxygenation, and reduced inflammation in the TPE+CVP group, suggesting that early combined therapy may serve as a rescue treatment in severe and critically ill COVID‑19 patients."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This study was a single-centre, prospective, non-randomized controlled trial conducted in an 8‑bed dedicated COVID‑19 intensive care unit at the ‘Dr Teodor Andrei’ Municipal Hospital, Lugoj, Romania, between August 8, 2020, and January 9, 2021. It included 38 adult Caucasian patients (>18 years) with confirmed SARS‑CoV‑2 infection by RT‑PCR on admission, who presented with acute respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS was defined as acute-onset hypoxemia with a PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio <300 mmHg, >50% bilateral pulmonary opacities on chest imaging within 24–48 hours not fully explained by congestive heart failure, and the need for ICU care. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, suspected or confirmed pulmonary embolism, and terminal disease.\n\nPatients were divided equally, in a non-randomized fashion, into two groups. The treatment group (n=19) received a single session of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) followed immediately by convalescent plasma (CVP) transfusion, in addition to standard COVID‑19 therapy. The control group (n=19) received standard therapy alone, according to hospital protocols. Standard treatment included corticosteroids (dexamethasone 16 mg/day), therapeutic-dose low molecular weight heparin (nadroparin adjusted to bodyweight), antiretrovirals (lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir), hydroxychloroquine, and empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics when infection was suspected, with de-escalation based on culture results.\n\nIn the treatment group, TPE was initiated within the first 24 hours after ICU admission. Vascular access was obtained using a dual‑lumen 14‑French catheter placed in the femoral vein under ultrasound guidance. TPE was performed using an Infomed HF 440 machine with a plasma/blood separation ratio of 20%, and 40 ml/kg of fresh frozen plasma was used as replacement fluid. Systemic anticoagulation during the procedure used unfractionated heparin. After completing TPE, each patient received 500 ml of ABO‑compatible CVP, with neutralizing antibody titres ranging from 1:80 to 1:160, levels considered acceptable at the time if higher-titre units were not available. Patients were monitored closely during and after TPE and CVP for hemodynamic instability and other complications.\n\nThe primary endpoint was survival at 30 days. Secondary endpoints included the evolution of oxygenation (P/F ratio) and inflammatory biomarkers—C‑reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and ferritin—assessed at admission and on day 7. Normal reference ranges were CRP 0–5 mg/l, LDH 135–225 U/l, and ferritin 30–400 µg/l. All patients initially received high-flow nasal oxygen (30 l/min, FiO2 1.0) plus a non‑rebreathing mask, with a median baseline P/F ratio around 60.\n\nBaseline characteristics were similar between the two groups in terms of age, sex distribution, comorbidities (including arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and obesity), severity category (severe vs critical), disease stage (Siddiqi and Mehra stages IIb and III), APACHE II score, time from symptom onset to treatment (median 8 days), and use of antiviral drugs. Body mass index (BMI) was higher in the treatment group but other variables were balanced.\n\nAt 30 days, survival was 47.37% (9/19) in the TPE+CVP group versus 26.32% (5/19) in the control group. Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated a statistically significant difference in survival between groups (log‑rank P=0.002). Cox regression analysis showed that treatment with TPE plus CVP was associated with a significantly reduced hazard of death (hazard ratio 0.39; 95% CI 0.16–0.91; P=0.007).\n\nRegarding secondary endpoints, patients in the treatment group exhibited improved oxygenation and decreased markers of systemic inflammation at day 7 compared with controls. The P/F ratio increased more markedly in the treatment group, with a between‑group difference on the threshold of statistical significance (P=0.052). CRP and LDH levels showed statistically significant reductions in the TPE+CVP group relative to the control group. Ferritin levels were higher at baseline in the treatment group but tended to decrease over 7 days, whereas they remained relatively constant in controls; however, the between‑group difference in ferritin change was not statistically significant (P=0.962). These trends were illustrated in graphical analyses comparing admission and day 7 values.\n\nComplications directly attributable to TPE and CVP were minimal. One patient (5.26%) in the treatment group developed transient hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg) after CVP transfusion, which was successfully managed with crystalloid fluid bolus. ICU‑acquired infections occurred in 14 patients (73.68%) in the treatment group and 10 patients (52.63%) in the control group.\n\nMean ICU length of stay (LOS) was longer in the treatment group (16.84 ± 7.25 days) than in the control group (8.58 ± 6.13 days; P=0.001). The authors attribute this apparent paradox, as well as differences in mechanical ventilation durations, to higher early mortality in the control group—7 control patients (36.84%) died by day 7, thus shortening measured LOS and ventilation times in that arm.\n\nThe authors discuss the pathophysiologic rationale for combining TPE and CVP in severe COVID‑19. In advanced stages, SARS‑CoV‑2 infection can provoke systemic hyperinflammation, cytokine storm, dysregulated coagulation, ARDS, and multiorgan failure. TPE may rapidly remove circulating inflammatory cytokines, pathological coagulation factors, and potentially harmful autoantibodies, while fresh frozen plasma may replenish protective factors such as ADAMTS‑13, protein C, and angiopoietin‑1. Immediately following TPE with CVP transfusion introduces neutralizing antibodies against SARS‑CoV‑2, potentially reducing viral load and shifting the antigen–antibody balance. The authors reference prior work showing improved outcomes with early TPE or CVP alone, and note that their trial is among the first to evaluate a sequential TPE followed by CVP strategy.\n\nThey acknowledge concerns that TPE may also remove beneficial immunoglobulins and complement components, potentially impairing adaptive immunity, but argue that replacement with fresh frozen plasma and subsequent CVP infusion may counterbalance this effect by reintroducing protective factors and virus‑specific antibodies.\n\nThe study concludes that early initiation of TPE followed by CVP transfusion in severe and critical ICU COVID‑19 patients is associated with improved 30‑day survival, better oxygenation, and reduced inflammatory markers, suggesting that this combined approach may represent a viable rescue therapy. Key limitations include the small sample size, single‑centre design, non-randomized allocation, retrospective trial registration, relatively low neutralizing antibody titres in CVP units, and potential confounding from concurrent treatments such as corticosteroids and various antivirals. The authors call for larger randomized controlled trials to confirm these findings and to more precisely define the role of combined TPE and CVP in the management of severe and critically ill COVID‑19 patients.""}","{""conditions"": [""COVID-19"", ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection"", ""Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"", ""Respiratory Failure"", ""Cytokine Release Syndrome"", ""Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome"", ""Coagulopathy""], ""keywords"": [""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""Severe COVID-19"", ""Critical Illness"", ""Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"", ""ARDS"", ""Respiratory Failure"", ""Cytokine Storm"", ""Hyperinflammation"", ""Systemic Inflammation"", ""Coagulopathy"", ""Therapeutic Plasma Exchange"", ""TPE"", ""Plasma Exchange"", ""Convalescent Plasma"", ""CVP"", ""Convalescent Plasma Therapy"", ""Intensive Care Units"", ""ICU"", ""Mechanical Ventilation"", ""High-Flow Nasal Oxygen"", ""C-Reactive Protein"", ""CRP"", ""Lactate Dehydrogenase"", ""LDH"", ""Ferritin"", ""PaO2/FiO2 Ratio"", ""Oxygenation"", ""Rescue Therapy""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""NON_RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Single-centre, prospective, non-randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups: one receiving therapeutic plasma exchange followed by convalescent plasma transfusion plus standard care, and one receiving standard care alone."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Open-label study with no blinding reported for participants, care providers, investigators, or outcome assessors."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 38, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""TPE plus Convalescent Plasma plus Standard Treatment"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Critically ill adults with severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to ICU who received a single therapeutic plasma exchange session within the first 24 hours after ICU admission followed immediately by transfusion of 500 ml ABO-compatible convalescent plasma, in addition to standard COVID-19 treatment (corticosteroids, antiretrovirals, anticoagulants, and antibiotics if needed)."", ""interventionNames"": [""Therapeutic Plasma Exchange"", ""Convalescent Plasma Transfusion"", ""Standard COVID-19 Treatment""]}, {""label"": ""Standard Treatment Only"", ""type"": ""ACTIVE_COMPARATOR"", ""description"": ""Critically ill adults with severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to ICU who received standard COVID-19 treatment alone according to hospital protocols, including corticosteroids, antiretrovirals, anticoagulants, and antibiotics if deemed necessary."", ""interventionNames"": [""Standard COVID-19 Treatment""]}], ""interventions"": [{""type"": ""PROCEDURE"", ""name"": ""Therapeutic Plasma Exchange"", ""description"": ""A single session of therapeutic plasma exchange performed within the first 24 hours after ICU admission using an Infomed HF 440 machine with a plasma/blood separation ratio of 20%.

The objective was to assess whether the NI Diary reliably and validly measures the day‑to‑day impact of nocturia on quality of life and to determine what amount of score change represents a meaningful improvement from the patient’s perspective."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This study performed an independent, treatment‑agnostic psychometric validation of the Nocturia Impact (NI) Diary using data from a multicenter, randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled Phase 2 clinical trial (DAWN; NCT03201419) designed to test a novel pharmacologic treatment for nocturnal polyuria in adults with nocturia. The NI Diary is a 12‑item patient‑reported outcome (PRO) instrument, with 11 core items covering sleep disturbance, emotional disturbance, fatigue, activity limitation, worry, and safety concerns, plus a separate global quality‑of‑life (QoL) item. Items are rated on 5‑point severity scales and summarized into an 11‑item total score (0–44, transformed to 0–100) and a separate transformed QoL item.\n\nAdults with nocturia due primarily to nocturnal polyuria completed the NI Diary and a night‑time voiding diary for three consecutive nights prior to study visits at Baseline and Weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12 (end of treatment). The number of nocturnal voids was averaged across the three nights at each visit. Additional measures included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), patient‑rated nocturnal frequency bother, and Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI‑S) and Improvement (PGI‑I). A subset of 66 patients participated in qualitative exit interviews focused on living with nocturia, the relevance and clarity of NI Diary items, and what constitutes a meaningful change in both NI Diary responses and nocturnal voids.\n\nPsychometric analyses, aligned with FDA 2009 PRO guidance, evaluated: (1) quality and completeness of NI Diary data; (2) item distributions and floor/ceiling effects; (3) inter‑item and item–total correlations; (4) item discrimination indices and category response curves; (5) factorial structure via confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using baseline data; (6) internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha); (7) test–retest reliability using intra‑class correlation coefficients (ICC) in relatively stable subgroups; (8) convergent validity with ISI and nocturia bother scores; (9) known‑groups validity using nocturnal void frequency strata (0–2 vs ≥3 voids/night); and (10) interpretation of score changes, including identification of a meaningful change threshold (MCT) using both anchor‑based and distribution‑based methods, supported by qualitative findings from exit interviews.\n\nThe sample comprised 302 intent‑to‑treat participants (mean age 58.8 years, 59.6% female, predominantly White), which exceeded standard psychometric sample size recommendations (≥10 subjects per item). Overall completion of NI Diary items and three‑night diary sets was high (≈83–84% at baseline and week 12), with low levels of completely missing data. Floor and ceiling effects were observed for some items (notably items 8, 10, and 12), but were generally consistent with expected symptom improvement over time under active study treatment.\n\nAt baseline, corrected item–total correlations ranged from 0.607 to 0.841, and inter‑item correlations from 0.427 to 0.844, supporting that items measure a common underlying construct while covering distinct aspects of nocturia impact. Item discrimination indices ranged from 0.535 to 0.915, indicating very good differentiation across severity levels. CFA supported a unidimensional structure for items 1–11, with excellent CFI and TLI and acceptable RMSEA after allowing two conceptually justifiable residual correlations (between activity‑related items 3 and 4, and between sleep‑related items 7 and 9). This confirmed the scoring of a single total NI impact score and separate treatment of the global QoL item (Q12).\n\nInternal consistency of the 11‑item NI Diary was high (Cronbach’s alpha 0.941). Test–retest reliability over baseline to week 1 in relatively stable patients was strong, with ICC estimates between 0.730 and 0.880 depending on the stability anchor (PGI‑I, PGI‑S, nocturnal voids). Convergent validity was demonstrated by a strong correlation with the Insomnia Severity Index (Spearman’s ρ = 0.730) and a moderate correlation with nocturnal frequency bother (ρ = 0.587), reflecting the expected relationships between nocturia impact, sleep disturbance, and nocturia‑related bother. Known‑groups analyses showed that patients with ≥3 nocturnal voids had significantly higher NI Diary scores than those with 0–2 voids (49.6 vs 41.5 on a 0–100 scale; p = 0.0018; standardized effect size ≈0.37), supporting construct validity.\n\nInterpretation of change focused on defining a patient‑centered meaningful change threshold (MCT) for the NI Diary total score. Anchor‑based analyses used changes from baseline to week 12 in: nocturnal void count, PGI‑S, PGI‑I, PGI‑I as reported in exit interviews, and NI Diary Q12. All anchors showed sufficient correlation with change in NI Diary total score (r ≥ 0.389), allowing their use in MCT estimation. Within‑subject changes in NI Diary total score were examined within anchor‑defined categories of change (e.g., \""no change\"" vs. 1‑category improvement), with standardized effect sizes generally ≥0.5 for the minimal improvement categories. Cumulative distribution function (CDF) curves demonstrated clear separation between no‑change and improvement groups across anchors, with maximal separation around NI Diary change values of roughly −10 to −20 points.\n\nReceiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses evaluated the NI Diary change score cut points that best discriminated patients with varying thresholds of nocturnal void reduction (≥0.5, ≥1.0, ≥1.5, ≥2.5 voids/night). For a ≥1‑void/night reduction—a level patients described as meaningful—the best cut point for NI Diary change was approximately −9.5 to −11.6 points. Distribution‑based indices yielded lower‑bound estimates for true change beyond measurement error (0.5 SD ≈ 10.9 points; SEM ≈ 5.3 points). Exit interview data showed that 81% of patients considered a 1‑point improvement on each item’s response scale to be meaningful; across 11 items this corresponds to an aggregate change of about 11 points on the total score. Patients also qualitatively confirmed that a 1‑void/night reduction was meaningful and associated with better sleep, less fatigue, improved mood, and better daily functioning.\n\nTriangulating across quantitative anchor‑based results, distribution‑based metrics, ROC analyses, and qualitative patient input, the investigators concluded that a reduction of approximately 10–11 points reflects a minimum meaningful within‑patient improvement, and a more conservative responder definition in the range of a 15–18 point reduction on the 0–100 NI Diary total score represents a robust threshold for clinically meaningful benefit. The study thus provides evidence that the NI Diary is a reliable, valid, and interpretable PRO instrument suitable for use as an endpoint in clinical trials and potentially in real‑world studies to quantify the impact of nocturia and treatment‑related improvements in patient quality of life.""}","{""conditions"": [""Nocturia"", ""Nocturnal Polyuria"", ""Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms"", ""Sleep Wake Disorders"", ""Quality of Life""], ""keywords"": [""Nocturia Impact Diary"", ""NI Diary"", ""Nocturnal Polyuria"", ""Nocturia"", ""Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms"", ""Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders"", ""Insomnia Severity Index"", ""Patient-Reported Outcome"", ""Psychometrics"", ""Quality of Life"", ""Patient Global Impression of Severity"", ""Patient Global Impression of Improvement"", ""Voiding Diary""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial with multiple treatment arms run in parallel."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Double-blind, placebo-controlled design; at minimum participants and investigators were blinded to treatment allocation."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT"", ""INVESTIGATOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 302, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Novel drug for nocturnal polyuria"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Participants received a novel investigational pharmacologic treatment for nocturnal polyuria as part of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial.

Participants aged 18 years or older, unvaccinated and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, were enrolled within 120 hours of exposure and randomized 1:1 to receive one unit of high titer CCP or one unit of non-immune control plasma. The main outcome was whether participants developed SARS-CoV-2 infection within 28 days, based on RT-PCR testing of nasal swabs or clinical tests. Among 168 evaluable participants, the rates of infection and symptomatic COVID-19 were similar in the CCP and control groups, and CCP did not significantly prolong infection-free time. CCP appeared safe and was associated with fewer adverse events than control plasma, but it did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection after exposure."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma (CCP) as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for COVID-19. The underlying hypothesis was that passive immunotherapy with high titer anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, delivered as CCP prior to symptom onset or detectable infection, might prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in exposed but uninfected individuals.\n\nAdults aged 18 years or older were eligible if they were asymptomatic, had a close contact exposure to a person with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 within the prior 120 hours, had not received SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and had no history of past or active SARS-CoV-2 infection. All participants had to have a negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result within 24 hours before transfusion. Participants were enrolled at 19 sites across the United States between June 11, 2020, and June 23, 2021.\n\nParticipants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio using web-based systems to receive either one unit of high titer CCP (intervention) or one unit of SARS-CoV-2 non-immune control plasma (placebo). CCP donors had documented prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, met standard blood donation criteria, and were required to have anti–SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers ≥1:320 by Euroimmun ELISA. After the FDA Emergency Use Authorization for CCP, additional criteria included a Euroimmun IgG ratio ≥3.5 at a 1:101 dilution. Control plasma was collected before January 1, 2020 or was confirmed seronegative for SARS-CoV-2. CCP units generally had high anti-spike IgG endpoint titers (mostly >1:1000) and neutralizing antibody titers typically between 1:20 and 1:640.\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was incident SARS-CoV-2 infection through day 28, as determined by positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR from scheduled study nasal swabs or clinical testing performed outside the study. Follow-up visits were scheduled at days 0 (transfusion), 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, 60, and 90. Nasal swabs for viral testing were obtained at screening (days −1 to 0) and on days 1, 7, 14, and 28. Symptomatic infection (COVID-19) was assessed repeatedly through day 60. A secondary clinical endpoint was disease severity through day 28, measured by an ordinal clinical event scale ranging from no infection to death.\n\nThe primary analysis used a modified intention-to-treat population, including all randomized and transfused participants who were RT-PCR negative at baseline. Time-to-event methods were employed, with restricted mean infection-free time (RMIFT) by day 28 as the primary measure. Targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) was used to estimate differences in RMIFT and risk differences between groups, adjusting for prognostic baseline variables identified via random survival forests. Analyses were also repeated considering only symptomatic COVID-19 as the event and in a pre-specified sensitivity analysis restricted to participants who remained infection-free through day 4 to account for a potential delay in CCP effect.\n\nOf 1,138 screened individuals, 180 were enrolled and randomized, and 170 were transfused (82 CCP, 88 control). Two transfused participants were excluded from efficacy analyses due to baseline RT-PCR positivity, yielding 168 participants in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (81 CCP, 87 control). The median time from exposure to transfusion was 2 days (IQR 1–4). Seven participants did not complete all study procedures but contributed follow-up time until loss to follow-up.\n\nFor the primary endpoint, 12 of 81 (14.8%) CCP recipients and 13 of 87 (14.9%) control recipients developed RT-PCR–confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by day 28. The RMIFT through 28 days was 25.3 days in the CCP arm and 25.2 days in the control arm, with no significant difference between groups (p-values around 0.47–0.49; risk difference approximately 0.01 in favor of CCP, not statistically significant). When infections detected on days 1–3 were excluded to allow time for passive antibody effect, RMIFT increased slightly in the CCP group relative to control, but differences remained non-significant.\n\nSymptomatic COVID-19 developed in 6 of 81 (7.4%) CCP recipients and 7 of 87 (8.0%) control recipients. The RMIFT for symptomatic COVID-19 by day 28 was 26.3 days for CCP versus 25.9 days for control, again indicating no statistically significant prophylactic benefit. Two COVID-19-related hospitalizations occurred, both in control plasma recipients; none occurred among CCP recipients, but numbers were too small to draw firm efficacy conclusions for severe outcomes.\n\nDisease severity assessed by the ordinal clinical event scale was similar between the two arms, with odds ratios close to 1 for both all post-transfusion events and events occurring more than 3 days after transfusion. Analyses examining relationships between donor antibody titers (including anti-spike and anti-RBD IgG AUC measures) and infection risk among CCP recipients found no significant association and no clear dose–response relationship.\n\nSafety was a key component of the trial. Adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and transfusion reactions were systematically collected and reviewed by an independent, blinded safety monitor. Overall, 86 AEs were reported: 58 in CCP recipients and 28 in control plasma recipients, with 17 grade 3 or 4 events. Five participants required hospitalization (including two for COVID-19), all in the control group. CCP recipients had a lower proportion of any AEs and a trend toward fewer severe AEs. There was no evidence of antibody-dependent enhancement or other safety signals related to CCP administration, including in the early period following transfusion.\n\nThe trial did not reach its planned sample size of 500 transfused participants due to declining enrollment with widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine-related eligibility constraints. A prespecified conditional power analysis indicated that even if the target sample size had been achieved, the probability of demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in infection with CCP PEP would have been very low.\n\nIn summary, this trial demonstrates that administration of a single unit of high titer SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma as post-exposure prophylaxis within 120 hours of close contact exposure is safe but does not significantly reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection or symptomatic COVID-19 in generally healthy, unvaccinated adults. The findings suggest that the antibody dose and composition achievable with standard single-unit CCP may be insufficient to prevent upper respiratory tract infection, especially compared with higher-dose monoclonal antibody regimens. Future prophylaxis studies may need to explore higher antibody doses, multiple units, very high-titer CCP, or targeting high-risk populations such as immunocompromised or elderly individuals, focusing on clinically meaningful outcomes such as hospitalization and severe disease.""}","{""conditions"": [""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2 Infection""], ""keywords"": [""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""Coronavirus Infections"", ""Convalescent Plasma"", ""Passive Immunization"", ""Post-Exposure Prophylaxis"", ""Monoclonal Antibodies"", ""Antibodies, Neutralizing"", ""Immunoglobulin G"", ""Respiratory Tract Infections"", ""Randomized Controlled Trial"", ""Plasma Transfusion""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Two-arm, parallel-group trial comparing a single unit of high-titer SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma versus a single unit of non-immune control plasma as post-exposure prophylaxis."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""PREVENTION"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Double-blind, placebo-controlled trial; convalescent and control plasma were provided in identical standard plasma bags with identical labels, masking participants and trial personnel."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT"", ""CARE_PROVIDER"", ""INVESTIGATOR"", ""OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 180, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Convalescent Plasma"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Participants received a single transfusion of 1 unit of high-titer SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma (CCP).

A total of 390 outpatients aged 18–45 years with clinically diagnosed neurotic disorders and clinically significant anxiety (HADS-A ≥ 11) were randomized to receive Tenoten at two dosing regimens (4 or 8 tablets per day) or matching placebo for 12 weeks. The main hypothesis was that Tenoten would reduce anxiety severity, measured by change in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) scores, more than placebo while being well tolerated."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted at 23 sites in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan from February 2017 to September 2018 to investigate the safety and efficacy of Tenoten in treating anxiety in adults with somatoform dysfunction (SfD), reactions to severe stress (RSS), adjustment disorders (AjD), and other neurotic disorders (oNDs).\n\nTenoten is an anxiolytic drug containing highly diluted antibodies to the S100 protein, manufactured under GMP conditions and registered as a conventional drug in the European Economic Community. Preclinical and prior clinical data suggested stress-protective, anxiolytic, antidepressant, antiamnestic, and neuroprotective properties, with a safety profile comparable or superior to standard anxiolytics.\n\nEligible participants were outpatients aged 18–45 years with ICD-10 diagnoses of SfD (F45.0, F45.1, F45.2, F45.4, F45.8, F45.9), RSS and AjD (F43.0, F43.1, F43.2, F43.8, F43.9), or other neurotic disorders (F48.8, F48.9), and with anxiety scores ≥ 11 on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale—Anxiety subscale (HADS-A). Patients with significant depressive symptoms (HADS-D ≥ 11), other mental disorders, serious somatic or neurological diseases, substance use disorders, pregnancy, or breastfeeding were excluded. Psycholeptics, psychoanaleptics, antiepileptics, anticholinergics, dopaminergic agents, antioxidants, hormones, and psychotherapy were not allowed for 4 months before and during the trial.\n\nParticipants were randomized in a 1:1:0.5:0.5 ratio into four groups using an interactive randomization system: Tenoten group 1 (2 tablets twice daily; 4 tablets/day), Tenoten group 3 (2 tablets four times daily; 8 tablets/day), and two placebo groups (2 and 4), which were later combined for analysis. Tenoten and placebo tablets were identical in appearance and organoleptic properties. The treatment period lasted 12 weeks, with visits every 4 weeks. At baseline and follow-up visits, investigators assessed anxiety with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and documented medications and safety events. Patients also completed HADS and EQ-5D-3L; the Clinical Global Impression–Efficacy Index (CGI-EI) and EQ-5D-3L were evaluated at the final visit.\n\nThe primary endpoint was the change from baseline in mean HAM-A total score after 12 weeks of treatment in the Tenoten 4-tablet and 8-tablet groups compared with placebo. Exploratory endpoints included HAM-A changes after 4 and 8 weeks, the proportion of treatment responders (≥ 50% reduction in HAM-A score), the percentage of patients achieving remission of anxiety (HAM-A < 14) at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, changes in quality of life by EQ-5D-3L, and CGI-EI scores. Post hoc analyses explored the influence of specific diagnostic categories (F43, F45, F48) on overall HAM-A dynamics, item subscores (especially somatic items 7–13), and on placebo effects.\n\nSample size planning targeted control of type I error (0.05 overall, with α = 0.0166 per primary hypothesis) and type II error (0.2). Assumptions included a >4-point expected difference in HAM-A reduction between each Tenoten group and placebo and <3-point difference between Tenoten dose regimens, with variance of HAM-A change estimated as 44 and anticipated dropout <20%. ANCOVA was used to analyze changes from baseline, with normality assessed and Yeo–Johnson transformation applied if needed; nonparametric tests and Fisher’s exact test were used for categorical and non-normal data, and mixed or multinomial ANOVA for post hoc analyses.\n\nOf the 390 enrolled patients (safety population), 384 with HADS-A ≥ 11 formed the intention-to-treat (ITT) set, and 344 the per-protocol (PP) set. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, including diagnostic category distributions and HAM-A and EQ-5D-3L scores, were comparable across groups.\n\nAfter 12 weeks, mean HAM-A scores decreased from 18.81 ± 5.81 to 7.26 ± 4.63 in the Tenoten 4-tablet group and from 18.38 ± 4.3 to 6.40 ± 4.02 in the Tenoten 8-tablet group, compared with 8.48 ± 5.13 in the placebo group. Mean reductions were 11.25, 11.91, and 9.71 points for Tenoten 4-tablet, Tenoten 8-tablet, and placebo groups, respectively, with statistically significant differences favoring Tenoten over placebo (p = 0.0055 for 4 tablets/day; p < 0.0001 for 8 tablets/day). Remission of anxiety (HAM-A < 14) at week 12 was observed in 88.1% and 96.2% of the Tenoten 4- and 8-tablet groups, respectively, with superiority of the 8-tablet regimen over placebo. Responder rates at week 12 were 69.8% and 73.8% in the 4- and 8-tablet groups, versus 53.9% with placebo.\n\nQuality of life (EQ-5D-3L) improved in all groups, with a significantly greater improvement in the Tenoten 8-tablet group compared to placebo. CGI-EI scores indicated a more favorable efficacy-to-side-effect ratio for both Tenoten regimens versus placebo.\n\nPost hoc analyses suggested that diagnostic category (F43 vs F45 vs F48) did not significantly modify the treatment-related improvement in overall HAM-A scores, although baseline and mean anxiety and somatic subscores differed across diagnoses. Changes in anxious mood and tension (HAM-A questions 1–2) were driven by treatment rather than diagnosis. Somatic symptom dynamics (HAM-A items 7–13) differed by treatment regardless of diagnosis, with notably higher somatic subscores in somatoform dysfunction (F45) patients.\n\nSafety analyses showed 46 adverse events in 37 patients (10 events in Tenoten 4-tablet, 18 in Tenoten 8-tablet, and 18 in placebo groups). AEs were predominantly mild or moderate; no serious adverse events occurred, and overall AE frequency did not differ significantly among groups. Most AEs were assessed as unrelated or unlikely related to Tenoten, with no events definitely attributed to the study drug. The safety profile was considered favorable, with a high compliance index (~100%).\n\nThe authors concluded that Tenoten at both 4- and 8-tablet daily regimens was more effective than placebo in reducing anxiety in adults with somatoform dysfunction, reactions to severe stress, adjustment disorders, and other neurotic disorders, with good tolerability. They noted limitations including inclusion of heterogeneous psychiatric diagnoses, conduct mainly in neurological centers without standardized psychiatric interviews, fixed-dose regimens without adjustment, and a relatively high placebo effect potentially influenced by investigator–patient interactions.

Using a hybrid type 2, stepped‑wedge cluster randomized trial across five primary care clinics, the study will evaluate whether co‑created implementation supports (short video trainings, an implementation coach, a technology‑based screening algorithm, and written protocols) increase fidelity to the ACE screening protocol and the reach of screening among children ages 0–5. It will also assess the impact on child mental health referrals and psychosocial symptom outcomes, as well as the feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability of the approach within a large FQHC system."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This protocol describes a hybrid effectiveness‑implementation (type 2) study designed to support and evaluate the implementation of California’s ACEs Aware policy in a large Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) system serving predominantly low‑income, racial and ethnic minority families. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are common, particularly in marginalized communities, and are associated with toxic stress and a wide range of adverse mental and physical health outcomes across the lifespan. In California, a statewide policy provides Medicaid reimbursement for ACE screening using the PEARLS tool in pediatric primary care, but policy alone has not consistently led to effective screening, referrals, or improved access to care.\n\nThe study’s overall objective is to co‑create, refine, and test a tailored, multicomponent implementation strategy that enhances FQHC capacity to integrate universal ACE screening into routine pediatric care for children ages 0–5 years. The strategy is developed using Implementation Mapping, guided by the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework, and involves extensive stakeholder engagement, including FQHC leadership and staff, a Trauma Informed Care workgroup, and caregivers.\n\nThe implementation strategy includes: (1) brief online video trainings for clinic personnel on ACEs, trauma‑informed administration of caregiver‑reported screening tools, and clinic workflows; (2) technical implementation support through an FQHC‑based implementation coach and an interprofessional Trauma Informed Care workgroup; (3) incorporation of the Pediatric Symptoms Checklist (PSC) to assess child psychosocial functioning, complementing the state‑mandated PEARLS ACE exposure screener and ACE‑associated health conditions checklist; and (4) a technology‑based screening algorithm hosted in a secure REDCap application, running on tablets, that combines PEARLS scores, ACE‑associated health conditions, and PSC scores to generate child risk categories (low, intermediate, high) and recommended follow‑up actions. The algorithm is pre‑tested and refined with FQHC champions and then beta‑tested in a non‑trial clinic.\n\nAim 1 focuses on refining the implementation strategy and ACE algorithm using a participatory Implementation Mapping process. Workgroup meetings with FQHC staff and separate groups with caregivers are conducted in English and Spanish to identify barriers, facilitators, preferred workflows, and enhancements to the caregiver experience during ACE screening. Outputs include a detailed implementation protocol and logic model that specifies implementation objectives, determinants, strategies, and hypothesized mechanisms of action.\n\nAim 2 is a pilot stepped‑wedge cluster randomized pragmatic trial across five FQHC clinics. Clinics transition from control (standard care, including any existing ACEs Aware protocol use) to intervention (standard care plus the multifaceted implementation strategy) at different 10‑week time points, over six 10‑week periods (total 15 months). Approximately 900–1,770 well‑child visits for children 0–5 years are expected across the trial. Control periods include usual developmental and behavioral screening, clinician discussions, and any state ACE protocol activities the clinic has already adopted (PEARLS, ACE‑related health conditions checklist, wellness exam, and education). In intervention periods, the formal implementation supports are added.\n\nCaregivers of eligible children (0–5 years, English or Spanish speaking, primary decision‑maker) complete PEARLS and PSC instruments via tablet during well‑child visits, after informed consent. The ACE algorithm automatically scores the instruments and classifies risk: low risk (no ACEs and low PSC), intermediate risk (1–3 ACEs, no ACE‑associated physical condition, low PSC), or high risk (e.g., 4+ ACEs and ACE‑associated condition and elevated PSC, or combinations indicating high psychosocial risk). Risk categories and suggested follow‑up actions are communicated to the primary care provider, who uses this information for family education, clinical decision‑making, mental health referral, and documentation for reimbursement.\n\nPrimary implementation outcomes at the clinic level are: (1) reach—the proportion of eligible children who complete ACE screening; and (2) fidelity to ACE screening protocols, assessed via observation checklists conducted by the implementation coach. A key clinical outcome at the clinic level is the rate of child mental health referrals (e.g., to behavioral health, social work, developmental services) among eligible children, especially those at high risk. Secondary outcomes include feasibility and acceptability of the ACE policy and implementation strategy, measured using brief validated scales administered to clinic personnel.\n\nChild‑level clinical outcomes include changes in psychosocial functioning as measured by PSC scores before and after screening among children identified at high or intermediate risk. Additional quantitative measures include child socio‑demographic characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, preferred language, birth in the USA) and clinic context variables. Implementation leadership and implementation climate within clinics are measured using validated scales to explore whether they mediate the relationship between the implementation strategy and outcomes such as feasibility, acceptability, fidelity, and reach.\n\nQuantitative data sources include the FQHC electronic medical record (EMR) system (e.g., screening completion, ACE‑associated health conditions, referrals, socio‑demographics), REDCap screening data, staff surveys, and fidelity checklists. Statistical analyses use generalized linear mixed models appropriate for stepped‑wedge cluster randomized trials, with random effects for clinics and fixed effects for time and intervention status. Analyses adjust for child sociodemographic variables and consider potential confounding by secular trends over calendar time. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses (including multiple imputation for missing data) are planned. The study is powered primarily to detect differences in screening reach between intervention and control periods.\n\nQualitative data are collected via semi‑structured interviews with caregivers who participated in ACE screening and with clinic personnel involved in implementation. Interviews explore perceptions of the ACE policy and screening process, trauma‑informed care considerations, inner and outer context barriers and facilitators, workflow challenges, financial implications, and suggestions for improving the implementation strategy. Transcripts are analyzed using a framework‑informed, largely deductive coding approach based on EPIS and Implementation Mapping constructs, with thematic analysis supported by double coding and assessment of inter‑rater reliability.\n\nThe study aims to demonstrate how a co‑created, tailored implementation strategy can increase the fidelity and reach of ACE screening, improve mental health referral patterns, and potentially improve psychosocial outcomes among young children in safety‑net primary care settings. It also seeks to generate knowledge about how implementation leadership, climate, and technology‑enabled workflows can support policy‑driven innovations in complex, resource‑constrained healthcare systems. Findings will inform potential scale‑up within the partner FQHC system and dissemination to other FQHCs and policy stakeholders, including the California Office of the Surgeon General and the ACEs Aware initiative.""}","{""conditions"": [""Adverse Childhood Experiences"", ""Toxic Stress"", ""Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorders"", ""Child Behavior Disorders"", ""Anxiety Disorders"", ""Depressive Disorder"", ""Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders"", ""Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity"", ""Asthma"", ""Cardiovascular Diseases""], ""keywords"": [""Adverse Childhood Experiences"", ""ACEs"", ""Toxic Stress"", ""Child Abuse"", ""Trauma-Informed Care"", ""Pediatric Primary Care"", ""Mental Health Screening"", ""Pediatric Symptoms Checklist"", ""PEARLS"", ""Medicaid"", ""Health Policy"", ""Implementation Science"", ""Implementation Mapping"", ""EPIS framework"", ""Stepped-Wedge Cluster Randomized Trial"", ""Federally Qualified Health Centers"", ""FQHC"", ""Health Services Accessibility"", ""Low-Income Population"", ""Minority Health""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""CROSSOVER"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Hybrid type 2 stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial with five primary care clinics (clusters).

Volunteers ingested Bl-04 or placebo daily for 28 days and were then experimentally infected intranasally with rhinovirus type A39 and followed for 14 days to assess infection, cold symptoms, and immune responses. The primary objective was to determine if Bl-04 lowers the incidence of rhinovirus-associated illness; secondary and exploratory objectives included evaluating viral shedding, symptom severity and duration, nasal cytokine responses, blood transcriptomic changes, and nasal, throat, and fecal microbiota profiles. The study found no evidence that Bl-04 reduced rhinovirus infection or illness, nor did it produce clinically meaningful changes in host immune responses or microbiota composition."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This study investigated the effects of the probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04 on experimentally induced rhinovirus infection and illness in healthy adults using a well-established human rhinovirus (RV) challenge model. The rationale was based on prior, inconsistent evidence suggesting that certain probiotics may modulate host immunity and reduce the incidence or severity of viral upper respiratory tract infections, including the common cold, but with limited mechanistic data and variable study quality.\n\nHealthy volunteers aged 18–60 years, primarily from a university community, were screened for susceptibility to rhinovirus type A39, defined as a serum neutralizing antibody titer ≤1:4. Eligible participants without significant underlying respiratory or gastrointestinal disease and without acute illness were randomized 1:1, using a computer-generated block randomization scheme, to receive either Bl-04 or placebo. The active product consisted of a daily sachet containing at least 2 × 10^9 colony-forming units of Bl-04 mixed with 1 g of sucrose; the placebo sachet contained 1 g of sucrose alone. Supplements were indistinguishable in appearance, smell, and taste. Study staff and participants were blinded to allocation.\n\nSupplementation began 28 days prior to viral challenge (day −28) and continued through 14 days after challenge (day 14). Participants attended several visits between day −28 and day 0 for compliance checks and resupply of study product and were instructed to avoid other probiotics, probiotic-containing foods, antibiotics, and anti-inflammatory medications during the supplementation period. Compliance was monitored by counting returned sachets and confirmed in the active group by detecting Bl-04 in stool using strain-specific qPCR.\n\nOn day 0, after 28 days of supplementation, all participants were inoculated intranasally with 20–100 TCID50 of rhinovirus A39 using drops prepared under GMP conditions and tested under an FDA IND. Nasal lavage samples collected on day 0 were screened for other respiratory viruses by multiplex PCR to exclude concurrent infections. Post-challenge nasal lavage specimens were collected on days 1–5 for RV culture and quantification of viral titers. Serum collected before and after challenge was tested for neutralizing antibody; infection was defined by either virus isolation from post-challenge nasal lavages or a ≥4-fold rise in RV-A39 neutralizing antibody titer.\n\nClinical symptoms typical of the common cold (nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, sneezing, headache, myalgia, chilliness) were assessed using a modified Jackson score. Symptoms were scored daily by staff interview on days 1–5 and self-recorded in diaries on days 6–14, using a 0–4 scale (absent to very severe). Total symptom scores over the first 5 days and over days 1–14 were calculated. A protocol-defined rhinovirus-associated illness required both virologically confirmed infection and a clinical illness meeting prespecified criteria: a total symptom score of at least 6 plus either at least three days of rhinorrhea or the participant’s subjective impression of having had a cold.\n\nThe primary outcome was the incidence of rhinovirus-associated illness in the per-protocol population, which included participants who were susceptible at baseline, had no other virus detected at day 0, were infected with RV-A39, completed follow-up, and took at least 80% of the assigned doses. Secondary endpoints included incidence of RV infection, presence and magnitude of viral shedding in nasal secretions, duration of illness among those who became ill, and total symptom scores over days 1–5 and 1–14. The incidence of RV-associated illness was compared between groups using chi-square tests; symptom scores were analyzed using Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations; duration of illness was compared with Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests; and viral titers were analyzed with repeated-measures ANOVA. A hierarchical testing strategy was used to control type I error among secondary endpoints.\n\nTo explore potential mechanisms of action, several immunologic and microbiome measures were evaluated. Nasal lavage samples collected longitudinally (day −28, 0, and post-challenge) were analyzed for cytokines and chemokines, including IL-8/CXCL8, IL-1β, IL-6, G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, IFN-γ, and IL-10 using ELISA and multiplex platforms. Changes in these mediators from pre-supplementation to pre-challenge and from post-challenge time points were compared between treatment arms with repeated-measures ANCOVA.\n\nPeripheral blood samples collected in PAXgene tubes on days −28, 0, and 2 post-challenge were analyzed by targeted transcriptomics using a panel of inflammatory and antiviral genes. Differential gene expression was assessed between active and placebo groups, between infected and uninfected participants, and between those who developed rhinovirus-associated illness and those who did not. Pathway analyses examined functional categories such as immune responses, cell signaling, and inflammatory pathways.\n\nMicrobiota composition of the nose, throat, and gut was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing (V4 region; QIIME2). Nasal swabs were collected on days −28, 0, and 3; throat swabs on days −28, 0, 3, 5, and 14; and a fecal sample on day 0. Alpha diversity and beta diversity were compared between treatment arms and across time. Differential abundance analyses examined whether probiotic supplementation affected specific bacterial taxa. The potential influence of baseline (day −28 or day 0) abundance of key nasal genera (e.g., Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Moraxella, Alloiococcus) and dominant fecal genera (e.g., Blautia, Faecalibacterium, Coprococcus) on clinical endpoints such as total symptom scores and illness duration was evaluated using regression models, including interaction terms with treatment where relevant. Strain-specific PCR methods were used to detect Bl-04 in stool and upper airway samples. Throat swabs were also screened by qPCR for DNA of potentially pathogenic bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes group A).\n\nSafety was assessed in all participants who received study product (165 active, 169 placebo). Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) were collected at each visit and coded using MedDRA. Investigators judged the relatedness of AEs to study interventions (supplementation, procedures, viral challenge) while blinded to treatment allocation.\n\nA total of 334 participants were randomized; 318 completed the study. The per-protocol population comprised 232 participants (112 active, 120 placebo). The incidence of protocol-defined rhinovirus-associated illness did not differ significantly between groups: 56% (95% CI, 47–66%) in the active group versus 50% (95% CI, 41–59%) in the placebo group (χ² = 0.91, p = 0.34). The difference in illness rates (active minus placebo) was 6.3% (95% CI, −6.7 to 19.1). RV infection, confirmed by culture or serology, occurred in 86% of active and 80% of placebo participants (p = 0.25), and proportions of participants with detectable virus in nasal secretions or with seroconversion were also similar. Quantitative viral titers in nasal lavage over days 1–5 post-challenge were comparable between groups.\n\nSymptom burden and illness duration were not improved by Bl-04. Mean daily total symptom scores over days 1–5 and 1–14, analyzed via Poisson regression, showed no significant differences between active and placebo. Among those who developed rhinovirus-associated illness, the median duration of illness was 11.0 days in the active group and 11.5 days in the placebo group, with no significant difference.\n\nExploratory analyses of nasal cytokines showed that IL-1β levels increased modestly more from day −28 to day 0 in the active group compared with placebo, suggesting a small pre-challenge proinflammatory effect; however, no consistent or clinically meaningful probiotic-induced differences were found in nasal cytokine responses to rhinovirus infection across the measured mediators. Blood transcriptomic analyses revealed strong transcriptional responses to infection (hundreds of genes up- or down-regulated on day 2 in infected vs. non-infected participants), predominantly in immune and inflammatory pathways, but no genes were differentially expressed between Bl-04 and placebo groups at any time point.\n\nMicrobiome analysis indicated that oral Bl-04 supplementation had minimal impact on nasal and fecal microbiota composition or diversity. In the throat, alpha diversity modestly decreased in the probiotic group and increased in the placebo group between day −28 and day 0, but overall taxonomic profiles (e.g., Streptococcus, Prevotella, Veillonella, Actinomyces) remained similar. The nasal microbiota, dominated by genera such as Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Alloiococcus, Haemophilus, Streptococcus, Peptoniphilus, and Moraxella, showed no major shifts attributable to Bl-04 or to the rhinovirus infection itself. Certain baseline microbiota features—such as higher fecal Blautia abundance associating with lower total symptom scores and higher Faecalibacterium abundance associating with longer illness duration—suggest that host microbiome composition may influence individual responses to viral challenge, but these associations were independent of probiotic supplementation.\n\nSafety analyses indicated that Bl-04 was well tolerated. A small number of AEs judged definitely or probably related to study interventions occurred in both arms (2% in active vs. 4% in placebo), primarily attributable to study procedures or the viral infection itself. No AEs were judged definitely or probably related to ingestion of the probiotic.\n\nOverall, this large, rigorously conducted rhinovirus challenge study found no effectiveness of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04 in preventing or mitigating RV-A39 infection or rhinovirus-associated illness in healthy adults. The probiotic did not produce meaningful changes in systemic or mucosal immune markers or in the nasopharyngeal and fecal microbiota that would explain a protective mechanism. Together with previous data, these findings suggest that orally administered Bl-04 is unlikely to provide clinically important benefit in the prevention or treatment of rhinovirus-induced common colds, and they highlight the need for further research into the mechanisms and strain-specific effects of probiotics in respiratory viral infections.""}","{""conditions"": [""Common Cold"", ""Rhinovirus Infections"", ""Respiratory Tract Infections"", ""Upper Respiratory Tract Infections""], ""keywords"": [""Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis"", ""Bl-04"", ""Probiotics"", ""Rhinovirus A39"", ""Human rhinovirus"", ""Common cold"", ""Viral respiratory infection"", ""Upper respiratory tract infection"", ""Nasal microbiota"", ""Gut microbiota"", ""Throat microbiota"", ""Microbiome"", ""Cytokines"", ""Innate immunity"", ""Viral shedding"", ""Experimental infection"", ""Challenge study""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Two-arm, parallel-group trial in which healthy adults were randomized 1:1 to ingest Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04 or placebo for 28 days before and 14 days after experimental rhinovirus (RV-A39) challenge."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""PREVENTION"", ""observationalModel"": ""COHORT"", ""timePerspective"": ""PROSPECTIVE"", ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Randomized, double-blinded challenge study; volunteers and all study personnel involved in conduct and analysis were blinded to group assignment until database lock."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT"", ""INVESTIGATOR"", ""OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 334, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Bl-04 Probiotic"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Participants received oral Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04 daily for 28 days prior to and through 14 days after experimental rhinovirus A39 challenge.

Although these biomarkers correlated well with chronological age, no significant differences in epigenetic age measures were found between intervention arms over 6 months."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This study is a post-hoc analysis of a previously conducted randomized controlled trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01302379) that employed a 2×2 factorial design in overweight or obese postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. In the parent trial, 333 participants were randomized to one of four 6‑month interventions: daily metformin, placebo, a weight loss program with metformin, or a weight loss program with placebo. The weight loss intervention included a calorie goal and a moderate-intensity physical activity goal of 300 minutes per week delivered via a phone-based program.\n\nFor this epigenetic aging analysis, DNA methylation data were generated for 192 randomly selected participants using buffy coat DNA from fasting blood samples collected at baseline and at the 6‑month visit. DNA was processed with bisulfite conversion and profiled on the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. After quality control and probe filtering, 818,493 CpG probes remained for analysis. Beta values were normalized using functional normalization in the Bioconductor package \""minfi.\"" Nine epigenetic aging (EA) measures were computed: DNAmAge Hannum, DNAmAge Horvath, DNAm SkinBloodClock, DNAm PhenoAge, DNAm GrimAge, DNA methylation-based telomere length (DNAm TL), EpiTOC, EpiTOC2, and MiAge. EpiTOC/EpiTOC2 and MiAge were calculated using published R code, and the remaining clocks were computed via a public online calculator.\n\nThe primary objective was to examine whether 6 months of metformin therapy and/or weight loss would decelerate epigenetic aging, as reflected by age-adjusted epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) measures in leukocytes, compared with placebo. Unadjusted and adjusted linear mixed-effects models with a random intercept for participant were used to assess baseline-to-end-of-study changes in each EAA marker, comparing the three active intervention arms (weight loss only, metformin only, and weight loss plus metformin) versus placebo. Adjusted models included covariates for days from randomization to the final visit and DNA methylation-derived leukocyte composition. Sensitivity analyses restricted to participants with high adherence (≥5% weight loss and/or ≥80% pill adherence) were also conducted.\n\nAll epigenetic age measures showed significant correlations with chronological age, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.20 to 0.86. DNAm SkinBloodClock and DNAm GrimAge displayed the strongest positive correlations with age, while DNAm TL was negatively correlated, as expected for a telomere length proxy. Despite this, no intervention arm showed statistically significant differences or consistent trends in any epigenetic aging biomarker compared with placebo in either intent-to-treat or adherence-based analyses. A nominal association between high-adherence weight loss and accelerated epigenetic aging was observed for some measures (e.g., PhenoAge, DNAm TL), but these findings were opposite to the hypothesized direction and unlikely to remain significant after correction for multiple comparisons.\n\nThe investigators interpret the lack of significant effects as possibly reflecting insufficient intervention duration, tissue specificity of epigenetic clocks (leukocytes vs. other tissues such as liver), the relatively large measurement error of current clocks (often exceeding one year), and limited statistical power for detecting short-term changes. They also speculate that in older, overweight/obese cancer survivors, weight loss might worsen sarcopenia and muscle-fat imbalance, potentially contributing to increased biological aging in some contexts.\n\nThe study concludes that in this population of postmenopausal breast cancer survivors, six months of metformin and/or behavioral weight loss did not produce detectable changes in leukocyte epigenetic aging. The authors emphasize the need for longer-duration trials, better tissue targeting for epigenetic measurements, and consideration of body composition (muscle vs. fat) when designing interventions aimed at modifying biological aging as measured by DNA methylation-based clocks.""}","{""conditions"": [""Breast Neoplasms"", ""Overweight"", ""Obesity"", ""Aging"", ""Epigenesis, Genetic""], ""keywords"": [""breast cancer survivors"", ""postmenopausal"", ""metformin"", ""weight loss"", ""obesity"", ""overweight"", ""epigenetic aging"", ""epigenetic clocks"", ""DNA methylation"", ""biological aging"", ""Hannum epigenetic clock"", ""Horvath epigenetic clock"", ""SkinBloodClock"", ""PhenoAge"", ""GrimAge"", ""DNA methylation-based telomere length"", ""DNAm TL"", ""EpiTOC"", ""EpiTOC2"", ""MiAge"", ""mitotic age"", ""telomere length"", ""leukocytes"", ""randomized controlled trial""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""FACTORIAL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Randomized controlled trial with a 2×2 factorial design assigning overweight/obese postmenopausal breast cancer survivors to metformin, placebo, weight loss with metformin, or weight loss with placebo for 6 months."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Metformin versus placebo was conducted in a blinded fashion; participants and care providers were masked to metformin vs placebo assignment.

After achieving and maintaining hypothermia at 33 °C for 24 hours using a closed-loop cooling device, patients were randomly assigned to be rewarmed at either 0.25 °C per hour or 0.50 °C per hour, then maintained at 37 °C for 24 hours. The main measure was the level of the inflammatory marker interleukin-6 (IL-6) between 24 and 48 hours after reaching 33 °C. The study found no significant difference in IL-6 levels, neuroinjury biomarkers, or 90-day neurological outcomes between the two rewarming rates, suggesting that slower active rewarming from 33 °C did not improve inflammatory or functional outcomes in this population."", ""detailedDescription"": ""The ISOCRATe (Impact of Speed Of rewarming after CaRdiac ArresT(e)) trial was an investigator-initiated, pilot, parallel-group, randomized controlled study conducted in a French medical-surgical intensive care unit. The trial addressed a specific component of targeted temperature management (TTM) after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA): the optimal rate of active rewarming from therapeutic hypothermia at 33 °C.\n\nAdult patients (≥18 years) who were unconscious (Glasgow Coma Scale ≤8) after OHCA with an initial shockable rhythm (ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia) and treated with TTM at 33 °C using a closed-loop cooling device (Artic Sun) were eligible. Exclusion criteria included prolonged no-flow (>10 min) or low-flow (>60 min) times, severe hemodynamic instability requiring high-dose vasopressors, delay >300 minutes from arrest to inclusion, moribund status, advanced liver disease (Child–Pugh C), current treatment with IL-6 receptor antagonists or high-dose corticosteroids, pregnancy, incarceration, previous enrollment in another cardiac arrest RCT with 90-day functional outcome as the primary endpoint, lack of statutory health insurance, or refusal by next of kin.\n\nTTM was protocolized: rapid induction of hypothermia to 33 °C, followed by 24 hours of maintenance at 33 °C, with esophageal temperature monitoring. Sedation was standardized using midazolam and sufentanil to achieve deep sedation (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale −5), and shivering was managed with a stepwise protocol including additional sedatives, opioids, and neuromuscular blockade (cisatracurium) as needed. Life-sustaining treatment withdrawal followed guideline-based multimodal neuroprognostication.\n\nRandomization occurred 18–24 hours after reaching 33 °C, at the end of the maintenance phase, to avoid including patients who died during induction or maintenance and therefore could not contribute IL-6 data. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio via a web-based system to one of two rewarming strategies: (1) slow rewarming at 0.25 °C/h to 37 °C, then maintenance at 37 °C for 24 hours; or (2) faster rewarming at 0.50 °C/h to 37 °C, then maintenance at 37 °C for 24 hours. Treating clinicians were not blinded due to the nature of the intervention, but the psychologist assessing 90-day outcomes was blinded to treatment allocation.\n\nThe primary endpoint was systemic inflammation assessed by serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels between 24 and 48 hours after reaching 33 °C. IL-6 was measured at achievement of 33 °C (H0) and at 12, 24, 36, 40, and 48 hours thereafter using a Luminex Magpix-based assay, but only post-randomization values (24–48 hours) were analyzed. The primary analysis used the area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) for IL-6 from 24 to 48 hours, calculated by the trapezoidal rule and compared between groups using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.\n\nSecondary outcomes included: (1) neurological functional outcome at day 90, measured by the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scale, with favorable outcome defined as CPC 1–2; (2) ICU mortality and hospital (day-90) mortality; (3) ICU length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation; and (4) additional biomarker profiles. Other inflammatory and injury biomarkers (IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor, TNF-α, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin) were assayed at the same time points as IL-6. Serum neurofilament light chain (NF-L) at 48 hours and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) at 48 and 72 hours after OHCA were measured as markers of neuronal injury. Some biomarker outcomes were dichotomized against the lower limit of detection, and others were analyzed as continuous variables.\n\nSample size was calculated for the IL-6 endpoint, assuming a 15% difference in mean IL-6 at 48 hours between groups, strong within-patient correlation of repeated IL-6 values, and a standard deviation based on prior data, with α=0.05 and β=0.10. This yielded 25 randomized patients per arm. Anticipating approximately 20% pre-randomization mortality, investigators planned to enroll 60 patients; ultimately, 58 were included and 50 randomized.\n\nAmong the 50 randomized patients (25 per group), baseline characteristics, cardiac arrest parameters (e.g., location, bystander CPR, initial rhythm, epinephrine dose, no-flow and low-flow durations), illness severity (SAPS II, CAHP score), and rates of coronary revascularization were generally similar between groups. Median time from randomization to rewarming initiation was about 4.5–5 hours, the time from rewarming onset to 37 °C was approximately 16.5 hours in the 0.25 °C/h group and 8.8 hours in the 0.50 °C/h group, confirming clear separation of exposure to the two rewarming rates.\n\nThe primary outcome analysis showed no significant difference in IL-6 exposure between groups: median IL-6 AUC (24–48 h) was 12,389 pg/mL·h (IQR 7,256–37,200) in the 0.25 °C/h group versus 8,859 pg/mL·h (IQR 6,825–18,088) in the 0.50 °C/h group (P=0.55). One patient who died between 32 and 40 hours post-H0 was excluded from this AUC analysis due to missing late IL-6 values. IL-6 time courses across all measured points likewise did not demonstrate a favorable pattern with slower rewarming.\n\nSecondary biomarker analyses did not reveal consistent differences between rewarming strategies. Aside from a difference in IL-2 at a single time point (H40), which may represent a chance finding in exploratory analyses without multiplicity adjustment, levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, GM-CSF, TNF-α, CRP, and procalcitonin did not differ significantly between groups. Median NF-L at 48 hours was 76.0 pg/mL (IQR 25.5–3,074.0) in the 0.25 °C/h arm versus 192 pg/mL (IQR 33.6–4,199.0) in the 0.50 °C/h arm (P=0.43). NSE levels at 48 and 72 hours were also similar between groups.\n\nClinical outcomes were likewise comparable. At 90 days, 13 of 25 patients (52.0%) in each group had a favorable CPC score (1 or 2), with identical point estimates and overlapping confidence intervals. ICU mortality and hospital mortality did not differ significantly; the hazard ratio for ICU death for 0.25 °C/h versus 0.50 °C/h was 1.43 (95% CI 0.62–3.32; P=0.41), and a similar estimate was found for in-hospital mortality. ICU and hospital lengths of stay and durations of mechanical ventilation showed no meaningful differences. Exploratory analyses of metabolic disturbances, arrhythmias, and cardiovascular SOFA score trajectories also did not demonstrate clear separation between the rewarming strategies.\n\nThe authors discuss that while TTM is widely used to mitigate postcardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS), the optimal rewarming parameters remain uncertain, and existing observational studies on rewarming rate have yielded conflicting results. IL-6 was chosen as a surrogate marker of systemic inflammation and PCAS severity because it rises early after cardiac arrest, is associated with worse outcomes in prior studies, and has a short half-life that permits detection of rapid changes. However, in this trial, modifying the rewarming rate within the commonly used range (0.25–0.50 °C/h) did not appear to alter IL-6 dynamics, neuronal injury biomarkers, or neurological outcomes at 90 days.\n\nThe authors note limitations, including the single-center design, the focus on OHCA with shockable rhythms (potentially limiting generalizability to non-shockable arrests), and the use of a surrogate primary endpoint rather than functional outcome. The trial was deliberately designed as a pilot to inform future, larger RCTs that might use blinded, long-term functional outcomes as primary endpoints. In conclusion, active rewarming from 33 °C at 0.25 °C/h did not provide an inflammatory or clinical advantage over 0.50 °C/h in this population, and additional research is needed to define the optimal TTM and rewarming strategies after cardiac arrest.""}","{""conditions"": [""Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest"", ""Ventricular Fibrillation"", ""Ventricular Tachycardia"", ""Postcardiac Arrest Syndrome"", ""Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy"", ""Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome""], ""keywords"": [""Cardiac Arrest"", ""Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest"", ""Shockable Rhythm"", ""Ventricular Fibrillation"", ""Ventricular Tachycardia"", ""Postcardiac Arrest Syndrome"", ""Targeted Temperature Management"", ""Therapeutic Hypothermia"", ""Rewarming"", ""Rewarming Rate"", ""Hypothermia"", ""Temperature 33 Degrees Celsius"", ""Fever Prevention"", ""Interleukin-6"", ""IL-6"", ""Cytokines"", ""Systemic Inflammation"", ""Neurofilament Light Chain"", ""NF-L"", ""Neuron-Specific Enolase"", ""Cerebral Performance Category"", ""CPC"", ""Neurological Outcome"", ""Mechanical Ventilation"", ""Intensive Care Unit"", ""Outcomes Research"", ""Randomized Controlled Trial"", ""Post-resuscitation Care""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Single-center, two-arm, parallel-group randomized controlled trial comparing two active rewarming rates (0.25 °C/h vs 0.50 °C/h) after targeted temperature management at 33 °C in comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients with shockable rhythm."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""SINGLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Blinded-outcome-assessor design: treating ICU staff could not be blinded to rewarming rate, but the psychologist who assessed day-90 functional outcomes (CPC) was blinded to group assignment."", ""whoMasked"": [""OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 50, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""0.25 °C/h rewarming rate"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Patients with coma after shockable out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treated with targeted temperature management at 33 °C using a closed-loop surface cooling device.

The study was conducted at KGK Science, Inc. (London, Ontario, Canada) between December 2019 and October 2020, following IRB approval and registration (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04195594).\n\nEligible participants were men and women aged 30–55 years with a body mass index (BMI) between 20.0 and 29.9 kg/m² (eutrophic to overweight range), LDL-C between 2.5 and 4.1 mmol/L (above optimal to borderline high), and otherwise healthy based on medical history and laboratory tests. Key exclusions included pregnancy or breastfeeding, menopause or postmenopause, current dieting, diabetes, hypertension or use of antihypertensive medications, recent major cardiovascular events, kidney or liver disease, use of statins or other drugs and supplements affecting blood pressure, weight, or lipid metabolism, and any unstable medical condition that could interfere with study completion or safety.\n\nThe intervention consisted of a VLCKD providing approximately 5% of total energy from carbohydrates, 70% from fat, and 25% from protein. Daily energy needs were estimated using the Harris–Benedict equation and then multiplied by 0.9 to provide 90% of maintenance caloric requirements, promoting moderate energy deficit without explicit calorie restriction. Participants received detailed dietary counseling from a registered dietitian, an e-book, and additional educational materials. They were instructed to avoid sweeteners, most fruits (except berries), starchy vegetables, low-fat dairy, soy, grains, beans, and alcohol, while emphasizing green leafy and cruciferous vegetables, avocado, eggs, meat, seafood, fermented foods, high-fat dairy, and organic/grass-fed fats and oils. Mindful eating and intermittent fasting were encouraged.\n\nStudy assessments occurred at Day 0 (baseline), 28, 56, 70, 84, 112, and 140. At each visit, weight and blood pressure were measured, and fasting blood samples were collected for lipid analyses (total cholesterol [TC], LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides [TG]). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans and BMI measurements were performed at baseline, Day 70, and Day 140 to determine body composition, including total body fat percentage, android and gynoid fat, android/gynoid fat ratio, and muscle mass percentage. At baseline and Day 140, additional blood tests were conducted for fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and free triiodothyronine (T3), along with standard safety labs and electrocardiograms.\n\nCompliance was evaluated using weekly 3-day food records (3DFR) completed via the Libro application and daily home monitoring of blood glucose and ketone levels (KetoMojo). Participants received ongoing nutrition counseling by phone and email based on review of their food records and biochemical markers. Mean dietary intake over 140 days closely matched the intended macronutrient distribution, with reported carbohydrate intake around 5–7% of calories, fat around 69–72%, and protein around 23%. Daily energy intake was reduced by approximately 594 kcal compared to preintervention intake, despite no formal calorie restriction. Mean fasting ketone concentrations increased from 0.52 mmol/L preintervention to 0.81 mmol/L at Day 140, and the glucose ketone index declined from 13.77 to 8.78, indicating a state of nutritional ketosis.\n\nThe primary outcomes were changes in body composition measures from baseline to Day 70 and Day 140: total body fat percentage, android and gynoid fat percentage, android/gynoid fat ratio, and muscle mass percentage, assessed via DEXA. Secondary outcomes included changes from baseline to Day 140 in ESR, CRP, HbA1c, fasting glucose, and T3. Additional exploratory outcomes included changes in body weight, BMI, blood pressure, and detailed lipid parameters over time. Safety was monitored via adverse event (AE) reporting, clinical chemistry, hematology, electrolytes, liver and kidney function tests, heart rate, and ECG.\n\nA total of 40 volunteers were screened and 14 were enrolled; 11 completed the 140-day intervention. Participants were on average 30–53 years of age, 50% female, predominantly of European ethnicity, with no current smokers and occasional alcohol consumption in most participants.\n\nBody composition improved significantly over the study. Total body fat percentage decreased by 2.25% at Day 70 and 4.41% at Day 140 relative to baseline. Both android and gynoid fat percentages declined, resulting in a significant reduction in the android/gynoid fat ratio, a marker linked to metabolic syndrome and cardiometabolic risk. Muscle mass percentage increased by 2.24% at Day 70 and 4.38% at Day 140, indicating that weight loss was largely due to fat mass rather than lean mass loss. Weight loss was evident by Day 28 and remained significant at all subsequent time points. By Day 56 there was a 5.65% reduction in body weight, reaching a 10.65% reduction by Day 140. BMI decreased by 6.2% at Day 70 and 10.6% at Day 140, with mean BMI shifting from overweight (26.27 kg/m²) at baseline to within the normal range (23.31 kg/m²) by Day 140.\n\nLipid parameters changed in a complex manner. Total cholesterol increased significantly at all postbaseline visits, and LDL-C increased significantly at all time points, although values remained within the acceptable lab range for this population and increases were judged not clinically relevant within the context of the study. HDL-C increased by 12.8% at Day 140, a change considered clinically meaningful due to its association with reduced cardiovascular risk. Triglycerides and the TG/HDL-C ratio did not change significantly. The TC/HDL-C ratio was transiently elevated at intermediate visits but was not significantly different from baseline at Day 140. Exploratory analysis suggested that at Day 140 all participants displayed a lipid profile consistent with a nonatherogenic LDL phenotype A, driven primarily by high HDL-C and low TG/HDL-C ratios, although LDL subclass measurements were not directly obtained.\n\nSystolic blood pressure decreased by about 5.3% (6.52 mmHg) from baseline to Day 140, a magnitude associated in the literature with reduced cardiovascular disease risk. Diastolic blood pressure showed a transient increase at Day 28 but no significant differences at later time points. HbA1c decreased significantly (approximately 4% relative improvement) by Day 140, while fasting glucose, ESR, and CRP did not change significantly. Free T3 levels decreased, which may be related to both the ketogenic diet and weight loss and could influence LDL-C clearance. Dietary cholesterol intake increased by over 300 mg/day during the VLCKD, and may also have contributed to the observed elevations in serum cholesterol.\n\nSafety assessments indicated that the VLCKD was generally well tolerated over 140 days. There were 44 postbaseline adverse events, 13 of which were considered possibly related to the diet. Diet-related adverse events were predominantly gastrointestinal (constipation, diarrhea, heartburn, nausea, vomiting) and all resolved by study end. Clinical chemistry, hematology, electrolyte levels, and liver and kidney function tests remained within normal clinical reference ranges or were considered not clinically significant. No clinically relevant ECG or heart rate changes were observed.\n\nThe study supports that a carefully designed VLCKD can produce substantial weight and fat loss, favorable changes in body fat distribution, improved muscle mass, reductions in HbA1c and systolic blood pressure, and increases in HDL-C in normal-weight to overweight adults with mildly elevated LDL-C. However, total cholesterol and LDL-C levels increased, and the long-term cardiovascular implications of these changes require further investigation, especially with respect to LDL particle size and subclasses. The study was limited by its open-label, single-arm design, small sample size, and short to medium-term duration, which restricts generalizability and causal inference. The authors recommend larger, randomized controlled trials with longer follow-up, assessment of LDL particle characteristics, gut microbiota, and micronutrient status, and evaluation of transition strategies from VLCKD to long-term maintenance diets in populations at higher cardiovascular risk.""}","{""conditions"": [""Overweight"", ""Body Weight"", ""Dyslipidemias"", ""Hyperlipidemias"", ""Hypercholesterolemia"", ""Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol"", ""Cardiometabolic Diseases"", ""Cardiovascular Diseases"", ""Metabolic Syndrome"", ""Blood Pressure"", ""Hypertension"", ""Glycated Hemoglobin A"", ""Glucose Metabolism Disorders"", ""Inflammation"", ""Thyroid Hormones""], ""keywords"": [""Ketogenic Diet"", ""Very Low-Carbohydrate Diet"", ""Nic's Ketogenic Diet"", ""Low-Carbohydrate Diet"", ""Weight Loss"", ""Body Composition"", ""Body Fat Distribution"", ""Android Fat"", ""Gynoid Fat"", ""Android/Gynoid Fat Ratio"", ""Muscle Mass"", ""Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol"", ""High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol"", ""Total Cholesterol"", ""Triglycerides"", ""Lipid Profile"", ""Cardiometabolic Risk"", ""Cardiovascular Risk Factors"", ""Systolic Blood Pressure"", ""Diastolic Blood Pressure"", ""Glycated Hemoglobin"", ""HbA1c"", ""Fasting Glucose"", ""C-Reactive Protein"", ""Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate"", ""Free Triiodothyronine"", ""T3"", ""Nutritional Ketosis"", ""Ketone Bodies"", ""Very Low-Carbohydrate Ketogenic Diet"", ""VLCKD"", ""Dietary Fats"", ""Monounsaturated Fatty Acids"", ""Saturated Fatty Acids"", ""Caloric Restriction"", ""Satiety"", ""Open-Label Pilot Study"", ""Adult"", ""Eutrophic"", ""Overweight Adults""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""NON_RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""SINGLE_GROUP"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Open-label single-arm pilot study in which all enrolled participants followed a very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (Nic's Ketogenic Diet) for 140 days."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Open-label study with no blinding of participants or investigators."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 14, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Very-Low-Carbohydrate Ketogenic Diet (Nic's Ketogenic Diet)"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""Single-arm, open-label pilot study in which all enrolled participants followed a very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet, known as Nic's Ketogenic Diet, for 140 days.

The study tested whether selectively ablating ectopy‑triggering intrinsic cardiac ganglionated plexuses (GPs) using high‑frequency stimulation mapping, without performing standard pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), could better prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation and other atrial arrhythmias than conventional PVI. Patients were randomized to GP ablation alone or PVI and followed for 12 months with regular Holter monitoring. The primary outcome was any documented atrial arrhythmia of at least 30 seconds after a 90‑day blanking period. The study found that GP ablation did not reduce atrial arrhythmia recurrence more than PVI, although it used less radiofrequency energy and was associated with a greater reduction in antiarrhythmic drug use."", ""detailedDescription"": ""GANGLIA-AF (NCT02487654) was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, single‑blinded clinical trial conducted at three UK centers in patients with symptomatic, drug‑refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) who were clinically indicated for catheter ablation. The trial investigated the role of the intrinsic cardiac autonomic nervous system—specifically ganglionated plexuses (GPs)—as upstream triggers of AF and evaluated whether selective GP ablation (GPA) could perform as well as or better than standard pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) without requiring concomitant PVI.\n\nPatients were randomized to either:\n1) Selective GP ablation without PVI, or\n2) Conventional wide antral PVI.\n\nRandomization used a permuted block \""sealed envelope\"" approach, initially 2:1 (favoring GPA) and subsequently 1:1, and patients and their usual‑care cardiologists were blinded to treatment allocation. Ablation operators and outcome assessors were unblinded.\n\nIn the GPA arm, high‑frequency stimulation (HFS) was applied endocardially across the left atrium to functionally map GPs. Two functional classes of GPs were targeted:\n- Ectopy‑triggering GPs (ET‑GPs), identified using synchronized HFS delivered within the local atrial refractory period during sinus rhythm to avoid myocardial capture and selectively stimulate autonomic fibers. A positive ET‑GP response was defined as reproducible induction of pulmonary vein or atrial ectopy, atrial fibrillation, or atrial tachycardia.\n- Atrioventricular dissociating GPs (AVD‑GPs), identified using continuous HFS during AF, defined by a ≥50% increase in the R‑R interval compared with baseline.\n\nThe primary mapping focus was on ET‑GPs, but if synchronized HFS resulted in sustained or incessant AF that could not be terminated despite ET‑GP ablation, continuous HFS was used to identify AVD‑GPs, which were then ablated as well to facilitate restoration of sinus rhythm. Ablation consisted of clusters of point‑by‑point radiofrequency lesions around each GP site, with repeat HFS to confirm functional elimination. No intentional PVI was performed in the GPA arm, and pulmonary veins remained electrically connected unless affected by proximity of GP lesions.\n\nIn the PVI arm, standard wide antral circumferential radiofrequency ablation was performed around the pulmonary veins, with confirmation of durable entry and exit block. In more than 60% of PVI cases, an ablation index was used to guide lesion delivery.\n\nAll patients underwent general anesthesia, transseptal access, heparinization, and left atrial electroanatomic mapping. Antiarrhythmic drugs and beta‑blockers were stopped before the procedure, and amiodarone was discontinued at least two months prior. After ablation, patients were followed over 12 months with continuous clinical contact and 48‑hour Holter monitoring at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Additional Holters or device interrogations (pacemaker, loop recorder, or personal ECG devices) were performed if symptoms occurred.\n\nThe primary endpoint was any documented atrial arrhythmia episode (AF, atrial tachycardia, or atrial flutter) lasting at least 30 seconds, recorded by Holter, surface ECG, or implanted/personal monitoring devices, occurring after a 90‑day post‑ablation blanking period. Secondary endpoints included the need for repeat AF ablation, procedural complications (e.g., tamponade, pericarditis, bleeding, thrombosis, phrenic nerve palsy), and mortality. Patients were encouraged, but not mandated, to discontinue antiarrhythmic drugs after the blanking period if asymptomatic.\n\nA total of 116 patients were randomized; after exclusions due to protocol violations and withdrawals, 102 patients (52 GPA, 50 PVI) were analyzed per protocol. The population had a mean age of approximately 63 years and was predominantly male. Baseline differences included a higher prevalence of antiarrhythmic drug use in the GPA group and a higher proportion of CHA2DS2‑VASc score of 1 in the PVI group.\n\nProcedurally, GPA required longer total procedure and fluoroscopy times due to extensive HFS mapping but used significantly less radiofrequency ablation time and total energy than PVI. On average, about 89 HFS sites per patient were tested in the GPA group, with roughly 18.5% of sites exhibiting ET‑GP responses.\n\nAt 12‑month follow‑up, freedom from the primary endpoint was 50% (26/52) in the GPA group and 64% (32/50) in the PVI group, with no statistically significant difference between the groups by Kaplan‑Meier analysis. A GPA subgroup that underwent ET‑GP ablation only (without requiring AVD‑GP ablation for incessant AF) showed a numerically higher success rate of 58% freedom from recurrent atrial arrhythmia. The proportions of atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia as the index recurrent rhythm were similar between arms.\n\nThe rate of repeat ablation was comparable between groups (about one‑third in GPA vs one‑quarter in PVI). Notably, GPA was associated with a significantly greater reduction in post‑ablation antiarrhythmic drug usage compared with PVI, despite lower total radiofrequency delivery. There was one case of periprocedural cardiac tamponade in the GPA arm that resolved with pericardiocentesis; there were no major complications in the PVI arm. Pericarditis‑like presentations were more frequent in the GPA group.\n\nHeart rate and heart rate variability analyses suggested modest autonomic changes after ablation. At 12 months, the standard deviation of R‑R intervals was higher in GPA than in PVI, but these autonomic markers did not clearly predict arrhythmia recurrence. Multivariate analysis indicated that in the GPA group, a history of hypertension was associated with better outcomes (reduced AF/AT recurrence), whereas the need for continuous HFS mapping due to incessant AF (requiring AVD‑GP ablation) was associated with higher recurrence. In the PVI group, longer total radiofrequency ablation time was associated with increased recurrence.\n\nIn conclusion, selective GP ablation guided by functional HFS mapping did not outperform conventional PVI in preventing recurrent atrial arrhythmias in patients with paroxysmal AF and required longer procedure times. However, GPA achieved similar arrhythmia control with significantly less radiofrequency ablation and greater reduction in antiarrhythmic drug use. Patients with hypertension appeared to derive particular benefit from GPA. The findings support the concept that intrinsic cardiac autonomic structures contribute to AF pathophysiology but indicate that, in its current form, GPA is not a complete replacement for PVI. Further refinement of mapping technology and strategies to maintain sinus rhythm during mapping may improve the efficacy and practicality of GP‑targeted ablation.""}","{""conditions"": [""Atrial Fibrillation"", ""Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation""], ""keywords"": [""Atrial Fibrillation"", ""Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation"", ""Pulmonary Vein Isolation"", ""Ganglionated Plexus"", ""Cardiac Autonomic Nervous System"", ""Catheter Ablation"", ""Radiofrequency Ablation"", ""Atrial Tachycardia"", ""Atrial Flutter"", ""High-Frequency Stimulation"", ""Autonomic Modulation"", ""Hypertension""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": ""P12M"", ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, 2-arm, parallel-group trial comparing ganglionated plexus ablation without pulmonary vein isolation versus pulmonary vein isolation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": ""PROSPECTIVE"", ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""SINGLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Single-blinded design: patients and their usual-care cardiologists were blinded to randomization; operators performing ablation, data collector, and analyst were unblinded."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 102, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Ganglionated Plexus Ablation (GPA)"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Patients with symptomatic drug‑refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation underwent selective endocardial ganglionated plexus ablation without pulmonary vein isolation.

Prior phase II clinical data suggested that copper depletion improves event-free and overall survival in high-risk breast cancer patients, including those with TNBC, without significantly affecting primary tumor growth. Using human and mouse TNBC models, the researchers show that TM selectively targets a small, highly metastatic subpopulation of SOX2/OCT4-positive cells that have elevated intracellular copper and rely heavily on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Copper depletion destabilizes mitochondrial Complex IV, disrupts respiration, activates the AMPK–mTORC1 energy-sensing pathway, and reduces invasion and lung metastasis while sparing overall cell viability and primary tumor growth."", ""detailedDescription"": ""The study explores a mechanistic link between copper metabolism, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and metastatic progression in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Clinically, high expression of the copper transporter CTR1 (SLC31A1) in breast tumors correlates with poorer overall survival, higher stage, and more aggressive subtypes such as TNBC and HER2-positive disease. A previously conducted phase II clinical trial of tetrathiomolybdate (TM), a first-in-class oral copper chelator originally developed for Wilson’s disease, showed that sustained copper depletion was safe, well-tolerated, and associated with unexpectedly high event-free survival in high-risk breast cancer patients, including those with stage 4 TNBC without evidence of disease.\n\nTo understand how copper depletion limits metastasis, the authors use two TNBC models: a human lung-tropic variant of MDA-MB-231 (LM2) and a syngeneic murine model EO771.ML1 (ML1). In these models, TM is administered orally at doses that reduce systemic and intracellular copper to about 30% of baseline levels, mimicking the levels achieved in the clinical trial. At these doses, TM does not significantly affect in vitro cell viability, proliferation, or primary tumor growth in vivo, but it markedly reduces invasion through extracellular matrix in transwell assays and decreases lung metastatic burden after resection of primary tumors.\n\nUsing a SOX2/OCT4-GFP promoter-reporter system, the study identifies a discrete subpopulation of SOX2/OCT4-positive cancer cells within primary TNBC tumors. These cells exhibit stem-like traits, enhanced invasive and metastatic potential, higher basal oxygen consumption, and elevated intracellular copper compared with SOX2/OCT4-negative cells. TM preferentially reduces invasion and respiratory capacity in this GFP-positive subpopulation. Global, multiplexed tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomics in sorted GFP-positive versus GFP-negative cells reveals that TM treatment specifically downregulates multiple subunits of mitochondrial Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) and enriches for gene ontology pathways related to the mitochondrial electron transport chain in the GFP-positive cells.\n\nFunctional assays confirm that TM selectively destabilizes Complex IV protein subunits without altering their mRNA levels, reduces cytochrome c oxidase activity, and perturbs mitochondrial cristae structure, while leaving mitochondrial DNA content and overall mitochondrial mass largely unchanged. Seahorse extracellular flux analyses demonstrate that SOX2/OCT4-positive cells are more OXPHOS-dependent than reporter-negative cells and are more strongly affected by TM, with dramatic reductions in basal and ATP-linked respiration and in the ratio of mitochondrial to glycolytic ATP production. These respiratory defects are reversible upon TM withdrawal or copper repletion and can be reproduced using another copper chelator (trientine) or by CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of the copper transporter CTR1.\n\nTo dissect the specific contribution of mitochondrial copper, the authors knock down the mitochondria-specific copper chaperone COX17, which delivers copper to Complex IV. COX17 knockdown reduces oxygen consumption, ATP-linked respiration, and invasion in vitro and decreases lung metastases in vivo, without global copper depletion. Similarly, knockdown of COX20, a Complex IV assembly factor, reduces oxygen consumption and invasion. These manipulations phenocopy TM’s effects, indicating that Complex IV dysfunction and mitochondrial copper restriction are central to the observed anti-metastatic phenotype.\n\nMetabolomic profiling reveals that TM treatment increases glucose consumption, lactate production, and levels of nucleotide precursors, including AMP, reflecting a shift toward glycolysis and altered nucleotide metabolism. TM markedly reduces mitochondrial ATP production while sparing glycolytic ATP production. The resulting rise in AMP and energy stress leads to activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), evidenced by increased phosphorylation of AMPK (Thr172) and its downstream target acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC, Ser79). COX17 knockdown similarly reduces mitochondrial ATP and activates AMPK.\n\nDownstream, AMPK activation suppresses mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, as shown by increased phosphorylation of raptor (Ser792) and reduced phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate p70S6K (Thr389); 4E-BP1 phosphorylation is also modulated. Pharmacologic activation of AMPK with AICAR or A-769662 independently reduces invasion, whereas siRNA-mediated AMPK knockdown rescues the TM-induced loss of invasion. These findings position AMPK activation as a key mediator of the anti-invasive effect of copper depletion.\n\nThe study also acknowledges other copper-dependent processes relevant to metastasis, such as lysyl oxidase and LOXL2-mediated extracellular matrix remodeling and pre-metastatic niche formation, which had been previously linked to TM in TNBC models and patients. Nevertheless, the present work provides direct evidence that a copper–metabolism–metastasis axis operates through mitochondrial Complex IV, OXPHOS dependence of SOX2/OCT4-positive metastatic cells, and AMPK–mTORC1 signaling.\n\nOverall, this research connects clinical observations of improved outcomes with TM in high-risk breast cancer to mechanistic data in TNBC models. It suggests that copper chelation at physiologically tolerable levels selectively targets an OXPHOS-dependent, copper-enriched metastatic subpopulation within TNBC, disrupts mitochondrial respiration, activates AMPK, suppresses mTORC1, and impairs invasion and lung metastasis. These insights could inform biomarker-based patient selection (e.g., CTR1 expression, OXPHOS reliance, SOX2/OCT4-positive populations) and rational design of future randomized phase II trials of copper depletion therapy in TNBC and other aggressive breast cancer subtypes.""}","{""conditions"": [""Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms"", ""Breast Neoplasms"", ""Neoplasm Metastasis""], ""keywords"": [""Triple-negative breast cancer"", ""TNBC"", ""Breast cancer"", ""Metastasis"", ""Lung metastasis"", ""Copper"", ""Copper chelators"", ""Tetrathiomolybdate"", ""TM"", ""Trientine"", ""Copper transporter 1"", ""CTR1"", ""SLC31A1"", ""Cytochrome c oxidase"", ""Complex IV"", ""Mitochondrial respiration"", ""Oxidative phosphorylation"", ""OXPHOS"", ""Mitochondrial electron transport chain"", ""SOX2"", ""OCT4"", ""Cancer stem cells"", ""AMP-activated protein kinase"", ""AMPK"", ""mTORC1"", ""P70S6K"", ""COX17"", ""COX20"", ""Lysyl oxidase"", ""LOXL2"", ""Invasion"", ""Pre-metastatic niche""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""NA"", ""interventionModel"": ""SINGLE_GROUP"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Single-arm phase II trial of oral tetrathiomolybdate (TM) in high-risk breast cancer patients who were stage 4 with no evidence of disease (NED), with long-term follow-up for event-free and overall survival."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": ""OTHER"", ""timePerspective"": ""OTHER"", ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""No blinding or masking was described; TM was administered openly as a copper-chelating treatment."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 75, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Tetrathiomolybdate"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Breast cancer patients at high risk for relapse (including stage 4 no evidence of disease) received oral copper chelation therapy with tetrathiomolybdate (TM).

The study found that most local and systemic reactions were mild to moderate and transient, severe adverse events were uncommon, and no serious adverse events occurred. One month after the second dose, robust SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses were observed in both younger (20–64 years) and older (65–85 years) adults, although titers were somewhat lower in older participants."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind phase 1/2 study (NCT04588480) was conducted at two sites in Japan to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in healthy Japanese adults aged 20–85 years, including those with stable preexisting disease. BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine encoding the prefusion-stabilized full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Participants with prior COVID-19, significant immunocompromise, certain viral infections (HBV, HCV, HIV), severe vaccine-related allergy, or prior coronavirus vaccination were excluded.\n\nA total of 160 Japanese participants were randomized 3:1 to receive two intramuscular injections of 30 µg BNT162b2 (n=119) or saline placebo (n=41) administered 21 days apart. Participants were stratified by age: 20–64 years (n=130) and 65–85 years (n=30). More than 97% of BNT162b2 recipients received both doses. Safety assessments included solicited local reactions and systemic events within 7 days after each dose (collected via electronic diary), unsolicited adverse events (AEs) from dose 1 through 1 month after dose 2, serious adverse events (SAEs) through 1 month after dose 2 in this interim report, and hematology/chemistry laboratory parameters in the first 24 participants.\n\nThe most common local reaction after BNT162b2 was injection site pain, predominantly mild to moderate, with a median duration of 1–3.5 days; four vaccine recipients reported severe injection site pain. Placebo recipients reported only mild injection site pain in one case. Frequent systemic events included fatigue, headache, and chills, generally mild to moderate, transient (median 1–2 days), and more common in the younger age group. Severe systemic events were uncommon. After dose 1, one participant (25-year-old woman) reported severe headache, chills, fatigue, and joint pain, all considered vaccine-related; these resolved within 1–6 days, and she did not receive dose 2. After dose 2, small proportions of vaccine recipients reported severe fatigue, headache, chills, or joint pain. No grade 4 local or systemic events were observed. Fever >40 °C did not occur, and only one participant had fever >38.9 °C. Analgesic/antipyretic use was more frequent in vaccine than placebo recipients.\n\nFrom dose 1 through 1 month after dose 2, any AEs were reported by 10.1% of BNT162b2 and 7.3% of placebo recipients. Common AEs (in more than one participant) were nasopharyngitis and headache. There were no immediate AEs within 30 minutes of vaccination, no SAEs, no life-threatening AEs, no deaths, no reported lymphadenopathy, and no COVID-19 diagnoses in this period. Two AEs were assessed as related to BNT162b2: the cluster of severe reactogenicity symptoms in the 25-year-old woman (leading to discontinuation of vaccination) and a case of moderate erythema multiforme in a 74-year-old woman that appeared two days after dose 2, confirmed by skin biopsy and resolving in 27 days with topical and oral therapy. In the 24-participant laboratory subset, transient mild lymphopenia occurred in some BNT162b2 recipients after dose 1 and resolved within a week; no laboratory abnormalities were reported as AEs.\n\nImmunogenicity was evaluated using a SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralization assay employing an mNeonGreen reporter virus based on the USA_WA1/2020 strain. Sera were collected before doses 1 and 2 and at multiple time points up to 1 month after dose 2. In both age strata, neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs) rose substantially by 7 days post–dose 2 and remained elevated at 1 month. One month after dose 2, 50% neutralization GMTs were 571 in the 20–64-year group and 366 in the 65–85-year group, corresponding to geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) from baseline of 55.8 and 36.6, respectively. As seen in global trials, older adults showed lower GMTs than younger adults, but responses remained robust. Neutralization GMTs at 7 days after dose 2 in this Japanese cohort were comparable to those in the global trial (18–55 and 65–85 years).\n\nThe study was descriptive and not powered for formal hypothesis testing or efficacy evaluation. Efficacy endpoints against clinical COVID-19 were not assessed; however, cases of COVID-19, if any, are being collected for analysis after study completion. Longer-term immunogenicity at 6 and 12 months is planned but not yet available in this interim report. Overall, the findings show that two doses of 30 µg BNT162b2 given 21 days apart have an acceptable safety profile and induce strong neutralizing antibody responses in healthy Japanese adults, supporting the use of BNT162b2 for prevention of COVID-19 in this population.""}","{""conditions"": [""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2 infection""], ""keywords"": [""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""Coronavirus Infections"", ""BNT162b2"", ""mRNA vaccine"", ""Vaccines, mRNA"", ""Neutralizing Antibodies"", ""Immunogenicity"", ""Vaccine Safety"", ""Japan"", ""Adults"", ""Aged""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE1"", ""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Participants were randomized 3:1 to receive two intramuscular injections of 30 µg BNT162b2 or placebo (saline) 21 days apart in a parallel-group design."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""PREVENTION"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""TRIPLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Observer-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in which participants, investigators, and other study staff were blinded; only staff who dispensed/administered study medication were unblinded."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT"", ""CARE_PROVIDER"", ""INVESTIGATOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 160, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""BNT162b2"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Participants were randomized 3:1 to receive 2 intramuscular injections of 30 μg BNT162b2 administered 21 days apart.

Participants aged 40–85 years with COPD and chronic productive cough or recent COPD exacerbation were assigned to chlorhexidine or placebo mouth rinse. The main hypothesis was that chlorhexidine would reduce microbiota biomass in the mouth and lungs and thereby improve COPD-related symptoms and health-related quality of life. The primary outcome was change in oral and sputum microbiota biomass (by 16S rRNA quantification); secondary outcomes included microbial diversity and taxonomy, systemic inflammatory markers, daily symptom scores, and St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) scores."", ""detailedDescription"": ""The ChLorhexidine effect In the oral and lung MicroBiota (CLIMB) study is a single-centre, randomized, blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group preliminary clinical trial conducted at a tertiary-care Veterans Affairs medical centre in the USA. The trial investigated the impact of altering the oral microbiome using chlorhexidine mouth rinses on oral and lung microbiota and clinical outcomes in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nEligible participants were 40–85 years old with a confirmed diagnosis of COPD and either chronic productive cough or at least one COPD exacerbation in the preceding year. Key exclusion criteria included antibiotics within the previous 2 months, less than four teeth, and not being at least 30 days recovered from a COPD exacerbation. Forty-four participants were randomized 1:1 via a random number generator to receive either 15 mL of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse (PerioGard) or a matched placebo mouth rinse, used twice daily for 8 weeks. The pharmacist handled allocation and was the only unblinded staff member.\n\nAt baseline (visit 1), participants underwent medical history, spirometry, and completion of the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). They were instructed to complete daily diaries using the Breathlessness, Cough and Sputum Scale (BCSS). Blood, oral rinse, and induced sputum samples were collected prior to randomization. After 8 weeks of treatment, participants returned study diaries, repeated the SGRQ, and provided follow-up blood, oral, and sputum samples.\n\nThe primary outcome was the change in oral and sputum microbiota biomass from baseline to 8 weeks, comparing chlorhexidine versus placebo, measured by 16S rRNA copy number with normalization to sample mass. Although the primary endpoint was biomass, power calculations were based on expected changes in alpha diversity (a secondary outcome) due to available data at study initiation. Secondary outcomes included: (1) oral and sputum microbiota alpha diversity (Shannon and Simpson indices) and taxonomic composition; (2) systemic inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, white blood cell count); (3) daily respiratory symptoms assessed by BCSS; (4) health-related quality of life assessed by SGRQ; and (5) safety and adverse events. Subgroup analyses excluded participants who received systemic antibiotics during the study.\n\nMicrobiological assessments used frozen oral rinse and sputum samples for DNA extraction, quantitative 16S rRNA PCR, and 16S rRNA V4 region sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Because the methods measure total bacterial DNA, they cannot distinguish between live and dead bacteria. Statistical analyses included two-sample t tests for log10-transformed biomass changes, linear regression for changes in diversity indices and clinical outcomes (adjusting for baseline values), multiple imputation for missing sputum weights, and correction for multiple testing via the step-down Bonferroni method. Analyses were conducted according to a modified intention-to-treat principle.\n\nForty participants (20 per group) completed the 8-week trial; all four withdrawals were in the chlorhexidine arm. Participants were predominantly male and Caucasian, with severe airflow limitation (mean FEV1 % predicted ~42%) and an average of about two COPD exacerbations in the prior year. Baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between treatment groups.\n\nChlorhexidine did not significantly reduce oral or sputum microbiota biomass relative to placebo. Both groups had modest decreases in biomass over time, and between-group differences in log10 change were not statistically significant. In sputum, some analyses even suggested a non-significant trend toward higher biomass in the chlorhexidine group, though this was contrary to the a priori hypothesis and interpreted cautiously.\n\nIn contrast, chlorhexidine use was associated with a significant decrease in alpha diversity in both oral and sputum microbiota. Regression analyses adjusted for baseline values showed that chlorhexidine significantly reduced Shannon and Simpson diversity indices compared with placebo for both sample types, findings that persisted in participants who did not receive antibiotics during the study. Exploratory taxonomic analyses revealed chlorhexidine-associated reductions in Corynebacterium abundance in sputum and Lachnoanaerobaculum in oral samples, but no broad genus-level shifts were detected, likely reflecting the method’s inability to distinguish live from dead microbes.\n\nClinically, chlorhexidine did not significantly improve daily BCSS symptom scores or systemic inflammatory markers (CRP, fibrinogen, white blood cell count) relative to placebo over the 8-week period. However, chlorhexidine users experienced a statistically and clinically meaningful improvement in respiratory health-related quality of life as reflected by a greater decrease in SGRQ total score (approximately −4.7 points vs +1.7 points with placebo, between-group difference about −6.2 points). No single SGRQ domain (symptoms, activity, impacts) fully explained this effect, suggesting a broad quality-of-life benefit. Adverse events were few and consistent with the known mild tolerability profile of chlorhexidine oral rinses (for example, mild oral discomfort, transient taste changes, tooth discoloration).\n\nThe study concludes that while twice-daily chlorhexidine oral rinses did not significantly lower microbiota biomass in the mouth or lungs as measured by total bacterial DNA, they did reduce microbiota alpha diversity in both sites and improved COPD-related quality of life. The authors propose that chlorhexidine may reduce the burden or alter the composition of viable oral bacteria, thereby modifying the lung microbiota and local inflammation through microaspiration, effects not fully captured by total DNA-based biomass measures. The trial’s limitations include its small sample size, single-centre design, predominantly male and racially homogeneous population, use of DNA-based methods that cannot differentiate live from dead bacteria, incomplete sputum weight data, and short follow-up. The findings support further, larger-scale trials to clarify the mechanisms linking oral antiseptic use, microbial ecology, and clinical outcomes in COPD, and to determine whether the observed quality-of-life benefits are durable and clinically generalizable.""}","{""conditions"": [""Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive"", ""Chronic Bronchitis"", ""Chronic Cough"", ""Sputum Production"", ""Lung Diseases"", ""Oral Microbiome"", ""Lung Microbiome"", ""Respiratory Tract Infections""], ""keywords"": [""Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease"", ""COPD"", ""Chronic bronchitis"", ""Chronic cough"", ""Sputum production"", ""Lung microbiota"", ""Oral microbiota"", ""Microbiome"", ""Chlorhexidine"", ""Mouthwashes"", ""Antiseptics"", ""St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire"", ""Breathlessness Cough and Sputum Scale"", ""C-reactive protein"", ""Fibrinogen"", ""Leukocytes"", ""Bacterial biomass"", ""Alpha diversity"", ""Shannon index"", ""Simpson index"", ""16S rRNA sequencing"", ""Veterans"", ""Quality of life"", ""Respiratory health-related quality of life""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Randomised, blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group preliminary study comparing twice-daily 0.12% chlorhexidine oral rinses versus matched placebo mouth rinses for 8 weeks."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Placebo-controlled and blinded; participants and all study staff except the pharmacist who handled allocation and assignment were blinded to treatment group."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT"", ""CARE_PROVIDER"", ""INVESTIGATOR"", ""OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 44, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Chlorhexidine oral rinse"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Participants with COPD were randomized to receive 15 mL of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse (PerioGard) twice daily for 8 weeks.

Both newly enrolled patients and those rolling over from prior Phase 3 fevipiprant efficacy trials (LUSTER-1, LUSTER-2, ZEAL-1, ZEAL-2) were included. Primary outcomes focused on treatment‑emergent adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation. Exploratory analyses assessed asthma exacerbation rates and lung function (FEV1). Fevipiprant showed a long‑term safety profile similar to placebo, with exploratory signals of reduced moderate‑to‑severe exacerbations and modest FEV1 improvement, although these efficacy findings were not powered or multiplicity‑adjusted and should be interpreted cautiously."", ""detailedDescription"": ""SPIRIT (NCT03052517) was a Phase 3, randomised, placebo‑controlled, parallel‑group, multicentre study designed primarily to characterise the long‑term safety of fevipiprant, a highly selective, reversible antagonist of the prostaglandin D2 receptor 2 (DP2/CRTH2), in patients with uncontrolled asthma. The DP2 pathway is implicated in type 2 airway inflammation and mediates chemoattraction and activation of eosinophils, basophils, group 2 innate lymphoid cells, and Th2 lymphocytes via prostaglandin D2 and its metabolites.\n\nThe trial enrolled male and female patients aged ≥12 years with moderate‑to‑severe asthma treated according to Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) steps 3, 4, or 5. Two main cohorts were included: (1) rollover patients who had completed one of four Phase 3 fevipiprant efficacy trials (LUSTER‑1, LUSTER‑2 in severe asthma, and ZEAL‑1, ZEAL‑2 in moderate asthma) while still on blinded study therapy, and (2) newly recruited patients with inadequately controlled asthma (ACQ ≥1.5) on GINA step 4–5 treatment for at least 3 months and reduced lung function (percent predicted FEV1 ≤85% for adults, ≤90% for adolescents). Patients with recent severe exacerbations, recent respiratory tract infection, or asthma worsening prior to first visit were excluded. Rollover patients with serious or drug‑related AEs in their prior fevipiprant study were not eligible.\n\nSPIRIT consisted of two consecutive treatment periods: an initial 52‑week double‑blind period followed by an optional 104‑week single‑blind extension. Patients were randomised using stratified block randomisation in an approximate 3:3:1 ratio to receive fevipiprant 150 mg once daily, fevipiprant 450 mg once daily, or matching placebo, in addition to standard of care (SoC) asthma treatment. Rollover patients were re‑randomised and could receive a different treatment from their prior trial. Randomisation strata accounted for prior treatment and study (LUSTER or ZEAL) and for newly enrolled patients. An independent data monitoring committee oversaw patient safety.\n\nThe primary objective was to evaluate the long‑term safety and tolerability of fevipiprant 150 mg and 450 mg versus placebo. Key safety endpoints were time‑to‑first treatment‑emergent adverse event (AE), time‑to‑first treatment‑emergent serious adverse event (SAE), and time‑to‑first AE leading to discontinuation of study treatment. Treatment‑emergent AEs were defined as events starting on or after the first dose and up to the day after the last dose. A Cox regression model stratified by randomisation stratum, with treatment, asthma severity (GINA steps 3–5), and region as fixed factors, was used to estimate hazard ratios comparing fevipiprant doses with placebo. AEs were coded using MedDRA v22.1, and exposure‑adjusted incidence rates were calculated. Additional safety assessments included laboratory parameters, vital signs, ECGs, and adverse events of special interest (cardiac events, hepatotoxicity, idiosyncratic drug reactions, tachycardia).\n\nExploratory efficacy analyses focused on the rate of moderate‑to‑severe asthma exacerbations and change from baseline in pre‑dose FEV1. A severe exacerbation was defined as use of rescue systemic corticosteroids for ≥3 days with hospitalisation or prolonged emergency department stay (>24 h), or asthma‑related death. A moderate exacerbation was defined as rescue systemic corticosteroids for ≥3 days without prolonged hospital care. Due to negative lung function outcomes in ZEAL and the expectation of few exacerbations in moderate asthma, ZEAL rollover patients were excluded from the SPIRIT exploratory efficacy analyses; only LUSTER rollover and newly randomised patients were included. Exacerbation rates were analysed using negative binomial regression including treatment, randomisation stratum, asthma severity, region, prior 12‑month exacerbation history, and, for the overall population, blood eosinophil category (≥250 vs <250 cells/µL). Change in pre‑dose FEV1 was analysed using a mixed model for repeated measures with baseline FEV1, visit, and treatment‑by‑visit interactions, and the same covariates; an unstructured covariance matrix was used. Subgroup analyses were pre‑specified for patients with high blood eosinophil counts (≥250 cells/µL).\n\nThe study enrolled 2,538 patients (1,807 rollover and 731 new): 1,093 were randomised to fevipiprant 150 mg, 1,085 to fevipiprant 450 mg, and 360 to placebo. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were balanced across groups, with a mean age of about 50 years, mean asthma duration about 21 years, and 60% atopic. Most patients were never‑smokers, and mean pre‑bronchodilator percent predicted FEV1 was approximately 61%, with mean bronchodilator reversibility around 23%.\n\nSPIRIT was terminated early by the sponsor on 16 December 2019 after the wider fevipiprant Phase 3 programme failed to demonstrate sufficient efficacy. Consequently, data from the 52‑week double‑blind and optional 104‑week single‑blind periods were combined for analysis rather than analysed separately as initially planned. At termination, 1,184 patients had received at least 52 weeks of treatment, and 163 had at least 104 weeks of exposure.\n\nSafety analyses showed that both fevipiprant doses had a safety profile generally similar to placebo. Hazard ratios for time‑to‑first treatment‑emergent AE and SAE were <1 for both fevipiprant doses versus placebo, indicating no excess risk; however, hazard ratios for AEs leading to discontinuation were slightly >1, with small event numbers and wide confidence intervals. The most common AEs were asthma exacerbation, nasopharyngitis, and bronchitis, mostly mild or moderate. Exposure‑adjusted incidence rates of SAEs and discontinuations due to AEs were low and comparable across groups. Five treatment‑emergent deaths occurred (three in the 150 mg group, one in the 450 mg group, one in placebo), none judged related to study drug and none due to asthma exacerbation. There was no evidence of dose‑related safety signals or differential safety by age, sex, or prior study cohort. Adverse events of special interest occurred infrequently and without notable imbalances. Laboratory values, vital signs, and ECG findings were similar across treatment arms.\n\nExploratory efficacy results indicated lower annualized rates of moderate‑to‑severe asthma exacerbations and longer time‑to‑first exacerbation for both fevipiprant doses compared with placebo in the overall efficacy population and in the high eosinophil subgroup. Rate ratios versus placebo for exacerbations were approximately 0.55–0.58 overall and 0.61–0.64 in patients with eosinophils ≥250 cells/µL, with no clear difference between doses. These reductions were mainly driven by rollover patients from the LUSTER trials; newly enrolled patients did not show a consistent benefit. Fevipiprant also produced modest improvements in pre‑dose FEV1 at Week 52 versus placebo, more noticeable in the high eosinophil subgroup. Nonetheless, these efficacy analyses were post hoc or exploratory, performed without multiplicity adjustment, and the overall fevipiprant programme (notably LUSTER and ZEAL) did not confirm clinically meaningful efficacy.\n\nIn conclusion, SPIRIT demonstrates that long‑term administration of fevipiprant 150 mg or 450 mg once daily, added to standard asthma therapy, is generally well tolerated over up to 104 weeks in a large population of patients with uncontrolled moderate‑to‑severe asthma. While exploratory analyses suggested reductions in moderate‑to‑severe exacerbations and modest lung function improvements, the lack of confirmatory efficacy in the broader Phase 3 programme led to discontinuation of fevipiprant development. The long‑term safety data from SPIRIT are expected to inform future development of DP2 receptor antagonists for asthma."", ""conditionsModule"": {""conditions"": [""Asthma"", ""Moderate to Severe Asthma""], ""keywords"": [""Asthma"", ""Uncontrolled Asthma"", ""Moderate Asthma"", ""Severe Asthma"", ""Prostaglandin D2 receptor 2"", ""DP2 receptor"", ""CRTH2 receptor"", ""Fevipiprant"", ""Asthma Exacerbation"", ""Eosinophils"", ""Type 2 inflammation"", ""Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second"", ""FEV1"", ""Inhaled Corticosteroids"", ""Long-term Safety""]}}","{""conditions"": [""Asthma"", ""Moderate to Severe Asthma""], ""keywords"": [""Asthma"", ""Uncontrolled Asthma"", ""Moderate Asthma"", ""Severe Asthma"", ""Prostaglandin D2 receptor 2"", ""DP2 receptor"", ""CRTH2 receptor"", ""Fevipiprant"", ""Asthma Exacerbation"", ""Eosinophils"", ""Type 2 inflammation"", ""Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second"", ""FEV1"", ""Inhaled Corticosteroids"", ""Long-term Safety""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE3""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Two-treatment-period multicentre, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial: a 52-week double-blind period followed by an optional 104-week single-blind period, with patients randomized approximately 3:3:1 to fevipiprant 150 mg, fevipiprant 450 mg, or placebo once daily."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Period 1 was double-blind; Period 2 was single-blind.

Patients were randomized to receive ADX plus NIVO or NIVO alone. The main goal was to compare tumor shrinkage rates between the two groups, with additional assessment of survival, disease progression, safety, and multiple tissue and blood biomarkers (including PD-L1, TMB, HER2, TGF-β signatures, and others) that might predict benefit from immunotherapy."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This was a phase 2, open-label, randomized, multicenter study (NCT02864381; GS-US-296-2013) conducted at 34 sites in the USA, Europe, and Australia. The study population consisted of adults (≥18 years) with histologically confirmed, inoperable locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who had experienced disease progression after at least one prior systemic therapy/line of treatment for unresectable or metastatic disease. Key eligibility criteria included measurable disease by RECIST v1.1, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0–1, adequate organ function, availability of archival tumor tissue for biomarker analyses, and tumor sites accessible for repeat biopsies.\n\nPatients were randomized 1:1 via a centralized, interactive web response system to receive either nivolumab (NIVO) monotherapy or the combination of andecaliximab (ADX) plus nivolumab. Randomization was stratified by tumor PD-L1 status, defined as tumor cell (TC) membrane PD-L1 expression ≥1% versus <1% by a central laboratory assay (28-8 pharmDx). In the NIVO-alone arm, patients received nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously over approximately 60 minutes on day 1 and every 2 weeks thereafter. In the combination arm, patients received ADX 800 mg intravenously over approximately 30 minutes on day 1 and every 2 weeks, followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously over approximately 60 minutes on the same schedule. Treatment continued for up to 2 years or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.\n\nThe primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) by investigator assessment using RECIST v1.1, defined as the proportion of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) prior to initiation of any new anticancer therapy. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response, and the incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and laboratory abnormalities. Imaging (contrast-enhanced CT or MRI) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed at baseline and every 8 weeks to assess tumor burden. Safety follow-up was conducted 30 days after the last dose of ADX and 5 months after the last dose of NIVO, with survival follow-up approximately every 3 months for up to 5 years.\n\nExtensive exploratory biomarker analyses were incorporated to understand predictors of response and resistance to immunotherapy and the biological impact of MMP9 inhibition. Archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue was used for central PD-L1 testing and additional biomarkers. On-treatment tumor biopsies were obtained between weeks 5 and 9. Biomarkers included PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and tumor-associated immune cells (TC and TC+IC), mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) by IHC (MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, PMS2), intratumoral CD8+ T-cell density by IHC and quantitative image analysis, desmoplasia scoring by pathology, whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing to derive gene signatures (including interferon-γ [IFN-γ], effector T cells [Teff], activated T cells, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition [EMT], TGF-β fibrosis signatures, angiogenesis, hypoxia, and others), and tumor mutation burden (TMB) derived from whole-exome sequencing in a subset of patients. Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were used to evaluate pathway-level associations with survival and treatment outcomes.\n\nStatistical planning assumed an ORR of 12% for nivolumab monotherapy and sought to detect a 20% absolute improvement with the ADX+NIVO combination, with approximately 83% power at a one-sided 10% significance level using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method. ORR was tested at a two-sided alpha of 0.2, with Clopper-Pearson 95% confidence intervals. ORs for treatment effect were estimated using stratified CMH tests by PD-L1 status. OS and PFS were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age and sex. PFS was defined from randomization to death from any cause or first definitive progression, and OS from randomization to death from any cause. Given the exploratory nature, p values were not adjusted for multiple comparisons.\n\nIn total, 144 patients were randomized (intent-to-treat population), and 141 received at least one dose of study drug (safety population). The median age was approximately 61–62 years; 81% of patients were white, and 69% were male. Patients had a median of 2 prior lines of therapy. Approximately 18% were PD-L1-positive based on tumor cell staining (TC ≥1%), and 72% were positive when tumors and associated immune cells were combined (TC+IC). Only three patients had dMMR tumors, all in the nivolumab-alone arm.\n\nEfficacy results showed that adding ADX to NIVO did not improve outcomes. The ORR was 10% (95% CI 4–19) with ADX+NIVO and 7% (95% CI 2–16) with NIVO alone (odds ratio 1.5; 95% CI 0.4–6.1; p=0.8). Disease control rate (CR+PR+stable disease) was 30.6% with ADX+NIVO and 23.6% with NIVO alone. Median OS was 7.1 months (95% CI 4.8 to not reached) with ADX+NIVO and 5.9 months (95% CI 3.5–10.9) with NIVO alone (HR 1.24; 95% CI 0.49–1.26; p=0.23). Median PFS was similarly not improved with the combination (HR 1.33; 95% CI 0.94–1.88; p=0.10). No patient subgroup derived clear benefit from adding ADX to NIVO.\n\nSafety profiles were comparable between treatment arms. The most common adverse events included fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, and vomiting. Grade ≥3 AEs occurred in about two-thirds of patients, most often anemia and abdominal pain. Serious AEs occurred in 59% (ADX+NIVO) and 54% (NIVO alone), with similar patterns across groups, supporting an acceptable safety profile for the combination but no efficacy advantage.\n\nPaired biopsies (baseline and on-treatment) demonstrated that nivolumab treatment alone increased intratumoral CD8+ T-cell density and T cell–related gene signatures, confirming immune activation by PD-1 blockade in gastric cancer. The addition of ADX led to a numerically larger increase in CD8+ T-cell infiltrates, particularly in PD-L1 (TC+IC)-positive tumors, but this did not translate into higher T cell inflammatory gene signatures or better clinical outcomes. Thus, while there was some evidence of pharmacodynamic activity on CD8+ T cells, MMP9 inhibition did not enhance the antitumor efficacy of nivolumab.\n\nGiven the absence of a combination benefit, data from both treatment arms were pooled to explore biomarkers of response to PD-1–based immunotherapy. PD-L1 positivity was associated with higher response rates and numerically longer OS, although not statistically significant for OS or PFS in multivariable models. Exploratory analyses identified several key associations: (1) gene signatures reflecting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and high TGF-β fibrosis scores were correlated with poorer survival; desmoplastic tumors exhibited higher EMT and TGF-β fibrosis signatures; (2) HER2 (ERBB2) positivity and high expression of genes in the ERBB2 amplicon (e.g., GRB7, PGAP3, MIEN1) were associated with significantly longer survival; most HER2-positive patients had prior trastuzumab exposure, but benefit from PD-1 blockade did not clearly depend on prior trastuzumab response; (3) higher tumor mutation burden (TMB) (at or above the median of 2.01 mutations/Mb) was associated with significantly longer OS and PFS, even in this relatively low-TMB gastric/GEJ population; and (4) in a multivariable model incorporating TMB, TGF-β fibrosis signature, and HER2 status, TMB emerged as the main driver of improved survival.\n\nIn conclusion, this randomized phase 2 study found that andecaliximab, a selective MMP9 inhibitor, added to nivolumab did not improve response, progression-free survival, or overall survival versus nivolumab alone in previously treated metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma, despite a manageable safety profile. Exploratory biomarker analyses suggest that HER2 positivity, higher TMB, and higher GRB7/ERBB2 expression are associated with improved outcomes on PD-1–based therapy, whereas high TGF-β fibrosis signatures and EMT-related pathways are linked to inferior survival.

High risk was defined as node-positive disease or node-negative, hormone receptor–negative tumors larger than 2 cm. Patients were randomly assigned to receive anthracycline-based chemotherapy followed by either taxane plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab (AC-THP) or T-DM1 plus pertuzumab (AC-KP) for about one year. The main outcome was invasive disease-free survival, assessed first in node-positive patients and then in the overall population. The study found no significant improvement in invasive disease-free survival with T-DM1 plus pertuzumab compared with taxane plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, although both regimens achieved high 3-year invasive disease-free survival rates. Overall safety profiles were consistent with prior experience, and quality-of-life deterioration during HER2-targeted therapy was less frequent with T-DM1 plus pertuzumab, largely due to avoidance of taxane-related toxicity."", ""detailedDescription"": ""KAITLIN (NCT01966471) is a phase III, randomized, open-label, multinational clinical trial conducted in 288 centers across 36 countries to investigate adjuvant treatment strategies for high-risk HER2-positive early breast cancer (EBC). Eligible patients were adults with newly diagnosed, operable, nonmetastatic, histologically confirmed HER2-positive invasive breast carcinoma that had been surgically excised. High risk was defined as either (1) lymph node–positive disease (pN ≥ 1), with any tumor size except T0 and any hormone receptor status, or (2) node-negative disease (pN0) with tumor size > 2.0 cm and hormone receptor–negative status (estrogen receptor– and progesterone receptor–negative). HER2 positivity was centrally confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC 3+) and/or in situ hybridization (HER2:chromosome 17 ratio ≥ 2.0).\n\nWithin 9 weeks after definitive breast surgery, patients were randomized 1:1 to one of two adjuvant treatment arms, both beginning with anthracycline-based chemotherapy (three or four cycles of investigator’s choice of FEC, AC, or EC). After completion of anthracycline therapy and an interval of at least 3 weeks, patients received HER2-targeted therapy for a planned duration of one year, in combination with either a taxane or trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1):\n\n• Control arm (AC-THP): anthracycline chemotherapy followed by a taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel) plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Trastuzumab was given every 3 weeks (8 mg/kg loading, then 6 mg/kg), and pertuzumab every 3 weeks (840 mg loading, then 420 mg). After completion of the taxane phase, trastuzumab plus pertuzumab was continued to complete at least one year of HER2-targeted therapy.\n\n• Experimental arm (AC-KP): anthracycline chemotherapy followed by T-DM1 plus pertuzumab. T-DM1 was administered at 3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks, with pertuzumab dosed as in the control arm, for a total planned duration of at least one year of HER2-targeted therapy.\n\nDose delays and reductions were permitted for anthracyclines, taxanes, and T-DM1; only delays (no reductions) were allowed for trastuzumab and pertuzumab. For patients in the T-DM1 arm who discontinued T-DM1 due to toxicity, a switch to trastuzumab was recommended to complete at least one year of HER2-directed therapy. Adjuvant radiotherapy and/or endocrine therapy was administered as clinically indicated, typically after taxane chemotherapy in the control arm or after four cycles of T-DM1 in the experimental arm.\n\nThe coprimary efficacy endpoints were invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) in the intention-to-treat node-positive population and in the overall randomized population. IDFS was defined as time from randomization to first occurrence of ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence, ipsilateral locoregional invasive breast cancer recurrence, contralateral or ipsilateral second primary invasive breast cancer, distant recurrence, or death from any cause. Secondary endpoints included IDFS plus second primary nonbreast cancer, disease-free survival (including ductal carcinoma in situ events), distant recurrence-free interval, and overall survival (OS). Adverse events were assessed using CTCAE v4.0. Cardiac endpoints included adjudicated primary cardiac events (severe heart failure, significant LVEF decline, or cardiac death) and secondary cardiac events (symptomatic or asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction with LVEF decline). Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 questionnaires, focusing on global health status/quality of life, functioning, and symptoms, with clinically meaningful deterioration generally defined as a ≥ 10-point decrease from baseline.\n\nThe statistical design targeted approximately 171 IDFS events in the overall population and 160 in the node-positive subpopulation to provide ~80–82.5% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.64 at a two-sided 5% significance level using a stratified log-rank test. A hierarchical testing procedure controlled the overall type I error at 5%: IDFS in node-positive patients, then IDFS in the overall population, followed by OS in node-positive patients and OS in the overall population. After results from the metastatic MARIANNE trial indicated noninferiority but not superiority of T-DM1-based regimens versus taxane plus trastuzumab, the planned sample size in KAITLIN was reduced from 2,500 to approximately 1,850 patients without altering the event-driven power assumptions.\n\nBetween January 2014 and June 2015, 1,846 patients were enrolled (918 AC-THP; 928 AC-KP); 1,658 (89.8%) were node-positive. Median follow-up was about 57 months in both arms. There were 82 (9.9%) IDFS events in the AC-THP arm and 80 (9.6%) in the AC-KP arm among node-positive patients, yielding a stratified HR of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.71–1.32; P = .83). Because the primary comparison in node-positive patients was not statistically significant, hierarchical testing was stopped. In the overall population, 88 (9.6%) and 86 (9.3%) IDFS events occurred in the AC-THP and AC-KP arms, respectively (stratified HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.72–1.32). Three-year IDFS rates in the overall population were 94.2% (95% CI, 92.7–95.8) for AC-THP and 93.1% (95% CI, 91.4–94.7) for AC-KP, with similar patterns in node-positive patients. Secondary endpoints, including disease-free survival and distant recurrence-free interval, were also comparable between arms. OS data were immature at the time of analysis, with low event rates (3.6% vs 4.7% in AC-THP vs AC-KP).\n\nIn the safety population (1,838 treated patients), completion of all 18 cycles of trastuzumab or T-DM1 occurred in 88.4% of AC-THP patients and 65.0% of AC-KP patients; when including those who switched from T-DM1 to trastuzumab, 81.5% in AC-KP completed planned HER2-directed therapy. Grade 3 or higher adverse events and serious adverse events occurred at similar rates across arms (approximately 55% vs 52% for grade ≥ 3 events and 23% vs 21% for serious adverse events in AC-THP vs AC-KP). Discontinuation of T-DM1 was notably higher than for trastuzumab (26.8% vs 4.0%), mainly because of laboratory abnormalities such as elevated bilirubin and thrombocytopenia. Overall cardiac event rates were low in both arms, with slightly fewer primary and secondary cardiac events in the T-DM1 arm. T-DM1 was associated with increased rates of hepatotoxicity, thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhage compared to the taxane–trastuzumab regimen, while taxane-related toxicities (e.g., neuropathy, myalgia, arthralgia, and alopecia) are acknowledged but detailed incidence values are not fully reported in the extract.\n\nPRO analyses showed that during the anthracycline phase, patients in both arms experienced deterioration in quality of life and functioning. From the start of HER2-targeted therapy, functioning stabilized in the AC-KP arm but continued to worsen in the AC-THP arm during taxane administration, then improved after taxane completion, ultimately converging with AC-KP. Time-to-event analyses demonstrated a 29% reduction in risk of clinically meaningful deterioration in global health status/quality of life from the start of HER2-targeted therapy in the AC-KP arm compared with AC-THP (stratified HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.62–0.80), with similar patterns for physical and role functioning.\n\nOverall, KAITLIN did not demonstrate superiority of adjuvant anthracycline followed by T-DM1 plus pertuzumab over anthracycline followed by taxane plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab in terms of IDFS in high-risk HER2-positive early breast cancer. Both regimens achieved high IDFS rates and had safety profiles consistent with previous experience. The trial supports the continued use of taxane plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab–based chemotherapy as the standard adjuvant regimen in this setting. In the context of evolving treatment paradigms, where neoadjuvant trastuzumab/pertuzumab plus chemotherapy followed by adjuvant T-DM1 for residual disease is now standard, these results reinforce a tailored strategy that maintains intensive HER2-targeted therapy while exploring chemotherapy de-escalation in selected patients and therapy escalation (including T-DM1) for those with residual high-risk disease.""}","{""conditions"": [""Breast Neoplasms"", ""Breast Neoplasms, HER2-Positive"", ""Early Breast Cancer"", ""Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast""], ""keywords"": [""HER2-positive breast cancer"", ""Early breast cancer"", ""High-risk breast cancer"", ""Adjuvant chemotherapy"", ""Anthracyclines"", ""Taxanes"", ""Trastuzumab"", ""Pertuzumab"", ""Trastuzumab emtansine"", ""T-DM1"", ""Antibody-drug conjugates"", ""Invasive disease-free survival"", ""Disease-free survival"", ""Distant recurrence-free interval"", ""Overall survival"", ""Quality of life"", ""EORTC QLQ-C30"", ""EORTC QLQ-BR23"", ""Cardiotoxicity"", ""Hepatotoxicity"", ""Thrombocytopenia"", ""Adjuvant therapy"", ""Node-positive breast cancer"", ""Hormone receptor–negative breast cancer""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE3""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Multinational, randomized, open-label, parallel-group phase III trial comparing anthracycline-based chemotherapy followed by taxane plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab (AC-THP) versus anthracycline-based chemotherapy followed by trastuzumab emtansine plus pertuzumab (AC-KP) in high-risk HER2-positive early breast cancer."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": ""COHORT"", ""timePerspective"": ""PROSPECTIVE"", ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Open-label study with no blinding; treatment assignments were known to investigators and participants."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 1846, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""AC-THP"", ""type"": ""ACTIVE_COMPARATOR"", ""description"": ""Anthracycline-based chemotherapy (three or four cycles of investigator's choice regimen: FEC, AC, or EC) followed by a taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel, three or four cycles) plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab.

Adult patients with advanced cancer, prior to receiving their tumor sequencing results, were randomized to either a self-directed, mobile-ready web education intervention or usual care (any information they would normally receive from providers or seek on their own). The main outcomes were changes in genetic knowledge and distress (general anxiety, depression, state anxiety, and cancer-specific distress) measured before education, shortly after education, and after disclosure of tumor sequencing results. The study found that web-based education significantly increased genetic knowledge overall, reduced cancer-specific distress among women, but did not significantly change distress outcomes in the full sample. Patients with lower health literacy who received the intervention experienced more distress and less improvement in anxiety and depression, suggesting a need to refine the approach for low-literacy groups and men."", ""detailedDescription"": ""The Communication and Education in Tumor Profiling (COMET) study (ECOG-ACRIN EAQ152) is a multicenter randomized trial designed to assess the psychosocial and educational impact of a web-based genetic education intervention for patients with advanced cancer undergoing tumor-only genetic sequencing. The study was conducted through the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group and the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP), and was linked to the National Cancer Institute Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (NCI-MATCH, EAY131) precision oncology trial.\n\nRationale: As massively parallel sequencing has become integrated into precision oncology, tumor genomic profiling is increasingly used to identify actionable mutations and guide targeted therapy. However, there are no established guidelines for pretest counseling for tumor genetic testing, and patients with advanced cancer often have limited understanding of genetic concepts, the distinction between somatic (tumor) and germline testing, and the realistic benefits and limitations of testing. Prior qualitative work has reported misunderstanding, disappointment, distress, and loss of hope following tumor genetic testing, underscoring the need for scalable, patient-centered pretest education. Workforce limitations in genetic counseling and the time-sensitive nature of treatment decisions further support the need for efficient eHealth education strategies.\n\nIntervention: The COMET intervention is a self-directed, mobile-ready, web-based genetic education program informed by the tiered-binned model for genetic education and informed consent. It provides core (tier 1) \""indispensable\"" information and optional (tier 2) content to support varying information needs. The linear intervention consists of six modules and four optional videos featuring a genetic counselor, covering topics such as:\n- Introduction to the COMET study and the intervention,\n- Basic genetics and genomics (DNA, genetic changes, tumor mutations),\n- Differences between somatic (tumor) and germline genetic changes,\n- The purpose and process of tumor genetic testing,\n- Potential findings and what tumor test results may mean for treatment and for family members,\n- Potential germline implications of tumor findings,\n- Benefits, risks, and limitations of tumor genetic testing,\n- Review of key concepts and encouragement to complete surveys.\nThe content was user-tested in a small group of patients with advanced cancer to ensure clarity and relevance. Participants could navigate the modules flexibly, repeat content as desired, and access links to additional public educational resources (eg, National Cancer Institute, Penn Medicine Diagnostics).\n\nStudy Design and Population: From 2016 to 2019, 594 English-speaking adults with advanced cancer and access to email and the web were enrolled across 74 sites. The first 194 participants were drawn from NCI-MATCH before that trial reached its sequencing goal; an additional 400 patients meeting MATCH eligibility criteria were recruited from other site-based tumor sequencing programs once MATCH closed to such accrual. All participants had consented to tumor-only sequencing and had not yet received their tumor genetic results at the time of COMET enrollment.\n\nParticipants were randomized 1:1 to receive either:\n- Arm A (Intervention): Web-based genetic education plus usual care, or\n- Arm B (Usual Care): Usual provider education and any information patients sought themselves, without the COMET web intervention.\nRandomization was stratified by sex (male vs female), race (White vs non-White), age (≤65 vs >65 years), and education (high school or less vs some college vs post-bachelor). After informed consent and registration, participants completed a baseline (T0) patient-reported outcomes (PRO) survey. Intervention-arm participants were then emailed access to the web program and asked to complete a post-education (T1) survey after using the intervention; if the intervention was not accessed, T1 was sent 9 days after T0. Usual-care-arm participants received T1 six days after T0. Tumor sequencing results were disclosed according to usual clinical practice (typically by the treating oncologist, with no standardized disclosure protocol), and a post-disclosure (T2) survey was administered after research staff documented disclosure or at a time window intended to capture most result returns (approximately 2–3 weeks after expected result availability). Patients were asked to confirm whether they had received results immediately before T2.\n\nPrimary Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were changes from baseline in:\n1. Genetic knowledge (T0–T1 and T0–T2) using a modified ClinSeq knowledge scale adapted for tumor genetic testing.\n2. General anxiety (T0–T1 and T0–T2) measured by 4-item PROMIS Anxiety short form.\n3. Depression (T0–T1 and T0–T2) measured by 4-item PROMIS Depression short form.\n4. State anxiety (T0–T1 and T0–T2) measured using 20 items from the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (state subscale).\n5. Cancer-specific distress (T0–T1 and T0–T2) measured with a 14-item adapted Impact of Event Scale specific to cancer/tumor profiling.\n\nSecondary measures included health literacy (3-item scale, higher scores indicating lower literacy), uncertainty about tumor genetic testing (adapted from the uncertainty subscale of the MICRA), perceived utility of tumor genetic testing (10-item scale assessing perceived usefulness of genetic information), and satisfaction with disclosure of results (9-item adapted scale).\n\nStatistical Analysis: The primary analyses used a two-sample t-test to compare mean change scores between the intervention and usual-care arms for each primary outcome (T0–T1 and T0–T2) using an intention-to-treat framework, regardless of actual intervention uptake. A Bonferroni-corrected two-sided alpha of 0.005 was used for the ten primary comparisons. Sample size calculations based on pilot data suggested that 200 evaluable patients per arm at T1 would yield high power (≥91%) to detect differences in primary outcomes, and 150 evaluable patients per arm at T2 would yield adequate power for key outcomes, particularly cancer-specific distress. Potential baseline imbalances (p<0.1) were to be adjusted via linear regression, though none met this threshold in practice. Moderator analyses used generalized linear models to evaluate two-way interactions between arm and patient factors (age, sex, race, education, health literacy) with a nominal alpha of 0.05 for these exploratory analyses.\n\nResults: Of 594 randomized patients (293 intervention, 301 usual care), 79% completed the baseline survey. The median age was 64 years, 56% were women, 94% identified as White, 45% had common cancers, and 36% had a high school education or less. Most (80%) were enrolled from NCORP community sites. Baseline demographics and primary outcome scores were similar between arms. Among intervention-arm patients with T0 data, 93% accessed the web education. T1 survey completion was 89% in the intervention arm and 88% in usual care; T2 completion was 71% and 66%, respectively.\n\nPrimary Efficacy Findings:\n- Knowledge: The intervention significantly increased genetic knowledge from T0 to T1 and from T0 to T2 compared with usual care (p<0.0001 and p=0.003, respectively). This effect persisted over time, indicating that web-based education produced sustained improvements in patients' understanding of tumor genetic testing.\n- Distress Outcomes: There were no statistically significant differences between arms in changes in general anxiety, depression, state anxiety, or cancer-specific distress in the overall sample for either T0–T1 or T0–T2.\n\nModerator Analyses:\n- Sex: Among women, the intervention produced a greater decrease in cancer-specific distress from T0 to T1 compared with usual care (mean change −2.4 vs +0.9; p=0.01), suggesting that web-based education can mitigate cancer-related distress in female patients. No such effect was seen in men (interaction p=0.052), indicating potential sex-specific differences in response to the intervention.\n- Health Literacy: Lower health literacy moderated intervention effects adversely. Patients with lower health literacy in the intervention arm showed greater increases in cancer-specific distress from T0 to T1 and greater increases in depression from T0 to T2, and experienced less improvement (and possibly slight worsening) in general anxiety compared with similar patients in the usual-care arm. Baseline distress was also higher among lower-literacy participants, independent of treatment arm. These relationships remained significant after adjusting for baseline distress, suggesting that the negative moderating effect of low literacy is not solely explained by pre-existing anxiety or depression.\n\nSecondary Outcomes: No significant between-arm differences were observed in changes in uncertainty about tumor genetic testing, perceived utility of testing, or satisfaction with result disclosure. Many patients did not clearly recall whether results had been formally disclosed, highlighting the complexity and variability of disclosure practices in routine oncology care.\n\nConclusions and Implications: This study demonstrates that a scalable, web-based genetic education tool can effectively increase patient knowledge regarding tumor genomic profiling in a large, predominantly community-based advanced cancer population. While the intervention did not significantly reduce distress outcomes overall, it decreased cancer-specific distress among women, indicating potential benefits for selected subgroups. At the same time, patients with lower health literacy experienced transient increases in distress and less improvement in anxiety and depression after the intervention, emphasizing the need to tailor eHealth genetic education to literacy levels and to integrate additional psychosocial support for vulnerable groups.\n\nThe COMET study provides empirical data to inform practice guidelines for pretest education in tumor genomic testing, suggesting that web-based platforms can complement oncology providers by delivering standardized, accessible information. Future refinements could include simplification of language, alternative formats for low-literacy populations, and targeted interventions for men and those with higher baseline distress. Further research is needed to standardize and optimize the disclosure of tumor sequencing results and to evaluate how educational interventions interact with different types of test results (e.g., actionable vs nonactionable findings, potential germline implications) and testing modalities (tumor-only vs paired tumor-germline).""}","{""conditions"": [""Advanced Cancer"", ""Neoplasms"", ""Solid Tumors""], ""keywords"": [""Precision Oncology"", ""Tumor Profiling"", ""Tumor Genetic Testing"", ""Somatic Mutation"", ""Germline Mutation"", ""Genetic Counseling"", ""Genetic Education"", ""Health Literacy"", ""Anxiety"", ""Depression"", ""Psychological Distress"", ""Cancer-specific Distress"", ""Patient-Reported Outcomes"", ""NCI-MATCH Trial"", ""Web-based Intervention"", ""eHealth"", ""Molecular Profiling"", ""Targeted Therapy"", ""Impact of Event Scale"", ""PROMIS"", ""State-Trait Anxiety Inventory""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Two-arm randomized trial comparing a web-based genetic education intervention (Arm A) versus usual care (Arm B) in patients with advanced cancer undergoing tumor-only genetic sequencing; participants were randomized 1:1, stratified by gender, race, age, and education level."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""No blinding was described; participants and providers were aware of assignment to web-based education versus usual care."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 594, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Web-based genetic education intervention"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Patients with advanced cancer undergoing tumor-only genetic sequencing received access to the COMET web-based genetic education program before disclosure of tumor sequencing results.

Patients were randomized to receive either favipiravir plus standard care or standard care alone, and the main outcome was how long it took for their respiratory samples to become PCR‑negative for the virus. The study also explored effects on clinical recovery, need for respiratory support, and safety."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This phase 2, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial (NCT04358549) was conducted at 7 US academic medical centers from April through October 2020 to assess the safety and antiviral activity of favipiravir in adults hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). Eligible participants were 18–80 years old, hospitalized with a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal PCR‑positive test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) within 72 hours of hospitalization and within 7 days of their first positive PCR (later restricted to symptom onset within 10 days). Patients were randomized within 72 hours of hospitalization to receive either favipiravir plus standard of care (SOC) or SOC alone, and were stratified by disease severity (critical, severe, or mild to moderate).\n\nFavipiravir, an oral nucleoside analog with broad‑spectrum activity against RNA viruses and licensed in Japan for refractory influenza, was dosed at 1800 mg twice daily on day 1, followed by 1000 mg twice daily for 13 days (800 mg twice daily in patients with Child‑Pugh A liver disease). Treatment was planned for 14 days and continued after discharge, with a total follow‑up of 46 days after the active treatment phase. Concomitant use of other antivirals, immunomodulators, and most systemic steroids was initially excluded, though dexamethasone 6 mg daily was permitted after publication of the RECOVERY trial.\n\nThe primary endpoint was time to viral clearance by day 29, defined as time from randomization to the first SARS‑CoV‑2 PCR result that was negative or below the lower limit of quantification, without subsequent positives, based on scheduled nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. Key secondary endpoints included clinical recovery assessed by a study‑specific 6‑point ordinal scale, time to clinical recovery (normalization of fever, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and improvement of cough), changes in National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2), need for supplemental oxygen or ventilatory support, all‑cause mortality, duration of hospitalization, time to defervescence, changes in SARS‑CoV‑2 viral load (including time to RT‑PCR negativity and area under the viral load curve), requirement for mechanical ventilation, C‑reactive protein over time, and a population pharmacokinetic analysis of favipiravir and its metabolite.\n\nFifty patients were enrolled (25 per arm). Baseline characteristics differed slightly: the SOC group was older with more patients ≥65 years, while the favipiravir group had more severe illness at entry, including critical disease and greater need for noninvasive ventilation. Nineteen patients were censored from the primary endpoint because they were PCR‑negative at the research lab on day 1, remained PCR‑positive at day 29, or were lost to follow‑up (including some censored at day 29 due to clinical worsening).\n\nAmong the 50 randomized patients (intention‑to‑treat analysis), the median time to viral clearance was 16.0 days (90% CI, 12.0–29.0) in the favipiravir group versus 30.0 days (90% CI, 12.0–31.0) in the SOC group, with a statistically significant difference by log‑rank test (P = .0415), indicating enhanced viral clearance with favipiravir. Clinical outcomes, including time to clinical recovery, NEWS2 improvement, and duration of hospitalization, did not show significant differences between groups, though trends included a numerically shorter time to NEWS2 ≤2 or discharge with favipiravir and a longer mean hospitalization driven largely by one favipiravir‑treated patient with multiple comorbidities and a prolonged complicated hospital stay.\n\nSafety analyses showed that favipiravir was generally well tolerated. Treatment‑emergent adverse events occurred with similar frequency in both arms. The most common events with favipiravir were elevated gamma‑glutamyltransferase and acute kidney injury; in the SOC group, increases in inflammatory markers and respiratory failure were more frequent. There were more serious adverse events in the SOC arm numerically, but the single death occurred in a favipiravir‑treated patient after discharge due to a cerebral bleed judged unrelated to study drug or COVID‑19.\n\nPharmacokinetic data demonstrated that oral favipiravir achieved and maintained plasma concentrations above the in vitro EC50 for SARS‑CoV‑2 throughout the 14‑day course, with mean postdose levels ranging from approximately 22 to 42 µg/mL and substantial exposure (AUC0–24h) on days 1, 8, and 14. Levels of the metabolite T‑705 M1 were also quantified.\n\nPost hoc analyses explored factors influencing antiviral response. In patients who were neutralizing antibody‑negative (at or below the assay lower limit of quantification) at baseline, favipiravir was associated with a more pronounced acceleration of viral clearance compared with SOC, whereas no clear benefit was observed in those who already had higher neutralizing antibody titers at randomization. Similarly, when patients were stratified by time from symptom onset to randomization, an apparent antiviral benefit of favipiravir was seen primarily among those treated within 7 days of symptom onset; patients randomized after 8 or more days showed no clear advantage.\n\nOverall, this proof‑of‑concept trial demonstrates that favipiravir can be safely administered to hospitalized adults with COVID‑19 and can shorten the duration of SARS‑CoV‑2 RNA shedding as measured by PCR, particularly when given before substantial antibody development and earlier in the disease course. The findings support further evaluation of favipiravir, especially as an early oral treatment or prophylactic option for individuals at high risk of severe COVID‑19, including potential use in outpatient or post‑exposure settings.""}","{""conditions"": [""COVID-19"", ""Coronavirus Infections"", ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection"", ""Pneumonia, Viral""], ""keywords"": [""Favipiravir"", ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""Coronavirus Infections"", ""Antiviral Agents"", ""RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Inhibitors"", ""Viral Clearance"", ""Hospitalization"", ""Neutralizing Antibodies"", ""Phase II Clinical Trial""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Phase 2 randomized, open-label, multicenter, parallel-group trial comparing favipiravir plus standard of care vs standard of care alone in hospitalized adults with PCR-confirmed COVID-19."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Open-label trial with no blinding; both participants and investigators were aware of treatment assignment."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 50, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Favipiravir plus Standard of Care"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Hospitalized adults with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 randomized to receive oral favipiravir in addition to site standard of care.

These findings support further evaluation in larger randomized trials."", ""detailedDescription"": ""MM1636 is an investigator‑initiated, nonrandomized, open‑label, single‑center phase 1/2 clinical trial conducted at Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Denmark (NCT03047928; EudraCT 2016‑0004527‑23). The study tests a first‑in‑class immune‑modulatory cancer vaccine strategy that targets non‑mutated immune‑regulatory molecules, indoleamine 2,3‑dioxygenase (IDO) and PD‑L1, in combination with PD‑1 blockade in metastatic melanoma.\n\nRationale and hypothesis: Many patients with metastatic melanoma exhibit primary or acquired resistance to anti‑PD‑1 monotherapy, and combined anti‑PD‑1/anti‑CTLA‑4 therapy, while more effective, is associated with high rates of severe toxicity. IDO and PD‑L1 are expressed by melanoma cells and multiple cell types in the tumor microenvironment, where they contribute to immune suppression. Naturally occurring IDO‑ and PD‑L1‑specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells can recognize and kill IDO+/PD‑L1+ tumor cells and immunosuppressive myeloid or other immune cells, and can secrete pro‑inflammatory cytokines. The trial is based on the hypothesis that vaccination with IDO‑ and PD‑L1‑derived peptides (IO102/IO103) will expand and activate these specific T cells, leading to elimination of IDO/PD‑L1‑expressing immunosuppressive cells, induction of a TH1‑type inflammatory milieu, increased T‑cell infiltration, and adaptive upregulation of PD‑L1, thereby making tumors more susceptible to nivolumab. Preclinical models had shown synergistic antitumor effects of IDO vaccination plus anti‑PD‑1 therapy.\n\nStudy population and design: The full MM1636 trial planned three cohorts: (A) 30 anti‑PD‑1–naïve patients with metastatic melanoma; (B) 10 patients with de novo anti‑PD‑1 resistance; and (C) 10 patients with acquired resistance after anti‑PD‑1 therapy, for a total of 50 patients. The current report describes cohort A only. Eligible patients were adults (≥18 years) with locally advanced or stage IV melanoma (AJCC 7th/8th editions), at least one measurable lesion by RECIST 1.1, ECOG performance status 0–1, and no prior anti‑PD‑1 therapy. Patients with active significant autoimmune disease or CNS metastases >1 cm were excluded. PD‑L1 status, BRAF status, LDH level, and M stage were documented but not used as inclusion criteria. Thirty patients were enrolled between December 2017 and June 2020. Baseline characteristics included mean age 70 years, 60% M1c disease, 37% BRAF‑mutant disease, and 43% PD‑L1–negative tumors (<1% by clone 28‑8). A small proportion (10%) had prior ipilimumab exposure. No patients had brain metastases.\n\nIntervention: The investigational vaccine consists of two synthetic long peptides: IO102, a 21‑mer peptide derived from IDO (DTLLKALLEIASCLEKALQVF), and IO103, a 19‑mer peptide derived from the PD‑L1 signal peptide (FMTYWHLLNAFTVTVPKDL). Each vaccine dose contains 100 μg of IO102 plus 100 μg of IO103, dissolved in DMSO and emulsified in Montanide ISA‑51 adjuvant to a final volume of 1 mL for subcutaneous injection. Nivolumab was administered intravenously at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks for up to 24 cycles; after completion of the vaccination schedule, clinically benefiting patients could continue nivolumab at 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks for up to 2 years as standard of care.\n\nTreatment schedule: Vaccination was given subcutaneously every 2 weeks for the first six injections (induction phase) and then every 4 weeks up to a maximum of 15 injections (approximately 9 months). Nivolumab was started in parallel and continued for a maximum of 24 cycles at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, with optional continuation at 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks thereafter in responders. Patients underwent baseline FDG PET–CT imaging, serial PET–CT every 3 months for response assessment, and, when feasible, tumor needle biopsies at baseline and after six treatment cycles. Delayed‑type hypersensitivity (DTH) tests with peptide injection without adjuvant followed by punch biopsies were performed after six cycles to study skin‑infiltrating lymphocytes (SKILs). Peripheral blood was collected at multiple time points for immunomonitoring.\n\nObjectives and endpoints: The primary objective was to assess feasibility, safety, and tolerability of the IDO/PD‑L1 vaccine plus nivolumab. Secondary objectives included assessment of clinical efficacy (objective response rate, progression‑free survival, overall survival, duration of response) and immunogenicity, including induction, phenotype, and trafficking of IDO‑ and PD‑L1‑specific T cells. Tumor responses were investigator‑assessed using RECIST 1.1 and validated by an independent blinded radiology review. Survival endpoints were analyzed by Kaplan–Meier methods. To explore whether the observed efficacy exceeded that expected from nivolumab alone, outcomes were compared with a matched historical control cohort from the Danish Metastatic Melanoma Database treated with anti‑PD‑1 monotherapy.\n\nSafety and tolerability: Among 30 treated patients, systemic toxicity was comparable to reported profiles of nivolumab monotherapy. Common treatment‑related grade 1–2 adverse events included fatigue, rash, arthralgia, diarrhea, nausea, dry skin, pruritus, infusion reactions, xerostomia, and myalgia. Four patients (13%) experienced grade 3–4 events: maculopapular rash, adrenal insufficiency, arthralgia, and multiple immune‑related toxicities in one patient who died from urosepsis and suspected myocarditis in the setting of severe nivolumab‑related immune adverse events. Local injection‑site reactions occurred in 77% of patients (granulomas, erythema, pain, pruritus), all grade 1–2, and attributed largely to Montanide; two patients discontinued vaccination due to persistent granulomas and tenderness but continued nivolumab. No signal of increased systemic autoimmunity attributable specifically to the vaccine was evident.\n\nClinical efficacy: By investigator review, the overall objective response rate (ORR) was 80% (95% CI, 62.7–90.5%), with 43% (95% CI, 27.4–60.8%) complete responses (CRs) and 37% partial responses (PRs); 20% experienced progressive disease as best response. Responses often occurred early, with 22 of 30 patients achieving an objective response by week 12. Median time to PR was 75 days and to CR 327 days. Independent blinded review confirmed a high ORR of 76.6%, with a 53.3% CR rate. Responses were observed irrespective of PD‑L1 status and HLA genotype: PD‑L1–positive patients (>1%) had an ORR of 94.1%, whereas PD‑L1–negative patients (<1%) had an ORR of 61.5%. At the time of analysis, with a median follow‑up of 22.9 months, median progression‑free survival was 26 months (95% CI, 15.4–69 months) for the whole cohort and not reached among responders; median overall survival had not been reached, with 12‑month OS 81.6%. In comparison, a matched historical control group (n=74) treated with anti‑PD‑1 monotherapy showed an ORR of 41.7%, CR rate of 12%, median PFS of 8.3 months, and median OS of 23.2 months. Weighted logistic and Cox regression analyses indicated significantly higher response and CR rates and prolonged PFS in MM1636, supporting an added effect beyond nivolumab alone, acknowledging limitations of nonrandomized design and potential biases in synthetic control comparisons.\n\nImmunogenicity and mechanistic findings:\n- Peripheral blood: Modified in vitro IFN‑γ ELISPOT assays showed that 33% and 27% of patients had detectable IDO‑ and PD‑L1‑specific T cells at baseline, respectively. During vaccination, 93% of patients exhibited increased IDO‑ or PD‑L1‑specific T cell responses, with statistically significant median increases from baseline. Ex vivo ELISPOT and flow cytometry confirmed frequent induction of CD4+ and CD8+ vaccine‑specific T cells expressing activation and cytolytic markers (CD107a, CD137) and producing IFN‑γ and TNF‑α. Responses fluctuated over time and persisted in many patients 3–6 months after the last vaccination, consistent with memory formation. Vaccine‑specific responses were observed across diverse HLA types.\n- Skin/DTH site: SKIL cultures derived from DTH biopsies after six cycles demonstrated IDO‑ and PD‑L1‑specific T cells in the skin in most tested patients, primarily CD4+ cells with TNF‑α production and degranulation capacity. TCR sequencing of PD‑L1‑specific SKILs showed clonal expansions, and some dominant skin clones were also detected in tumor biopsies, supporting tissue trafficking.\n- Tumor and TCR repertoire: Paired tumor biopsies and serial blood samples from five patients (three responders, two non‑responders) underwent TCRβ CDR3 sequencing and immunohistochemistry. Responders displayed increased T cell fractions and higher densities of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells in tumors after treatment, whereas a non‑responder showed decreased T‑cell infiltration and immune escape via loss of MHC class I and lack of PD‑L1/IDO upregulation. Vaccine‑enriched IDO/PD‑L1‑specific clones identified from peripheral cultures were more frequent in post‑treatment biopsies in most patients, indicating recruitment to tumors. In blood, responders exhibited decreased Simpson clonality and increased richness at early time points, suggestive of broad peripheral expansion and trafficking, while non‑responders showed the opposite. In tumors, responders tended to show increased clonality and decreased richness, consistent with focused expansions of selected T cell clones. Many tumor‑expanded clones were detectable in peripheral blood at baseline and expanded following therapy, suggesting that pre‑existing tumor‑associated T cells were boosted by the combination treatment.\n- Gene expression and checkpoint modulation: NanoString profiling of two responding patients demonstrated increased expression of genes associated with T cell activation, effector function (IFNG, TNF, IL15, IL18), cytotoxicity, and multiple immune checkpoints (PD‑1, PD‑L1, PD‑L2, CTLA‑4, TIM‑3, IDO) in post‑treatment samples, indicative of an inflamed, activated tumor microenvironment. IHC in four patients showed upregulation of PD‑L1, IDO, MHC class I and, in most cases, class II on tumor cells in responders after treatment, but not in the non‑responder.\n- Functional assays: Vaccine‑expanded CD4+ and CD8+ T cell cultures and clones from patients recognized cognate IDO‑ and PD‑L1‑derived peptides, as well as autologous PD‑L1+ or IDO+ tumor cells and tumor‑conditioned myeloid cells, in an antigen‑ and HLA‑restricted, target‑expression–dependent manner. T cells produced IFN‑γ, TNF‑α and displayed degranulation markers upon recognition. PD‑L1‑specific CD4+ T cells recognized autologous tumor cells and CD14+ myeloid cells whose PD‑L1 expression was upregulated by tumor‑conditioned medium. An HLA‑DR‑restricted IDO‑specific CD4+ clone recognized an HLA‑DR‑matched IDO+ monocytic leukemia cell line and autologous myeloid cells, dependent on IDO expression. These data support the concept that vaccine‑induced T cells can directly target both tumor and immunosuppressive myeloid compartments.\n\nOverall, this phase 1/2 study demonstrates that combining an IDO/PD‑L1‑targeting peptide vaccine with nivolumab in anti‑PD‑1–naïve metastatic melanoma patients is feasible, has a safety profile comparable to nivolumab monotherapy aside from expected local vaccine reactions, induces robust and durable vaccine‑specific T cell responses in blood, skin, and tumors, remodels the tumor microenvironment toward a pro‑inflammatory, checkpoint‑rich state, and is associated with a high objective and complete response rate and prolonged progression‑free survival compared to historical nivolumab monotherapy cohorts. The authors conclude that larger randomized trials are required to validate efficacy, better define the vaccine’s independent contribution, and explore its use in anti‑PD‑1‑resistant disease.""}","{""conditions"": [""Melanoma"", ""Metastatic Melanoma"", ""Advanced Melanoma"", ""Skin Neoplasms""], ""keywords"": [""Melanoma"", ""Metastatic Melanoma"", ""Advanced Melanoma"", ""Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors"", ""Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor"", ""PD-1"", ""Nivolumab"", ""Programmed Death-Ligand 1"", ""PD-L1"", ""Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase"", ""IDO"", ""Cancer Vaccines"", ""Peptide Vaccine"", ""Immunotherapy"", ""Tumor Microenvironment"", ""T-Lymphocytes"", ""CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes"", ""CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes"", ""Immune Resistance"", ""Checkpoint Blockade""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE1"", ""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""NON_RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""SINGLE_GROUP"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Investigator-initiated, open-label, single-center phase 1/2 study with a single treatment arm combining an IDO/PD-L1 (IO102/IO103) peptide vaccine and nivolumab in anti–PD-1–naive metastatic melanoma patients (cohort A)."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": ""COHORT"", ""timePerspective"": ""PROSPECTIVE"", ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Open-label trial; all participants and investigators were aware of the administered combination of IO102/IO103 vaccine and nivolumab."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 30, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""IO102/IO103 IDO/PD-L1 Vaccine plus Nivolumab (Cohort A, anti-PD-1–naive metastatic melanoma)"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Single-arm, open-label phase 1/2 cohort of 30 anti-PD-1–naive patients with metastatic melanoma (MM) treated with a first‑in‑class IDO/PD-L1–targeting peptide vaccine (IO102/IO103) in combination with nivolumab.

The study focuses on adults undergoing sleeve gastrectomy who are free of major bone disorders and have adequate baseline calcium and vitamin D levels."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This pilot, quadruple‑blinded, randomized controlled trial investigates whether a one‑time intravenous infusion of zoledronic acid can mitigate bone loss that occurs after sleeve gastrectomy (SG), a commonly performed bariatric surgery for obesity. SG is associated with rapid weight loss but also with clinically significant reductions in bone mineral density (BMD), particularly at the hip and femoral neck, comparable to several years of postmenopausal bone loss and potentially increasing fracture risk.\n\nAdults (≥19 years) scheduled to undergo SG at a single academic bariatric center are screened and enrolled if they weigh <350 lbs (158.8 kg), have adequate serum calcium and 25‑hydroxyvitamin D levels, and are free of major bone‑impacting diseases or medications. Women must be postmenopausal or otherwise incapable of childbearing (e.g., with documented non‑hormonal intrauterine devices), given potential fetal risks from zoledronic acid. Exclusion criteria include prior bariatric surgery, significant liver or renal disease, mineral metabolism abnormalities (hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia), vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL), bone‑modifying disorders, use of bone‑active medications, bisphosphonate sensitivity, recent or planned extensive dental work, type 1 diabetes, current malignancy, and autoimmune diseases affecting bone (such as rheumatoid arthritis).\n\nParticipants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio, using computer‑generated block randomization stratified by sex, to receive either zoledronic acid 5 mg or placebo (normal saline). The study drug is administered as a 100 mL intravenous infusion over 30 minutes, 6–8 weeks after SG. The trial is quadruple‑blinded: participants, care providers, investigators, and outcomes assessors are unaware of treatment assignment.\n\nAll participants undergo baseline assessments within 6 weeks before surgery and repeat assessments at 9 ± 1 months postoperatively. Baseline and follow‑up measures include dual energy X‑ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans of the total body, total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine to determine areal BMD and body composition (fat mass, lean mass, appendicular lean mass). Participants are classified as osteopenic or osteoporotic according to WHO criteria. Quantitative CT (QCT) scans of the lumbar spine (L1–L5) are performed at both time points using a standardized protocol with a calibration phantom to assess volumetric BMD, and subject‑specific finite element models of the L2 vertebra are generated to estimate vertebral strength and fracture risk.\n\nFunctional and patient‑reported outcome measures include the Human Activity Profile, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and a calcium intake survey from the National Osteoporosis Foundation. Objective physical function tests comprise the 5 Times Sit to Stand test (lower extremity strength and function), handgrip strength (upper extremity strength), and the 4‑meter walk test (functional mobility and gait). Blood samples are collected at baseline and 9 months for bone turnover markers, including serum procollagen type 1 N‑terminal propeptide (P1NP, a formation marker) and urinary N‑telopeptide of type 1 collagen (NTX, a resorption marker), which are analyzed in batch using ELISA.\n\nTo minimize risk of hypocalcemia associated with zoledronic acid, all participants receive standardized supplementation beginning before surgery: 1200 mg of calcium daily and vitamin D dosed according to baseline 25‑hydroxyvitamin D levels (1000 IU daily if ≥30 ng/mL, 2000 IU daily if 20–29 ng/mL). ProCare bariatric multivitamins are supplied, and supplementation is continued throughout the study. Kidney function is assessed immediately prior to infusion via a comprehensive metabolic panel; participants must have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥35 mL/min to receive the infusion. Those with lower eGFR are not infused and may be withdrawn per endocrinologist review. Participants are monitored during and after infusion for acute adverse events, with vital signs recorded and side effect questionnaires administered immediately after, and again by telephone at 24 hours and 2 months post‑infusion.\n\nThe primary outcome is the change in total hip areal BMD (g/cm²) over 9 months following SG. Secondary outcomes include changes in femoral neck and lumbar spine (L1–L4) aBMD by DXA, lumbar spine volumetric BMD by QCT, vertebral strength from finite element analysis, bone turnover markers (P1NP and NTX), body composition, physical function measures, and patient‑reported outcomes. Feasibility is evaluated by tracking adverse events, side effects, and compliance with visits and supplementation.\n\nStatistical analyses are planned primarily for hypothesis generation and feasibility rather than confirmatory inference. A sample size of 10 participants per group yields 80% power to detect a between‑group difference of 0.11 g/cm² in total hip BMD using a two‑sided Wilcoxon test, assuming an SD of 0.07 g/cm². Similarly, within‑group changes of 0.07 g/cm² can be detected with adequate power. To account for an anticipated 33% attrition, 15 participants per group (30 total) will be recruited. Baseline characteristics will be summarized and compared between groups. The primary analysis uses a linear mixed model with total hip aBMD at 9 months as the outcome, including treatment group, sex, and menopausal status as independent variables, and contrasts to compare changes over 9 months at an alpha level of 0.05. No adjustments for multiple comparisons are planned.\n\nThe study is approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Nebraska Medical Center and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04279392). It is designed to generate preliminary data on the efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid in preventing SG‑associated bone loss and to assess the feasibility of a larger, definitive trial in this

Forty subjects (10 healthy and 30 with different patterns of venous disease: superficial insufficiency, deep insufficiency, or deep obstruction) used bilateral NMES devices for 4–6 hours per day, 5 days a week, over 6 weeks. The main hypothesis was that repeated NMES use would enhance venous haemodynamics, reduce oedema, and improve disease severity and patient-reported quality of life, especially in those with more severe venous disease."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This controlled interventional trial (VeINS Trial; NCT02137499) investigated the haemodynamic and clinical effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) in healthy subjects and patients with chronic venous disease (CVD). CVD arises from impaired venous return due to superficial or deep venous insufficiency or obstruction, leading to venous hypertension, leg swelling, symptoms, and complications such as venous ulcers. Existing treatments (surgery, compression hosiery, layered bandaging, intermittent pneumatic compression) primarily aim to reduce venous stasis and improve venous return.\n\nThe study used the geko™ T‑1 NMES device (Firstkind Ltd, UK), which delivers intermittent transcutaneous electrical stimulation (27 mA, 1 Hz, adjustable pulse width 70–560 μs) to the common peroneal nerve at the knee. This elicits contractions of the anterior and lateral leg muscles to activate the calf muscle pump while the subject is at rest. There was no pre‑existing treatment protocol for venous disease, so the investigators specified a pragmatic regimen: bilateral application of the device for 4–6 hours per day, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks. Subjects were trained to self‑apply and adjust the device, and completed usage diaries.\n\nForty adults (>18 years) were recruited: 10 healthy volunteers and 30 patients with venous disease. Venous patients were stratified according to duplex ultrasound findings into superficial venous insufficiency, deep venous insufficiency, or deep venous obstruction, recognizing that some had mixed patterns. Exclusion criteria included peripheral arterial disease, leg fracture or metallic implants, and systemic causes of limb swelling (heart, lung, or renal failure). Baseline assessments included medical history, physical examination, pregnancy testing in women, ankle–brachial pressure index, and detailed venous duplex ultrasound with reflux defined as >0.5 s. Disease severity was classified using CEAP clinical class.\n\nThe primary physiological outcomes were femoral vein haemodynamic parameters and microcirculatory flow. Venous peak velocity (PV), time‑averaged mean velocity (TAMV), and volume flow (VF) were measured by duplex ultrasound in the right femoral vein 3–5 cm from the saphenofemoral junction. Laser Doppler fluximetry was recorded from the dorsum of the left hand and foot to assess changes in microvascular flux. Measurements were taken after a 10‑minute rest, with the NMES device off, and then 20 minutes after device activation at a comfortable stimulation setting. Haemodynamic testing was repeated at week 6 following the 6‑week NMES usage period.\n\nLeg volume was estimated bilaterally using circumferential measurements at the ankle and maximal calf, along with the vertical distance between them, and applying a truncated inverted cone model to calculate volume. This allowed evaluation of changes in leg oedema over the 6‑week treatment period.\n\nClinical and patient‑reported outcomes included the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS), Venous Disability Score (VDS), Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ), EuroQol‑5D (EQ‑5D), Short Form‑12 (SF‑12), and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES‑D). These were collected at baseline (week 0), after treatment (week 6), and two weeks after stopping NMES (week 8) to assess durability of effect. Patients were also grouped by CEAP class into mild disease (C0–3) and severe disease (C4–6) for analysis of quality‑of‑life changes.\n\nAnalyses compared demographic and baseline characteristics across groups with ANOVA, and haemodynamic parameters as changes from baseline between healthy subjects and pooled venous patients, as well as between venous subgroups. Normality was tested with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test; appropriate parametric or non‑parametric tests were then applied, with significance at p<0.05.\n\nResults showed that NMES acutely increased femoral peak velocity, TAMV, and volume flow in patients with venous disease, with gains generally smaller in deep venous disease and obstruction. Regular use over 6 weeks further enhanced PV and TAMV in both healthy and diseased subjects. Laser Doppler fluximetry increased markedly in the leg and arm, indicating improved microcirculatory flow, although leg responses were attenuated in deep venous disease. Over 6 weeks, unilateral leg volume decreased by approximately 12% in venous patients, indicating a clinically meaningful reduction in oedema, whereas healthy participants showed minimal change.\n\nQuality‑of‑life and clinical severity scores tended to improve among patients with venous pathology, particularly those with severe disease (CEAP C4–6), with reductions in VDS and AVVQ scores and improvements in SF‑12. The only statistically significant change was an improvement in VDS from week 0 to week 6, but several changes were considered clinically relevant. Improvements in venous clinical scores persisted two weeks after stopping NMES.\n\nAbout 23% of subjects, all with severe venous disease and higher BMI, did not exhibit a visible muscle twitch at maximum device output, limiting treatment effectiveness in these individuals. Devices were generally well tolerated; some participants experienced skin irritation at the application site, which resolved with cessation and topical emollients.\n\nIn summary, the study demonstrates that NMES via a portable peroneal nerve stimulator can acutely and chronically improve venous haemodynamics, reduce leg oedema, and potentially improve quality of life in patients with chronic venous disease. The therapy may be useful as an adjunctive measure in chronic venous insufficiency and may have a role in venous thromboembolism prophylaxis where anticoagulation or compression is limited, though thrombosis outcomes were not directly assessed in this trial.""}","{""conditions"": [""Chronic Venous Insufficiency"", ""Varicose Veins"", ""Venous Thromboembolism"", ""Deep Vein Thrombosis"", ""Venous Ulcer"", ""Edema"", ""Venous Insufficiency, Deep"", ""Venous Obstruction""], ""keywords"": [""Chronic Venous Disease"", ""Superficial Venous Insufficiency"", ""Deep Venous Insufficiency"", ""Deep Venous Obstruction"", ""Varicose Veins"", ""Venous Hypertension"", ""Leg Edema"", ""Venous Ulcer"", ""Venous Thromboembolism"", ""Deep Vein Thrombosis"", ""Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation"", ""NMES"", ""geko device"", ""Venous Hemodynamics"", ""Femoral Vein Flow"", ""Laser Doppler Fluximetry"", ""Calf Muscle Pump"", ""Intermittent Pneumatic Compression"", ""Quality of Life"", ""Venous Clinical Severity Score"", ""Venous Disability Score"", ""Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""NON_RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Controlled interventional feasibility trial with four predefined groups (healthy, superficial venous insufficiency, deep venous insufficiency, deep venous obstruction) all receiving the same NMES intervention and compared across groups."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": ""COHORT"", ""timePerspective"": ""PROSPECTIVE"", ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Open-label study; no mention of blinding of participants, care providers, investigators, or outcomes assessors."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 40, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Healthy subjects"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""Adults without chronic venous disease.

The primary goals were to evaluate overall survival and progression-free survival; secondary objectives included objective response rate and safety. Enrollment was stopped early after results from the global KEYNOTE-061 trial showed no significant overall survival benefit for pembrolizumab over paclitaxel. In this smaller Asian cohort, overall survival was similar between groups, progression-free survival favored paclitaxel, and pembrolizumab showed fewer treatment-related adverse events, indicating a favorable tolerability profile but inconclusive efficacy due to limited statistical power."", ""detailedDescription"": ""KEYNOTE-063 (NCT03019588) was a randomized, open-label, phase 3 study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab versus paclitaxel as second-line therapy in Asian patients with advanced PD-L1–positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. The trial was conducted at 36 medical centers across China (mainland), Malaysia, South Korea, and Taiwan.\n\nEligible participants were adults (≥18 years) with histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma, measurable disease per RECIST v1.1, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 0 or 1, and tumor PD-L1 expression with a combined positive score (CPS) ≥1 assessed centrally using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay. Patients had to have documented disease progression during or after first-line treatment with any platinum/fluoropyrimidine doublet. Those with HER2-positive tumors were required to have progressed on trastuzumab-containing therapy; HER2 status could be determined locally when unknown.\n\nPatients were randomized 1:1, stratified by time to progression on first-line therapy (<6 vs ≥6 months) and ECOG PS (0 vs 1), to one of two treatment arms: pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles (approximately 2 years) or paclitaxel 80 mg/m² intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 4-week cycle. Treatment was continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, investigator decision, or withdrawal of consent. Tumor imaging was performed every 6 weeks and assessed by blinded independent central review according to RECIST v1.1.\n\nThe dual primary endpoints were overall survival (OS), defined as time from randomization to death from any cause, and progression-free survival (PFS), defined as time from randomization to radiographic disease progression or death. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1, duration of response (DOR; exploratory), and safety/tolerability. Efficacy was analyzed in the intention-to-treat population; safety was evaluated in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. Time-to-event outcomes were estimated using Kaplan–Meier methods, and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained from stratified Cox proportional hazards models.\n\nThe original sample size was 360 patients, which was expected to provide approximately 91% power to detect superiority of pembrolizumab over paclitaxel for OS at a one-sided alpha of 0.0215, assuming an underlying OS hazard ratio of 0.67 and 290 OS events. However, after the global phase 3 KEYNOTE-061 trial demonstrated that pembrolizumab did not significantly improve OS compared with paclitaxel as second-line therapy in a broader population with PD-L1 CPS ≥1 gastric/GEJ cancer, screening and enrollment in KEYNOTE-063 were halted on March 12, 2018. As a result, only 94 patients were enrolled (47 per arm), and the study was underpowered for its planned efficacy comparisons.\n\nWith a median follow-up of 24 months from randomization to data cutoff (October 8, 2019), 83 of 94 patients had died. Median OS was 8 months (95% CI, 4–10) in the pembrolizumab group and 8 months (95% CI, 5–11) in the paclitaxel group (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.63–1.54), indicating no apparent difference in survival. Median PFS was 2 months (95% CI, 1–3) for pembrolizumab and 4 months (95% CI, 3–6) for paclitaxel (HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.04–2.52), favoring paclitaxel. Confirmed ORR was 13% with pembrolizumab and 19% with paclitaxel; complete responses occurred in 4% and 6% of patients, respectively. Median DOR was 8 months (range, 3–20+ months) in the pembrolizumab arm and 12 months (range, 2–17+ months) in the paclitaxel arm, with four patients in each group achieving responses lasting at least 6 months.\n\nSafety findings showed a more favorable toxicity profile for pembrolizumab compared with paclitaxel. Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) of any grade occurred in 60% of pembrolizumab-treated patients versus 96% of paclitaxel-treated patients. Grade 3–5 treatment-related AEs were reported in 11% versus 64% of patients, respectively. Common treatment-related AEs with pembrolizumab included fatigue and hypothyroidism, whereas paclitaxel was associated with typical cytotoxic toxicities such as alopecia, neutropenia, leukopenia, decreased appetite, anemia, fatigue, nausea, transaminase elevations, and peripheral neuropathy. Treatment-related AEs led to treatment discontinuation in 2% of pembrolizumab-treated patients and 14% of paclitaxel-treated patients. Treatment-related deaths occurred only in the paclitaxel arm (5%), due to pneumonia. Immune-mediated AEs and infusion reactions were observed in 19% of pembrolizumab-treated patients, mainly thyroid dysfunction, pneumonitis, adrenal insufficiency, and hypersensitivity, consistent with known immune checkpoint inhibitor toxicity profiles.\n\nThe investigators noted that baseline characteristics in KEYNOTE-063 were generally similar to those of the PD-L1 CPS ≥1 population in the global KEYNOTE-061 trial but with some differences in functional status, tumor site, histology, and previous surgery in this Asian cohort. They concluded that, due to early termination and limited sample size, definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy of second-line pembrolizumab in Asian patients with advanced PD-L1–positive gastric/GEJ cancer cannot be drawn. Nonetheless, pembrolizumab was well tolerated and showed a safety profile consistent with prior studies. Overall, the patterns of efficacy and safety in KEYNOTE-063 were similar to those observed in the larger global KEYNOTE-061 trial. The authors emphasized the continued need to define the optimal role and timing of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment continuum for advanced gastric/GEJ cancer, particularly as these agents move into first-line combination regimens.""}","{""conditions"": [""Gastric Neoplasms"", ""Stomach Neoplasms"", ""Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma"", ""Gastric Adenocarcinoma"", ""Advanced Gastric Cancer"", ""Metastatic Gastric Cancer""], ""keywords"": [""Gastric Cancer"", ""Stomach Cancer"", ""Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer"", ""Gastric Adenocarcinoma"", ""Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma"", ""PD-1 Inhibitors"", ""Pembrolizumab"", ""Paclitaxel"", ""Programmed Death-Ligand 1"", ""PD-L1 Combined Positive Score"", ""CPS ≥1"", ""Second-Line Therapy"", ""Advanced Gastric/GEJ Cancer"", ""Metastatic Gastric Cancer"", ""Unresectable Gastric Cancer"", ""Immunotherapy"", ""Checkpoint Inhibitors""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE3""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Two-arm, randomized, open-label comparison of pembrolizumab versus paclitaxel as second-line therapy in Asian patients with advanced PD-L1–positive gastric/GEJ cancer."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Open-label study;

One hundred eighty‑two women (BMI 25–48 kg/m², without diabetes) were randomized 3:2 to exenatide or to dietary counseling with placebo injections for up to 52 weeks. Participants who lost at least 5% of their body weight by 12 weeks were classified as high responders and continued, while those achieving at least 10% loss at any time were classified as super responders. The main goal was to compare longer‑term weight change among early high responders in each group, and to identify clinical and metabolomic factors associated with greater weight loss. The study found that, among early responders, longer‑term weight loss with exenatide was similar to that achieved with a hypocaloric diet, and that greater early weight loss predicted later \""super responder\"" status in both groups."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This study was a 52‑week, single‑blind, randomized interventional trial designed to characterize weight loss responses to twice‑daily exenatide versus a hypocaloric diet with matched placebo injections in women with overweight or obesity but without diabetes. The primary objective was to assess long‑term changes in body weight among individuals who demonstrated an early robust weight loss (high responders) with either treatment. Secondary objectives included evaluation of changes in metabolic parameters (waist circumference, lipid profile, resting energy expenditure, body composition, and thermic effect of food) and exploratory analysis of metabolomic predictors of treatment response.\n\nA total of 249 women were screened and 182 enrolled. Eligible participants were 18–70 years old with BMI 25.0–48 kg/m², without acute or poorly controlled chronic disease, and without diabetes, prior exenatide use, or history of pancreatitis. Participants were randomized 3:2 to exenatide (n=127) or to hypocaloric diet plus placebo injections (n=55). Exenatide was administered as self‑injected subcutaneous doses titrated to a maximum of 10 µg twice daily; the control group received matched placebo injections plus structured nutrition counseling with a prescribed ~500 kcal/day deficit based on measured resting metabolic rate. Both groups were instructed to maintain their usual physical activity; only the diet group received ongoing dietary counseling. Neither group received specific exercise counseling beyond maintaining current routines.\n\nStudy visits occurred every 2 weeks during the first month and every 4 weeks thereafter. Participants were included in the main analysis if they completed at least 12 weeks of treatment (exenatide n=75, diet n=33). At 12 weeks, women in either arm who had lost ≥5% of their baseline body weight were classified as high responders and continued in the study up to 52 weeks; those who did not meet this threshold were classified as low responders and were discontinued per protocol. Participants in either arm who lost ≥10% of baseline weight at any time were categorized as super responders.\n\nAt each visit, blinded study staff measured body weight, waist circumference, vital signs, and body composition using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Comprehensive metabolic evaluations were performed at baseline and at weeks 12, 24, and 52, including fasting blood tests (hematology, electrolytes, lipids), resting metabolic rate via indirect calorimetry, and thermic effect of food (TEF) using a standardized liquid meal. Serial postprandial triglyceride and insulin levels were measured following the test meal.\n\nAn exploratory targeted metabolomics sub‑study used LC‑MS to quantify ~150 endogenous polar metabolites and acylcarnitines in baseline fasting plasma samples from exenatide high and low responders and from diet responders. Metabolite peak intensities were log‑transformed, quality‑controlled by coefficients of variation, and analyzed using nonparametric statistics to compare responders vs non‑responders and super responders vs responders in each treatment arm.\n\nThe trial found substantial inter‑individual variability in weight loss trajectories in both treatment arms. After 12 weeks, 56% of exenatide‑treated and 76% of diet/placebo participants were high responders. Peak absolute and percentage weight loss were similar between exenatide and diet high responders, but the diet group exhibited a wider range of maximum weight loss and a numerically higher proportion of super responders (23% exenatide vs 36% diet, not statistically significant). In both arms, greater early weight loss (at 3 months) predicted super responder status, while baseline age, BMI, weight, waist circumference, total cholesterol, and resting energy expenditure did not reliably predict high responder status. Both groups showed significant reductions in waist circumference, resting energy expenditure, and triglycerides among high responders, with additional improvements in insulin, systolic blood pressure, and percent body fat confined to diet high responders. Exenatide high and low responders both showed reductions in total and LDL cholesterol, suggesting potential lipid effects beyond weight loss alone.\n\nExenatide treatment, but not diet, led to a significant reduction in thermic effect of food over 12 weeks in both high and low responders, consistent with known GLP‑1 receptor agonist effects such as delayed gastric emptying. Despite similar total weight loss among early responders, diet responders tended to show less weight regain and more pronounced improvements in some metabolic parameters, possibly reflecting durable lifestyle changes.\n\nThe metabolomics analysis indicated that lower baseline cysteine levels were associated with subsequent weight loss response to exenatide. Compared with diet responders, exenatide responders had higher baseline glucose, caffeine, and C6 acylcarnitine. Within treatment arms, diet high responders had higher baseline niacinamide, anthranilic acid, and glycerol, whereas exenatide high responders and super responders tended to have higher levels of metabolites such as anandamide, sarcosine, aminoisobutyric acid, serotonin, and certain acylcarnitines, suggesting potential biologic pathways linked to appetite and energy metabolism. These metabolomic findings are exploratory and limited by small sample size.\n\nCommon adverse events included nausea, decreased appetite, and headache, with nausea and appetite suppression more frequent in the exenatide group. Dropout rates by week 12 were about 40% in both arms, primarily occurring early after randomization, but were lower after 12 weeks among continuing responders.\n\nOverall, in women with overweight or obesity who achieved early robust weight loss, prolonged exenatide therapy produced weight loss outcomes comparable to those achieved with a hypocaloric diet plus placebo injections. The magnitude of early weight loss was a key predictor of achieving ≥10% long‑term weight loss for both exenatide and diet. The results suggest that while exenatide has specific metabolic effects, including on lipids and TEF, its net weight loss effect in early responders resembles that of structured dietary energy restriction in this population. Larger and more diverse studies are needed to clarify predictors of response and patterns of weight regain with GLP‑1 receptor agonists versus lifestyle interventions.""}","{""conditions"": [""Overweight"", ""Obesity"", ""Weight Loss"", ""Body Weight Changes""], ""keywords"": [""Exenatide"", ""Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 Receptor Agonists"", ""GLP-1 receptor agonist"", ""Hypocaloric Diet"", ""Weight Reduction Programs"", ""Weight Loss Maintenance"", ""Resting Energy Expenditure"", ""Thermic Effect of Food"", ""Body Composition"", ""Waist Circumference"", ""Cholesterol"", ""Triglycerides"", ""Insulin"", ""Metabolomics"", ""Cysteine"", ""Anandamide"", ""Aminoisobutyric Acid"", ""Sarcosine"", ""Serotonin"", ""Women"", ""Overweight and Obese Women"", ""Randomized Controlled Trial""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Single-blind, 52-week, randomized 3:2 parallel-group trial of twice-daily exenatide versus matched placebo injections plus hypocaloric diet in overweight and obese women."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""SINGLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Single-blind design in which all subjects were blinded to study treatment (exenatide vs matched placebo injections plus hypocaloric diet)."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 182, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Exenatide"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Overweight and obese women were randomized to receive twice daily subcutaneous exenatide injections, titrated to a maximum dose of 10 mcg per injection, for up to 52 weeks.

The main goal is to see if the reinforcement learning text messaging program increases average medication adherence over 6 months. The study also examines whether this approach improves blood sugar control, measured by HbA1c, and self‑reported adherence, and explores how such a system could be scaled to support other long‑term self‑management behaviors."", ""detailedDescription"": ""The REinforcement learning to Improve Non-adherence For diabetes treatments by Optimising Response and Customising Engagement (REINFORCE) trial is a two-arm pragmatic randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the impact of a reinforcement learning–based text messaging intervention on medication adherence among adults with type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe study is conducted at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), Boston, USA, within the Mass General Brigham system. Eligible participants are 18–84 years old with diagnosed type 2 diabetes, prescribed 1–3 daily oral diabetes medications, and with a most recent HbA1c ≥7.5%, indicating suboptimal glycemic control. Participants must have a smartphone with data or home Wi‑Fi and ability to receive text messages, be able to use electronic pill bottles in place of their usual pill containers, have basic English proficiency, and be independently responsible for taking their medications. Patients using insulin are eligible, but prior documented non-adherence is not required.\n\nAfter screening through the electronic health record and clinician approval, potentially eligible patients are invited by mail or electronic portal and then contacted by phone. Consented participants complete a baseline questionnaire via REDCap and are mailed Pillsy electronic pill bottles for their eligible oral diabetes medications. Adherence data are passively transmitted through a background smartphone app.\n\nParticipants are randomized 1:1 to the intervention or control arm, with block randomization based on baseline self-reported adherence (<1 vs ≥1 doses missed in the last 30 days) and baseline HbA1c (<9.0% vs ≥9.0%). All patients use electronic pill bottles for 6 months. The primary outcome is average medication adherence over the 6-month follow-up, calculated by averaging daily adherence (number of valid bottle openings divided by prescribed daily doses, capped at one opening per ~3 hours to avoid overcounting) across all study medications. Secondary outcomes include change in glycemic control (HbA1c) using routine EHR laboratory data near the 6‑month endpoint, and self-reported adherence at follow-up using a validated three-item scale.\n\nThe intervention arm receives a reinforcement learning–driven text messaging program designed to support medication-taking. Beginning the morning after randomization, a machine learning system (Microsoft Personalizer hosted on a HIPAA-compliant Microsoft Azure server) selects which message content is most likely to promote that patient’s medication-taking that day, based on prior daily adherence data from the pill bottles and patient characteristics (e.g., age, sex, number of medications, baseline HbA1c, and patient activation). Adherence from the prior day is treated as a continuous reward (0–1) for the algorithm, which applies a contextual bandit approach with Boltzmann sampling. The model also incorporates the recency of different message factor types and whether the patient took their dose “early” (before that morning’s prediction) and maintains some exploration (10% of daily predictions are random) to continue learning. If bottle data are temporarily unavailable, messages are generated from available history; reward events are withheld when bottles are obviously disconnected and assigned a default reward of 0 if still missing after 2 days.\n\nThe text messages are grounded in behavioral science and vary along five factor dimensions: (1) framing (neutral, positive, negative), (2) observed feedback (e.g., number of days adherent in the prior week), (3) social reinforcement (including references to loved ones), (4) content type (simple reminder vs information about medications or lifestyle), and (5) reflection (messages that prompt introspection or a reflective question). A library of 128 messages comprising 47 unique combinations of these factors was developed using prior trial experience, behavioral theory, and qualitative patient interviews. The reinforcement learning system chooses among these factor sets (and specific messages within them) and can also decide not to send a message on a given day. Messages are sent up to daily via Microsoft Dynamics 365 SMS Texting, a HIPAA-compliant platform. Two-way texting is technically possible, including allowing patients to stop reminders, but responses are not encouraged to preserve scalability.\n\nIn addition to algorithm-selected messages, intervention participants receive a standard introductory text at randomization, periodic texts prompting synchronization if their pill bottles are disconnected for over 7 days (repeated every 3 days up to 30 days), and an end-of-study text with a link to the follow-up questionnaire. If synchronization gaps exceed 14 and 28 days, study staff make one phone call at each time point. Control participants receive the same introductory, synchronization, and end-of-study texts and support calls but do not receive any reinforcement learning–driven adherence messages.\n\nThe primary analysis will use an intention-to-treat approach. Adherence and HbA1c outcomes will be modeled using generalized estimating equations with an identity link and normally distributed errors, adjusting for the block randomization. Missing HbA1c data (anticipated up to ~25%) will be addressed with multiple imputation if more than 10% of values are missing, with complete case analyses as a secondary approach. Self-reported adherence (proportion adherent) will be analyzed using Poisson models with a log link to estimate relative risks. Sensitivity analyses will include censoring participants who stop using their pill bottles for more than 30 days, assessing change in HbA1c from baseline, and examining each self-report adherence item separately. Planned subgroup analyses stratify by age, sex, race/ethnicity, baseline HbA1c, baseline self-reported adherence, and number of diabetes medications.\n\nThe sample size of 60 participants provides 80% power (α=0.05) to detect an absolute 10% difference in average adherence (assuming SD=12.5%), an HbA1c difference of 1.0% (assuming SD=1.3), and a 50% relative difference in self-reported adherence between arms.\n\nUpon trial completion, exploratory analyses will cluster intervention participants based on their response patterns to different message factor combinations. Baseline characteristics and additional post-hoc message features (e.g., quantitative content, explicit reference to the doctor, lifestyle content) will be used to predict cluster membership, with the aim of informing more accurate initial personalization strategies for future interventions.\n\nThe trial is approved by the Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04473326). Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and reporting to ClinicalTrials.gov and the funder. The overarching hypothesis is that a reinforcement learning–based, individually tailored text messaging program will improve medication adherence and glycemic control in type 2 diabetes compared with control, and that the approach will be scalable and adaptable to other self-management behaviors.""}","{""conditions"": [""Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus"", ""Medication Adherence"", ""Glycemic Control""], ""keywords"": [""Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus"", ""Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"", ""Medication Adherence"", ""Patient Compliance"", ""Self-Management"", ""Reinforcement Learning"", ""Machine Learning"", ""Text Messaging"", ""mHealth"", ""Telemedicine"", ""Electronic Medication Monitoring"", ""Electronic Pill Bottles"", ""Hemoglobin A1c"", ""Glycated Hemoglobin"", ""Behavioral Intervention"", ""Pragmatic Clinical Trial""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Two-arm pragmatic randomised controlled trial with participants allocated 1:1 to a reinforcement learning–based text messaging programme versus control (no messaging beyond basic operational texts), analyzed over 6 months of follow-up."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""SINGLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Data analysts at the end of the study will be blinded to arm assignment; patients are not blinded due to the nature of the text messaging intervention."", ""whoMasked"": [""OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 60, ""type"": ""ESTIMATED""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Reinforcement learning text messaging programme"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Patients receive electronic pill bottles for their eligible oral diabetes medications plus a reinforcement learning-based text messaging programme for 6 months.

The primary endpoint was progression‑free survival. The study found that adding ipatasertib did not improve progression‑free survival or response rate compared with paclitaxel alone, while increasing some toxicities such as diarrhea, and the combination’s safety profile was consistent with known effects of each agent."", ""detailedDescription"": ""IPATunity130 Cohort B is a component of a multicohort, phase 3 clinical trial investigating AKT inhibition in breast cancer. Cohort B specifically enrolled patients with hormone receptor‑positive (HR+, defined as ≥1% staining), HER2‑negative unresectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose tumors had activating alterations in PIK3CA and/or AKT1 and/or inactivating alterations in PTEN, as determined by a Foundation Medicine next‑generation sequencing Clinical Trial Assay. Patients had to be considered inappropriate for endocrine‑based therapy because of endocrine therapy insensitivity (primary or secondary endocrine resistance) or visceral crisis, and they had to be candidates for taxane monotherapy with an ECOG performance status of 0–1. Prior chemotherapy for advanced disease and relapse within 1 year of completion of (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy were exclusionary, as were known or suspected brain or spinal cord metastases. Prior treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors was allowed.\n\nPatients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either ipatasertib or placebo in combination with paclitaxel. Ipatasertib was administered orally at 400 mg once daily on days 1–21 of each 28‑day cycle; paclitaxel was given intravenously at 80 mg/m² on days 1, 8 and 15 of each cycle. Randomization was stratified by prior (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy, prior PI3K/mTOR inhibitor use, and geographic region. To address the known risk of diarrhea associated with ipatasertib and paclitaxel, loperamide prophylaxis was mandated during the first cycle where permitted. Treatment continued until disease progression per RECIST v1.1, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal; patients could continue single‑agent ipatasertib/placebo or paclitaxel if the other drug was discontinued. Crossover from placebo to ipatasertib was not allowed.\n\nThe primary endpoint was investigator‑assessed progression‑free survival (PFS), defined as the time from randomization to disease progression by RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause. A sensitivity analysis of PFS was performed using assessment by an independent review committee. Key secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), confirmed objective response rate (ORR), duration of response, clinical benefit rate (complete or partial response or stable disease ≥24 weeks), patient‑reported outcomes using the EORTC QLQ‑C30, and safety and tolerability, including the incidence and severity of adverse events graded by CTCAE v4.0.\n\nA total of 222 patients were randomized: 146 to ipatasertib plus paclitaxel and 76 to placebo plus paclitaxel. Baseline characteristics, including prior systemic therapies (such as CDK4/6 and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors), distribution of metastatic sites, and endocrine resistance patterns, were generally balanced. Most patients had visceral disease, and a substantial proportion had either primary or secondary endocrine resistance by ESMO criteria; another subset had visceral crisis without meeting formal endocrine resistance definitions.\n\nAt a median follow‑up of 12.9 months, the trial did not demonstrate an efficacy benefit for the addition of ipatasertib. Median investigator‑assessed PFS was 9.3 months in both arms (hazard ratio 1.00, 95% CI 0.71–1.40), and independent review committee‑assessed PFS was consistent with these results. Objective response rates among patients with measurable disease were 47% in each arm, with similar median durations of response and clinical benefit rates. OS data were immature at the time of reporting; median OS was not reached in the ipatasertib arm and was 20.9 months in the placebo arm, with a hazard ratio of 0.72 (95% CI 0.42–1.24) that did not meet criteria for statistical significance.\n\nPatient‑reported global health status/quality of life scores were maintained during treatment in both arms, with no clinically meaningful decline observed up to approximately 10 treatment cycles. Time to confirmed clinically meaningful deterioration in pain, measured by the EORTC QLQ‑C30 pain scale, did not differ significantly, though Kaplan–Meier curves suggested a modest, non‑significant advantage for the control arm.\n\nThe safety profile reflected the known toxicities of ipatasertib and paclitaxel. Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred more frequently with ipatasertib plus paclitaxel (55%) than with placebo plus paclitaxel (47%). Diarrhea, a recognized class effect of AKT inhibition, was substantially more common with ipatasertib (all‑grade 85%, grade 3 in 12%) compared with placebo (37% all‑grade, 1% grade 3). Other frequent toxicities included alopecia, nausea, vomiting, anemia, peripheral neuropathy, neutropenia, hepatic enzyme elevations, and hyperglycemia, with generally higher gastrointestinal and neuropathic toxicity in the ipatasertib arm. Serious adverse events were also more common with ipatasertib, and there were two treatment‑related deaths across the study (one febrile neutropenia in the ipatasertib arm and one sepsis in the paclitaxel‑alone arm). Paclitaxel exposure (duration and cumulative dose) was lower in the ipatasertib arm, partly due to toxicity‑related discontinuations, which may have impacted the ability to isolate any contribution of ipatasertib to efficacy.\n\nOverall, IPATunity130 Cohort B showed that adding the AKT inhibitor ipatasertib to paclitaxel did not improve progression‑free survival, objective response, or early overall survival in patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN‑altered HR+ HER2‑negative advanced breast cancer who were not suitable for further endocrine therapy. The regimen was tolerable with proactive management of diarrhea but associated with higher rates of gastrointestinal and neuropathic adverse events. In the broader context of PI3K/AKT pathway targeting in HR+ HER2‑negative breast cancer, the findings contrast with trials where PI3K or AKT inhibitors are combined with endocrine therapy, such as SOLAR‑1 and FAKTION, which demonstrated PFS benefits. The authors suggest that effective endocrine receptor blockade may be necessary to realize the therapeutic potential of AKT inhibition in this disease setting, and ongoing studies are focusing on combinations of ipatasertib with endocrine and/or immunotherapies.""}","{""conditions"": [""Breast Neoplasms"", ""Breast Neoplasms, Hormone Receptor-Positive"", ""Breast Neoplasms, HER2-Negative"", ""Advanced Breast Neoplasms"", ""Metastatic Breast Neoplasms""], ""keywords"": [""Hormone receptor-positive breast cancer"", ""HR-positive breast cancer"", ""HER2-negative breast cancer"", ""Advanced breast cancer"", ""Metastatic breast cancer"", ""PIK3CA mutation"", ""AKT1 mutation"", ""PTEN alteration"", ""PI3K/AKT pathway"", ""AKT inhibitor"", ""Ipatasertib"", ""Paclitaxel"", ""Endocrine resistance"", ""Visceral crisis""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""PHASE3""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Two-arm, parallel-group trial with patients randomized 2:1 to ipatasertib plus paclitaxel versus placebo plus paclitaxel."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Double-blind, placebo-controlled design in which both patients and investigators were blinded to ipatasertib versus placebo assignment."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT"", ""CARE_PROVIDER"", ""INVESTIGATOR"", ""OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 222, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Ipatasertib plus paclitaxel"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Patients received oral ipatasertib 400 mg once daily on days 1–21 of each 28-day cycle plus intravenous paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle, continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal."", ""interventionNames"": [""Ipatasertib"", ""Paclitaxel""]}, {""label"": ""Placebo plus paclitaxel"", ""type"": ""PLACEBO_COMPARATOR"", ""description"": ""Patients received oral placebo once daily on days 1–21 of each 28-day cycle plus intravenous paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle, continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal."", ""interventionNames"": [""Placebo"", ""Paclitaxel""]}], ""interventions"": [{""type"": ""DRUG"", ""name"": ""Ipatasertib"", ""description"": ""Ipatasertib is an oral ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitor of all three AKT isoforms.

Building on prior work using video‑recorded peer storytelling, the investigators transform key quotations from five African American Veteran storytellers into brief narrative SMS messages. These narrative texts are combined with educational and interactive (two‑way) messages within the Veterans Affairs Annie texting platform, with the aim of reinforcing lifestyle changes, medication adherence, and other self‑management behaviors between clinic visits. Each texting protocol corresponds to one Veteran storyteller, allowing participants to select the story that best resonates with their own experiences. A randomized trial is underway to evaluate the effect of this intervention on lifestyle behaviors and blood pressure control."", ""detailedDescription"": ""The study focuses on extending the impact of an existing peer‑storytelling intervention for African American Veterans with hypertension by integrating story‑based content into a longitudinal mobile health (mHealth) texting program. Prior work showed that video narratives from African American Veterans improved emotional engagement and intentions to change hypertension‑related behaviors but did not produce sustained improvements in blood pressure after a one‑time viewing. To address this, the research team designed a series of structured text‑messaging protocols to 'continue the conversation' initiated by the videos.\n\nUsing the Department of Veterans Affairs Annie SMS texting platform, the team created five separate 6‑month protocols, each aligned with one of five previously recorded Veteran storytellers who had successfully managed uncontrolled hypertension. The protocol design was informed by Social Cognitive Theory, emphasizing self‑efficacy, behavioral capability, and reinforcement. The text content is organized around key hypertension self‑management domains (eg, medication taking, salt intake, physical activity, blood pressure monitoring, use of social support), which had been identified during the initial development of the video narratives.\n\nText messages fall into three categories: (1) narrative messages that incorporate quotations or paraphrased micro‑stories drawn from the storytellers’ transcripts; (2) educational messages that provide guideline‑based information from sources such as the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and (3) interactive two‑way messages that query patients about their self‑efficacy and performance of specific self‑management behaviors, using preset response formats. The interactive messages return tailored, automated feedback and often include links to additional resources, such as American Heart Association or VA educational webpages.\n\nTo create narrative texts, the team systematically reviewed full story transcripts, identified longer segments that expressed core self‑management concepts and narrative elements, and then distilled these into 160‑character SMS messages while striving to preserve each storyteller’s voice. Because the Annie system requires brevity and inclusion of an \""Annie\"" identifier in every message, considerable editing and iterative review were necessary. Some storytellers did not speak to every key content area; in such cases, narrative texts from other storytellers were used, with wording that clearly indicated they came from 'a Veteran who shared his story with us' rather than the participant’s selected storyteller.\n\nTwo African American Veteran consultants played a central role in refining both language and protocol structure. They advised on cultural sensitivity, appropriate tone, and how to convey authenticity without perpetuating stigma. For example, although early drafts attempted to mirror vernacular spellings (eg, 'hafta', 'gonna'), consultants recommended using standard spelling to avoid reinforcing negative stereotypes and to respect Veterans who may have experienced educational inequities or stigmatization related to speech patterns. Consultants also suggested structuring each 2‑week content block so that the first week emphasized educational texts (to 'see if they can do it themselves') and the second week reintroduced the storyteller’s voice through narrative messages to re‑engage participants.\n\nThe final 26‑week protocol is organized into nine key content area blocks, with two high‑priority topics (salt intake and medication taking) repeated because of their broad relevance and rich narrative content. Each 2‑week block includes eight messages spaced across 14 days and begins and ends with interactive texts that serve as 'bookends': the first assesses self‑efficacy related to that content area, while the second assesses recent behavior and offers additional VA resource suggestions. After every four content blocks (approximately every 8 weeks), an all‑interactive 'check‑in' week is inserted to reassess overall confidence in managing blood pressure and to prompt reflection on behaviors performed during that week.\n\nMessages are scheduled for delivery at 11 AM and 3 PM to accommodate Veterans working varied shifts, based on consultant feedback. The Annie platform’s constraints—such as fixed character limits, required inclusion of the word 'Annie', lack of open‑ended interactive responses, and non‑trivial customization of send times—shaped both message content and implementation strategy. The researchers collaborated with VA operational partners and experienced Annie users to optimize message design within these constraints.\n\nThe intervention is being piloted and then tested in a randomized controlled trial among African American Veterans with hypertension (Trial Registration: NCT03970590). Participants will view all five storyteller videos (now often delivered virtually, especially during the COVID‑19 pandemic), choose the storyteller with whom they most identify, and then be assigned to the corresponding 6‑month texting protocol. Outcomes of interest include changes in self‑efficacy, hypertension self‑management behaviors (such as medication adherence and diet), and blood pressure control. The overarching objective is to deliver a scalable, low‑cost, culturally sensitive mHealth intervention that addresses mistrust, supports long‑term behavior change, and helps reduce racial disparities in hypertension‑related morbidity and mortality among Veterans.""}","{""conditions"": [""Hypertension"", ""High Blood Pressure""], ""keywords"": [""Hypertension"", ""High Blood Pressure"", ""Blood Pressure Control"", ""Medication Adherence"", ""Self-Management"", ""African Americans"", ""Veterans"", ""Peer Narratives"", ""Storytelling"", ""Text Messaging"", ""Mobile Health"", ""mHealth"", ""Behavior Change"", ""Salt Intake"", ""Dietary Sodium Restriction"", ""Patient Engagement"", ""Self-Efficacy"", ""Social Cognitive Theory"", ""Veterans Affairs"", ""Annie Texting System""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Participants view peer storytelling videos, select a preferred storyteller, and are then randomized in a trial (described as underway) to receive or not receive a 6‑month Annie-based text-messaging protocol linked to that storyteller to support hypertension self-management."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""The article describes development of the intervention and notes a randomized trial is underway, but provides no information about any blinding; given the nature of an SMS-based behavioral intervention, masking of participants and providers is unlikely and not reported."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": null, ""type"": null}, ""targetDuration"": null}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Storytelling Video Plus Narrative Text-Messaging Protocol"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""Participants view five 5–8 minute video-recorded hypertension self-management stories told by African American Veterans, then select a preferred storyteller.

Each participant completes three 20‑minute sessions in random order: an immersive VR ocean-reef experience, a non‑immersive tablet-based version of the same content, and a VR headset with no content (sensory deprivation control). Pain intensity and unpleasantness, anxiety, physiological pain-related measures (such as heart rate, respiratory rate, pupillometry, and heart rate variability), and subjective experience are measured before and after each session. The main hypothesis is that immersive VR will reduce pain more than the control conditions and will be safe and tolerable in this acute trauma population."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This study addresses the need for effective non-pharmacological analgesic strategies to help reduce opioid use in the acute care setting, particularly among patients with traumatic injuries and traumatic brain injury (TBI), who are at high risk for persistent opioid use and opioid use disorder. Virtual reality (VR) has shown promise as an adjunctive pain therapy in other medical contexts, but its safety, feasibility, and efficacy in patients with acute traumatic injuries, especially those with TBI, are not well established.\n\nThe trial is designed as a randomized, within-subject, crossover clinical study conducted at the R. Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore, Maryland. Sixty adult inpatients with traumatic injuries (including mild TBI) are planned for enrollment. Participants must be at least 18 years old, have a Glasgow Coma Score of 15, report pain of at least 3/10 within 24 hours of enrollment, and be expected to remain hospitalized for at least 12 hours. Key exclusions include inability to consent, history of seizure or known intolerance of VR, pregnancy, and non‑English-speaking status.\n\nEach participant undergoes three different 20‑minute intervention sessions, separated by at least 4 hours and administered in randomized order:\n1. Immersive VR experience: theBlu (WEVR), a calming, dynamic coral reef environment delivered via an Oculus Rift head‑mounted display.\n2. Non‑immersive 2D mimic: a recording of theBlu presented on a tablet, controlling for content but not immersion.\n3. VR sensory deprivation: wearing the Oculus Rift headset with no visual content, controlling for external sensory isolation.\n\nBefore starting the session series, participants complete baseline assessments including prior VR exposure and expectations of VR’s analgesic potential, as well as validated questionnaires: the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Multidimensional State Boredom Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Opioid Risk Tool, and Multidimensional Iowa Suggestibility Scale. These measures are used to explore whether traits such as catastrophic thinking, boredom, anxiety/depression, opioid risk, and suggestibility predict response to VR.\n\nBefore and after each of the three sessions, participants complete a survey capturing numerical rating scales for overall pain, headache, neck/back pain, nausea, dizziness, and light sensitivity, as well as the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (state form). After each session, gaming immersion is assessed with the Brockmyer Gaming Engagement Questionnaire. Vital signs including heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and pupillometry measures are recorded pre- and post-session, and continuous heart rate monitoring is performed during sessions when possible. Chart review captures participant chronic pain history, prehospital opioid use, and in-hospital opioid dosing and routine pain scores.\n\nThe primary outcome is the change in pain severity, measured by the numeric rating scale, pre- to post-session, comparing immersive VR with the two control conditions. Exploratory secondary outcomes include opioid usage, durability of analgesia after sessions, pain assessed via the Trauma Function and Comfort Assessment, changes in anxiety and other affective measures, autonomic markers (such as pupillary maximum constriction velocity, relative constriction amplitude, and heart rate variability), and subjective experience of each intervention. The study also examines whether factors such as gaming engagement, boredom, suggestibility, pain catastrophizing, and anxiety/depression correlate with magnitude of pain reduction under VR.\n\nSafety and feasibility of immersive VR in the acute trauma and TBI population are carefully monitored. Potential risks of VR such as seizures, motion sickness, nausea, and dizziness are assessed during and after each session. If seizures occur, participation is terminated and the clinical team is notified; adverse events are documented and included in safety analyses. Intolerance of the headset or increased nausea/dizziness is recorded as part of feasibility assessment. The clinical care team, which manages all analgesic orders, is blinded to session order. If pain is inadequately controlled during the inpatient stay, additional analgesia is prescribed by the clinical team independently of the research protocol.\n\nThe target sample size of 60 participants allows for an anticipated 30% dropout, yielding 42 completers. This provides approximately 80% power to detect a clinically meaningful difference in pain reduction (defined as about a 33% reduction or 2‑point change on a 0–10 scale) at a one‑sided 0.05 significance level. Mixed-effects linear models will be used to analyze pain and other outcomes over time, accommodating missing data, which are common in a trauma population. Correlations between baseline psychological measures and pain response will be examined using Pearson’s correlation.\n\nThe study protocol is approved by the University of Maryland Baltimore Institutional Review Board (protocol HP-00090603) and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04356963). Data are stored securely in accordance with institutional policies, and adverse events are reviewed weekly by the principal investigator. An interim safety analysis is planned once 20 patients with TBI and 20 without TBI have been enrolled. The overarching goal is to determine whether immersive VR can serve as a safe, feasible, and effective adjunctive analgesic in the acute phase after traumatic injury, potentially contributing to opioid-sparing pain management strategies.""}","{""conditions"": [""Traumatic Injuries"", ""Traumatic Brain Injury"", ""Mild Traumatic Brain Injury"", ""Acute Pain"", ""Headache"", ""Pain, Post-Traumatic""], ""keywords"": [""Virtual Reality"", ""Pain Management"", ""Acute Pain"", ""Trauma"", ""Traumatic Brain Injury"", ""Mild Traumatic Brain Injury"", ""Headache"", ""Opioid Use Disorder"", ""Opioid-Related Disorders"", ""Analgesia, Nonpharmacologic"", ""Opioid-Sparing"", ""Pain Catastrophizing"", ""Anxiety"", ""Depression"", ""Heart Rate Variability"", ""Pupillometry"", ""Gaming Engagement"", ""Suggestibility"", ""Boredom"", ""Hospitalization"", ""Inpatients""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""CROSSOVER"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Randomised, within-subject, crossover clinical trial in which each participant undergoes three different 20-minute sessions (immersive VR, non-immersive 2D tablet mimic, and VR headset with no content) in random order, separated by at least 4 hours."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""SINGLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Treating clinical team writing analgesia orders is blinded to the order of VR vs control sessions; participants and research staff conducting sessions are not blinded."", ""whoMasked"": [""CARE_PROVIDER""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 60, ""type"": ""ESTIMATED""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Immersive VR Therapy"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""Participants undergo a 20-minute immersive virtual reality experience using the Oculus Rift headset.

The main aim was to determine whether CVnCoV prevents symptomatic, virologically confirmed COVID-19 of any severity starting 15 days after the second dose and to characterise its safety profile. The study found that CVnCoV provided moderate protection against symptomatic COVID-19, with higher efficacy against moderate-to-severe disease, in a setting dominated by SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and interest, and that it had an acceptable reactogenicity and safety profile."", ""detailedDescription"": ""HERALD is an ongoing, multicentre, randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 2b/3 clinical trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of the CVnCoV SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine candidate in adults. The trial is conducted at 47 public and private hospitals and clinics across ten countries in Europe (Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain) and Latin America (Argentina, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Panama, Peru).\n\nCVnCoV is a chemically unmodified, lipid nanoparticle–formulated mRNA vaccine based on the RNActive platform. It encodes the stabilised, full-length spike protein of the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strain. Preclinical studies showed robust immunogenicity and protection in animal challenge models, and a preceding phase 1 dose-escalation study identified the 12 μg dose (given twice, 28 days apart) as safe and immunogenic, with antibody responses comparable to convalescent COVID-19 sera.\n\nIn HERALD, adults aged 18 years or older without a history of virologically confirmed COVID-19 were eligible, provided they had not recently received or planned to receive other investigational or non-registered vaccines, certain licensed vaccines within specified windows, or other SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), stratified by country and age group (18–60 years and ≥61 years), to receive two intramuscular injections of CVnCoV (0.6 mL containing 12 μg mRNA) or 0.9% NaCl placebo on days 1 and 29.\n\nThe trial has an initial phase 2b component focused on characterising safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity, and a phase 3 component focused on efficacy and longer-term safety. COVID-19 cases accrued in phase 2b are pooled with those from phase 3 for efficacy analyses. An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) oversees safety, with interim reviews prior to phase 3 initiation and after completion of vaccinations in phase 2b.\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint is the first episode of virologically confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19 of any severity (mild, moderate, or severe), caused by any SARS-CoV-2 strain, occurring from 15 days after the second dose up to one year. Symptomatic disease is identified through active surveillance: participants report potential COVID-19 symptoms, are contacted twice weekly via a mobile application, and, when indicated, undergo rapid antigen testing and central RT-PCR testing. All primary endpoint cases are confirmed by an independent adjudication committee. COVID-19 severity is categorised as mild, moderate, or severe using predefined clinical and physiological criteria, including symptoms, respiratory parameters, oxygen saturation, radiographic evidence, organ dysfunction, ICU admission, and death.\n\nKey secondary efficacy endpoints include the occurrence of first episodes of moderate-to-severe COVID-19, severe COVID-19, and subgroup analyses by age group (18–60 vs ≥61 years). An exploratory endpoint, added via protocol amendment, is efficacy against specific variants of concern or interest, supported by whole-genome sequencing of viral isolates from confirmed cases.\n\nSafety assessments include solicited local and systemic adverse events for 7 days and unsolicited adverse events for 28 days after each dose in phase 2b participants. Medically attended adverse events are collected up to 6 months after the second dose, and serious adverse events, adverse events of special interest, fatal events, and events leading to withdrawal are collected up to 1 year after the second dose in both phase 2b and phase 3 participants. Adverse events are graded by intensity and assessed for relatedness to study vaccination by investigators.\n\nThe trial is event-driven, with sample size and power calculations based on detecting a vaccine efficacy greater than 30% for symptomatic COVID-19 of any severity, assuming a true efficacy of 60% and using a two-sided alpha of 5% with an O'Brien-Fleming type alpha spending approach across interim analyses. The primary efficacy analysis set includes participants who received both doses as randomised, were SARS-CoV-2–naive at baseline and at day 43 (15 days post-second dose), and had not developed COVID-19 prior to day 43.\n\nInterim results up to June 18, 2021, show that among 39,680 randomised participants, 39,529 received at least one dose (19,783 CVnCoV; 19,746 placebo). The primary efficacy analysis included 12,851 CVnCoV and 12,211 placebo recipients, with a mean follow-up of approximately 48 days from 15 days after the second dose. A total of 228 adjudicated cases of symptomatic COVID-19 of any severity occurred (83 in CVnCoV, 145 in placebo), yielding an overall vaccine efficacy of 48.2% (95.826% CI 31.0–61.4) against symptomatic disease, meeting the prespecified success criterion (lower bound >30%). Vaccine efficacy against moderate-to-severe COVID-19 was 70.7% (95% CI 42.5–86.1). In participants aged 18–60 years, efficacy against symptomatic disease was 52.5% (95% CI 36.2–64.8) and against moderate-to-severe disease 77.2% (95% CI 51.8–90.4). There were too few cases in participants aged ≥61 years to derive robust efficacy estimates.\n\nSequencing data indicate that the trial was conducted in a setting dominated by SARS-CoV-2 variants: only about 3% of sequenced cases were wild-type B.1 lineage. Roughly half of cases were caused by variants of concern (including alpha/B.1.1.7 and gamma/P.1) and about one third by variants of interest (including lambda/C.37 and mu/B.1.621). Efficacy estimates against alpha, gamma, and lambda variants in adults 18–60 years were similar to the overall efficacy in that age group.\n\nReactogenicity was higher in the CVnCoV group than in the placebo group. In phase 2b, 96.5% of CVnCoV recipients versus 67.9% of placebo recipients reported at least one solicited local or systemic adverse event; 27.1% versus 3.1% reported grade 3 solicited events. The most common local reaction was injection-site pain; the most frequent systemic reactions were fatigue and headache. These events were generally transient, with a median duration of about 1–2 days, and did not increase in frequency or severity after the second dose. Unsolicited adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse events of special interest were infrequent and similar in overall frequency between groups, although a small number of serious and special-interest events were deemed related to vaccination. No fatal serious adverse events were considered related to study vaccination.\n\nThe investigators conclude that CVnCoV provides moderate protection against symptomatic COVID-19 and substantial protection against moderate-to-severe disease, with an acceptable safety profile, in a challenging environment with widespread circulation of SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, considering the evolving pandemic, emergence of new variants, and development timelines, the sponsor has decided to discontinue further development of CVnCoV and prioritise next-generation mRNA vaccine candidates.""}","{""conditions"": [""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2 Infection""], ""keywords"": [""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""Coronavirus Infections"", ""mRNA Vaccines"", ""CVnCoV"", ""HERALD trial"", ""Symptomatic COVID-19"", ""Moderate-to-Severe COVID-19"", ""Severe COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2 Variants"", ""Alpha Variant"", ""Gamma Variant"", ""Lambda Variant"", ""Mu Variant"", ""Vaccine Efficacy"", ""Vaccine Safety""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""PHASE2"", ""PHASE3""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 2b/3 trial in which adults were assigned 1:1 to receive two doses of CVnCoV or placebo in parallel groups."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""PREVENTION"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""TRIPLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Observer-blinded design: site personnel preparing vaccine were unblinded but not involved in further conduct; investigators, site personnel involved in conduct, and statisticians analyzing data were masked to group assignment; an independent, blinded central adjudication committee assessed primary efficacy outcomes."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT"", ""CARE_PROVIDER"", ""INVESTIGATOR"", ""OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 39680, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""CVnCoV 12 μg"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Participants received two 0.6 mL intramuscular injections of the CVnCoV SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine candidate, each dose containing 12 μg of chemically unmodified mRNA formulated with the RNActive mRNA vaccine platform and lipid nanoparticles, administered in the deltoid muscle on days 1 and 29."", ""interventionNames"": [""CVnCoV SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine 12 μg""]}, {""label"": ""Placebo 0.9% NaCl"", ""type"": ""PLACEBO_COMPARATOR"", ""description"": ""Participants received two 0.6 mL intramuscular injections of placebo consisting of 0.9% sodium chloride solution, administered in the deltoid muscle on days 1 and 29."", ""interventionNames"": [""0.9% NaCl placebo""]}], ""interventions"": [{""type"": ""BIOLOGICAL"", ""name"": ""CVnCoV SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine 12 μg"", ""description"": ""CVnCoV is a chemically unmodified mRNA vaccine candidate based on the RNActive mRNA vaccine platform, encoding the stabilised, full-length, native SARS-CoV-2 spike protein of the wild-type strain.

Children applied the diclofenac patch twice daily for up to 14 days or until pain resolved. The main focus was to determine whether the patch is safe and well tolerated in a pediatric population, with minimal systemic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug exposure, while providing effective pain relief similar to that seen in adults."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This post-marketing, open-label, single-arm phase IV clinical trial was conducted at ten family medicine or pediatric practices in the USA from May 2014 to October 2016. The study was required by the US Food and Drug Administration to characterize the safety and efficacy of the FLECTOR diclofenac epolamine topical system (FDETS, 1.3% diclofenac epolamine; 180 mg per 10 × 14 cm system) in a pediatric population.\n\nEligible participants were children aged 6–16 years who had sustained a clinically significant minor soft tissue injury (e.g., minor strains, sprains, contusions, sports-related trauma not requiring surgery or immobilization) within the previous 96 hours and reported at least moderate spontaneous pain, defined as a score of ≥3 on the 0–5 Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale. Exclusion criteria included major or midline injuries, involvement of spine, digits, or hands, open skin lesions in the treatment area, severe cardiac, renal, or hepatic impairment, recent use of long-acting NSAIDs or topical medications at the injury site, and concomitant medications that could interact with diclofenac or pose safety risks. Post-menarcheal girls required a negative pregnancy test.\n\nAll enrolled patients received FDETS applied directly to the injury site twice daily (morning and evening) until pain resolution or up to Day 14. The first patch was applied in clinic under supervision, and subsequent applications were performed at home by patients or their caregivers. If the patch overlapped on itself at the application site, it could be trimmed; if a patch detached due to water exposure, a replacement patch could be applied, allowing up to three patches in a single day. Patients were instructed to avoid other topical medications on the injured area and systemic analgesics including other NSAIDs, opioids, and systemic corticosteroids; non-pharmacologic measures such as rest-ice-compression-elevation were allowed.\n\nThe primary endpoint was local tolerability and systemic safety. Local tolerability at the application site was assessed at each clinic visit using a 7-point scale (0 = no skin changes to 6 = severe erythema with extension beyond the contact area), capturing redness and other skin reactions. Adverse events were monitored throughout the study and coded using MedDRA. Vital signs were recorded at clinic visits; specific cardiovascular or renal event monitoring was not implemented, given known low systemic exposure from this topical formulation.\n\nKey secondary endpoints were systemic diclofenac exposure and analgesic efficacy. Systemic exposure was evaluated via plasma diclofenac concentrations measured by a validated HPLC–MS/MS assay (quantitation range 0.05–50 ng/mL). Two 5 mL blood samples were planned per patient: one approximately 24 hours after the first patch application (Day 2 visit) and another at the final study visit (on pain resolution or Day 14). Sampling occurred while a patch was in place; timing was not fixed relative to dosing, so 2–3 patches might have been applied by the first sample. Data were analyzed overall and by age subgroup (6–11 years and 12–16 years) and compared with historical adult pharmacokinetic data from a separate study (CRO-PK-01-72) in which adults received FDETS twice daily for 4 days or a single 50 mg oral diclofenac tablet.\n\nAnalgesic efficacy was evaluated using patient-reported Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale scores (0–5). Baseline pain was recorded in clinic prior to the first application, and patients then recorded morning and evening pain scores in diaries throughout treatment. Pain scores over time were analyzed as a proportion of baseline (1.0 = no change, 0.0 = no pain). Pain trajectories in the pediatric age groups were compared using generalized estimating equations and contrasted with pain data from an adult study (00GB/Fp05) using FDETS. Investigators also provided a global response to therapy at the final visit on a 1–5 scale, from no clinical improvement to complete restoration of normal function without pain.\n\nThe study enrolled 104 patients, evenly split between ages 6–11 and 12–16 years (mean age 11.6 years). The most common injury sites were ankle, knee, foot, and wrist. Patients used the patch for a mean of 9.5 days, with an average of 2.1 patches per day.\n\nLocal tolerability was excellent: at screening, 93% of patients had no skin changes; over the course of treatment the highest observed score was 1 (faint redness), and by the last observation among patients still using FDETS all had a score of 0. No higher-grade application-site reactions were recorded.\n\nA total of 54 adverse events were reported in 32 patients (30.8%), with similar frequencies across age groups. There were no serious adverse events. The most common events were headache and pruritus, followed by mild gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, stomach discomfort, upper abdominal pain) and a few other symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, and epistaxis. Fourteen events in nine patients (8.7%) were considered at least possibly related to FDETS; pruritus was the most frequent treatment-related event. All adverse events were mild or moderate, and vital signs remained within normal ranges.\n\nPain decreased progressively in both age groups, with a somewhat faster and greater reduction in children aged 6–11 years compared with those aged 12–16 years. The pain trajectory in the older pediatric group resembled that observed in adults from the historical study. By the end of the study, 87% of patients had a pain score of 0 at clinic visits, and most remaining patients had minimal residual pain (score 1). Investigators rated 83.7% of patients as restored to normal function in the absence of pain.\n\nSystemic diclofenac exposure was low. Mean plasma concentrations for all pediatric patients were approximately 1.65 ng/mL at the first assessment and 1.80 ng/mL at the last assessment. Younger children had higher mean concentrations than adolescents (about 1.83 vs 1.46 ng/mL at the first assessment and 2.49 vs 1.11 ng/mL at the last), but levels remained low and were substantially lower than those seen after oral diclofenac dosing. When adjusted for sampling time (<13 h post-application) and trimming, geometric mean steady-state diclofenac concentrations were similar between the overall pediatric cohort (1.07 ng/mL) and historical adults treated with FDETS (1.18 ng/mL), with a 90% confidence interval indicating equivalence in systemic exposure. In contrast, mean maximum concentrations after a single 50 mg oral diclofenac tablet in adults were more than 500-fold higher than those achieved with FDETS in either children or adults.\n\nAnalyses did not demonstrate a significant correlation between the low, variable plasma diclofenac concentrations and the magnitude of pain relief, supporting the interpretation that local tissue concentrations under the patch, rather than systemic drug levels, are primarily responsible for the analgesic effect.\n\nOverall, the study showed that in children aged 6–16 years with minor soft tissue injuries, twice-daily application of FDETS for up to 14 days was associated with excellent local tolerability, low rates of generally mild adverse events, minimal systemic diclofenac exposure, and clinically meaningful pain relief. The safety, pharmacokinetic, and efficacy profiles in this pediatric cohort were consistent with previously reported adult data, supporting the use of FDETS for acute pain due to minor soft tissue injuries in pediatric patients.""}","{""conditions"": [""Soft Tissue Injuries"", ""Sprains and Strains"", ""Contusions"", ""Acute Pain"", ""Musculoskeletal Pain"", ""Sports Injuries""], ""keywords"": [""diclofenac epolamine"", ""FLECTOR"", ""topical NSAIDs"", ""transdermal drug delivery systems"", ""pediatric pain management"", ""minor soft tissue injury"", ""ankle sprain"", ""musculoskeletal trauma"", ""post-marketing safety"", ""nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE4""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""NON_RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""SINGLE_GROUP"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Open-label, single-arm study of FLECTOR diclofenac epolamine topical system applied twice daily in pediatric patients with minor soft tissue injuries."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Open-label study with no blinding of participants, investigators, or outcome assessors."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 104, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""FLECTOR diclofenac epolamine topical system"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Open-label, single-arm phase IV study in which all pediatric patients aged 6–16 years with minor soft tissue injuries received the FLECTOR diclofenac epolamine topical system (FDETS) applied to the site of injury twice daily until pain resolution or up to Day 14."", ""interventionNames"": [""Diclofenac epolamine topical system (FLECTOR)""]}], ""interventions"": [{""type"": ""DRUG"", ""name"": ""Diclofenac epolamine topical system (FLECTOR)"", ""description"": ""FLECTOR diclofenac epolamine topical system (FDETS), a medicated patch containing 1.3% diclofenac epolamine (180 mg; equivalent to 140 mg diclofenac sodium) in an adhesive matrix on a 10 × 14 cm non-woven polyester backing.

Adults with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease and clinically evident gait or balance problems completed two weeks of twice-daily home-based prism adaptation using goggles that shifted the visual field upward, or sham goggles with no shift. Posture and gait were assessed before and immediately after treatment using clinical balance and gait tests, computerized posturography, and self-report questionnaires, with additional questionnaire follow-up up to 3 months. The main hypothesis was that real prism adaptation would shift the body’s center of gravity forward, leading to better stepping performance, balance, and functional mobility compared with sham. The study found that although prism adaptation increased forward stepping velocity, it did not produce meaningful improvements in balance, gait, or daily functioning compared with sham treatment."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This study evaluated the therapeutic potential of sensorimotor prism adaptation for gait disturbance and postural instability in Parkinson’s disease. Gait initiation and freezing in Parkinson’s disease have been linked to difficulty shifting the body’s center of gravity (COG) forward and downward over the feet. Prior proof-of-principle work showed that a single session of adaptation to upward-shifting prisms reduced forward stepping latencies in people with Parkinson’s disease, suggesting that repeated sessions might induce a forward COG shift and improve gait and balance.\n\nDesign and participants:\nThe trial used a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, sham-controlled design. Participants were adults (40–85 years) with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease recruited from a balance and vestibular clinic. Eligibility required at least one of: Hoehn and Yahr stage II.5–IV, a score > 0 on the gait, freezing of gait, or postural stability items of the MDS-UPDRS Part III, or a Timed Up and Go (TUG) time > 12 seconds. Exclusion criteria included other neurological or psychiatric conditions that could affect gait or balance, normal MDS-UPDRS Part III, right arm impairment preventing pointing, inadequate vision for the task, or insufficient English for consent. Thirty-one patients were enrolled; 18 were allocated to real prism adaptation (16 analyzed) and 13 to sham (all analyzed).\n\nIntervention:\nParticipants were randomized using a sealed-envelope style allocation to either real or sham adaptation. Real adaptation involved wearing goggles fitted with Fresnel lenses that induced a ~17° upward shift of the visual field; sham goggles produced no optical shift. In each session, participants sat facing a wall-mounted target sheet and made 50 rapid pointing movements with the right index finger to two vertically arranged targets while wearing the goggles, minimizing head movement. They were trained in-person and then performed the treatment at home twice daily for 14 days. Adherence and subjective attention, fatigue, and effort were recorded in logbooks. Participants, caregivers, and outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nOutcomes and assessments:\nPrimary outcomes were measures of postural control: (1) Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and (2) computerized posturography using the Smart EquiTest Balance Master system, including the Limits of Stability (LOS) test, Sensory Organization Test (SOT), and Motor Control Test (MCT). The LOS assessed reaction time, maximum COG movement velocity, and maximum excursion in forward and backward directions while leaning without stepping. The SOT evaluated postural stability and COG alignment under different combinations of visual and proprioceptive conditions, focusing on composite equilibrium scores and forward–backward COG alignment. The MCT measured automatic postural response latencies to platform translations.\n\nSecondary outcomes included clinical gait measures and self-report instruments. Clinical gait measures were the Timed Up and Go test, Functional Gait Assessment, and the Walk Across test from the EquiTest (step length and speed). Self-report measures included the New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire, Falls Efficacy Scale, Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, and the Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire-39 (overall, mobility, and activities of daily living subscales). Patient’s Global Impressions of Change ratings were collected post-treatment and at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months to capture subjective change in overall status, freezing, walking, and balance. Baseline neurologic assessment included MDS-UPDRS Part III, Hoehn and Yahr staging, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment.\n\nTesting schedule:\nIn-person assessments were conducted immediately before treatment (pre) and one day after the 2-week intervention (1d post). Questionnaires were also administered by mail at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after the end of treatment to examine persistence of any effects.\n\nResults:\nGroups were generally well matched at baseline on demographic, clinical, and questionnaire measures, and compliance with the prescribed number of sessions was similar between groups. Blinding appeared successful; participants’ guesses about their allocation did not differ significantly between groups, and no treatment-related harms were reported.\n\nOn the primary postural outcomes, there were no significant group differences or time × group interactions for the Berg Balance Scale, SOT composite scores or COG alignment, or MCT latencies. In the LOS test, both groups showed faster and larger forward versus backward leaning overall. A significant group × time × direction interaction emerged for maximum movement velocity: the real prism group showed a significant increase in forward stepping velocity after treatment, while the sham group did not show a similar change. However, there were no corresponding changes in backward stepping velocity or other LOS parameters that would suggest a broader functional improvement.\n\nSecondary outcomes showed no main effects or interactions for TUG, Functional Gait Assessment, Walk Across step length, or step speed. Across all follow-up periods, questionnaire scores (New Freezing of Gait, Falls Efficacy, Activities-specific Balance Confidence, and PDQ-39 total and subscales) did not show differential improvements between the real and sham groups. Patient’s Global Impressions of Change ratings stayed below levels indicating meaningful improvement in both groups, and paradoxically, the real treatment group, on average, reported less perceived improvement than the sham group.\n\nInterpretation:\nThe regimen of 2 weeks of twice-daily adaptation to upward-shifting prisms produced a measurable increase in forward stepping velocity but did not translate into improvements in global postural control, gait performance, or perceived daily function compared to sham. COG alignment at rest did not change, suggesting that any prism-induced changes in stepping dynamics were insufficient to shift the resting body configuration forward or to improve freezing or gait stability. The authors note potential limitations, including the lack of direct measurement of adaptation after-effects during the treatment period, unrecorded co-interventions such as ongoing physiotherapy, and the possibility that a different dose, larger prism strength, longer treatment duration, or alternative prism directions might yield different results. They also point out that adaptation to vertical visual shifts may differ fundamentally from adaptation to horizontal shifts that have shown benefit in stroke-related postural imbalance.\n\nThe study concludes that this specific protocol—2 weeks of twice-daily home-based adaptation to upward-shifting prisms—should not currently be recommended as a treatment for gait disturbance or postural instability in Parkinson’s disease, although the observation of increased forward stepping velocity suggests a possible avenue for further research with modified protocols.""}","{""conditions"": [""Parkinson Disease"", ""Gait Disorders, Neurologic"", ""Postural Balance"", ""Freezing of Gait""], ""keywords"": [""Parkinson’s disease"", ""gait disturbance"", ""postural control"", ""postural instability"", ""freezing of gait"", ""center of gravity"", ""prism adaptation"", ""visual shift"", ""sensorimotor adaptation"", ""Falls Efficacy"", ""balance confidence"", ""Berg Balance Scale"", ""Timed Up and Go"", ""Functional Gait Assessment"", ""posturography""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial comparing two weeks of twice-daily real prism adaptation versus sham prism adaptation in people with Parkinson’s disease."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": ""OTHER"", ""timePerspective"": ""OTHER"", ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Participants, caregivers, and researchers assessing outcomes were blinded to whether participants received real or sham prism adaptation."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT"", ""CARE_PROVIDER"", ""OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 29, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Real prism adaptation"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Participants performed twice-daily home-based prism adaptation for 14 days using goggles fitted with Fresnel lenses that induced a 25-dioptre (~17°) upward shift in the visual image.

Participants receive electronic pill bottles and are randomized to: (1) a non-adaptive intervention linking medication-taking to a self-chosen daily cue plus a fixed charitable donation reward and conditional reminder texts; (2) an adaptive intervention that starts with a lower charitable reward and no texts, with escalation to higher rewards and cue-reminder texts if adherence is suboptimal at 6 weeks; or (3) a control arm with electronic monitoring only. The primary outcome is medication adherence over 18 weeks; secondary outcomes include habit automaticity, integration of medication-taking into routines, intentions and perceptions about medications, and exploratory changes in serum uric acid."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This pragmatic, prospective, three-arm parallel randomized controlled trial evaluates a habit formation intervention to improve adherence to daily urate-lowering therapy (ULT) among adults with gout who have suboptimal serum uric acid control. Non-adherence to chronic medications is common and contributes to preventable morbidity, and poor adherence to ULT is a key reason many gout patients fail to achieve target uric acid levels and continue to experience debilitating flares. The intervention is grounded in habit formation theory, specifically the cue–reward–repetition model, which proposes that repeatedly performing a behavior in response to a consistent cue and receiving a reward leads to automaticity, such that the behavior becomes a habit driven by contextual cues rather than conscious intention.\n\nEligible participants are adults (≥18 years) with gout receiving a stable oral ULT regimen and with a recent serum uric acid level >6 mg/dL. They are recruited from rheumatology and primary care practices affiliated with Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and must have a smartphone with data or WiFi and be able to use electronic pill bottles; pregnant individuals and those unable to participate in English are excluded. After remote screening, electronic informed consent, and baseline questionnaires, participants are randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio, using block randomization stratified by recruitment source (rheumatology vs primary care) and baseline uric acid (>6.0–8.0 mg/dL vs >8.0 mg/dL), to one of two intervention arms or a control arm.\n\nAll participants receive electronic pill bottles (Pillsy) that record date and time of each opening via Bluetooth to a smartphone app and cloud portal, with device alerts disabled to minimize additional adherence prompts. Adherence is operationalized as the proportion of recorded bottle openings to prescribed doses, capped at one opening per 3-hour window to avoid counting multiple openings as extra doses. For patients on multiple study medications, adherence is averaged across medications.\n\nIn Arm 1 (non-adaptive intervention), participants select a daily lifestyle cue (e.g., brushing teeth) to which they will link medication-taking during a structured goal-setting exercise. They also choose a charity (local animal shelter, local food bank, or UNICEF). A sticker with the charity logo is placed under the pill bottle cap to reinforce the association between medication-taking and the charitable reward. For every adherent day over a 12-week intervention period, US$0.50 is donated to their chosen charity. Every 4 days, participants receive text messages summarizing donations and describing their potential impact. If 4-day adherence falls below 75%, participants receive additional reminder texts about their chosen cue. After 12 weeks, the intervention stops and participants are observed for a further 6 weeks without any cues or rewards.\n\nIn Arm 2 (adaptive intervention), participants initially receive the same cue-based structure and charitable donations but with a lower reward of US$0.25 per adherent day and no reminder texts for the first 6 weeks. At 6 weeks, adherence is assessed; participants whose adherence is <75% are “intensified”: they begin to receive cue-reminder text messages similar to Arm 1 and their charitable reward increases to US$0.50 per adherent day for the remaining 6 weeks. Participants in this arm are then followed for an additional 6 weeks without any intervention, for a total of 18 weeks.\n\nArm 3 (control) participants receive the electronic pill bottles for adherence monitoring only and no cue or reward intervention during the 18-week follow-up.\n\nBaseline data collection includes demographics, medical history, disease activity, and self-reported adherence, as well as measures of habit-related constructs. These include the Self-Report Behaviour Automaticity Index to assess the extent to which medication-taking is automatic; a routine assessment questionnaire evaluating how well medication-taking is integrated into daily routines; and a modified HIV Intention and Knowledge scale assessing intentions and perceptions about medications. Coexisting conditions and uric acid values are obtained from the electronic health record. At the end of follow-up, participants complete a questionnaire mirroring baseline measures, along with questions on the acceptability, feasibility, and perceived usefulness of the intervention. Participants receive a US$50 gift card after completing the end-of-study survey.\n\nThe primary outcome is mean adherence to ULT over 18 weeks post-randomization, calculated as the average proportion of prescribed doses taken (based on pill bottle openings) across study medications. Secondary outcomes include changes from baseline in medication-taking automaticity, sense of routine, and intentions/perceptions about medications, as well as feasibility and acceptability metrics within the intervention arms. Exploratory analyses will examine changes in serum uric acid from baseline using EHR values closest to the end of follow-up, recognizing that uric acid assessments may be incomplete (anticipated 15–20% missing) and potentially differential by adherence.\n\nAnalyses will follow intention-to-treat principles, including all randomized participants. Baseline characteristics will be summarized by arm, and intervention arms will be compared to control using appropriate parametric or non-parametric tests. Primary and exploratory continuous outcomes (mean adherence and serum uric acid) will be evaluated using generalized estimating equations with identity link and normal errors; adjusted analyses will be performed if baseline imbalances are present. Sensitivity analyses using multiple imputation and alternative lab time points will be considered if missing outcome data are substantial. The sample size of 20 participants per arm (60 total) is powered (80% at alpha 0.05) to detect a 20% relative increase in adherence from a baseline adherence rate of 50% in each intervention arm compared with control.\n\nThe study has Institutional Review Board approval at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Due to the behavioral and low-risk nature of the trial, no data monitoring committee was required. Data analysts will be blinded to treatment assignments, but participants cannot be blinded to the cue–reward intervention. Trial results will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed, publicly accessible journal. If effective, this individualized, habit-based cue–reward approach to medication adherence could be adapted and scaled to other chronic conditions, healthcare settings, and health behaviors.""}","{""conditions"": [""Gout"", ""Arthritis, Gouty"", ""Hyperuricemia"", ""Medication Adherence""], ""keywords"": [""Gout"", ""Arthritis, Gouty"", ""Hyperuricemia"", ""Urate-lowering therapy"", ""Allopurinol"", ""Febuxostat"", ""Medication adherence"", ""Patient compliance"", ""Habit formation"", ""Behavioral intervention"", ""Randomized controlled trial"", ""Electronic medication monitoring"", ""Uric acid""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Pragmatic, prospective, three-arm parallel randomized controlled trial with two cue-reward habit-formation intervention arms (one non-adaptive, one adaptive) and one control arm, follow-up 18 weeks."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""SINGLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Data analysts at the end of the study will be blinded to arm assignment; patients are not blinded due to the nature of the interventions."", ""whoMasked"": [""OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 60, ""type"": ""ESTIMATED""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Arm 1: Non-adaptive cue-reward intervention"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Participants receive a fixed-intensity habit formation intervention over 12 weeks.

Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, required at least 3 L/min of oxygen, had a WHO Clinical Progression Scale score of 5, and were not receiving any form of ventilatory support. Participants were randomly assigned to receive usual care alone or usual care plus intravenous sarilumab 400 mg on day 1, with an optional second 400 mg dose on day 3 if oxygen needs had not decreased sufficiently. The co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with clinical worsening (WHO score >5) at day 4 and survival without need for non-invasive or mechanical ventilation at day 14. Among 148 randomised patients, sarilumab did not reduce early clinical worsening or the need for ventilation or death by day 14 compared with usual care, and 90‑day survival was similar between groups. Safety profiles, including serious adverse events, were comparable, indicating that sarilumab did not confer a clear short-term benefit in this population."", ""detailedDescription"": ""The CORIMUNO-SARI-1 trial is part of the CORIMUNO-19 platform, a series of cohort-embedded, adaptive, open-label randomised controlled trials conducted in six French hospitals during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The rationale is based on the observation that patients with COVID-19 pneumonia often exhibit a hyperinflammatory response with elevated cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), which may drive lung injury and respiratory failure. Sarilumab is a high-affinity monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), designed to block IL-6 signalling and potentially mitigate this hyperinflammatory state.\n\nAdults (≥18 years) hospitalised with laboratory-confirmed or CT-supported SARS-CoV-2 infection were eligible for the CORIMUNO-19 cohort if they had pneumonia ranging from mild-to-critical. For CORIMUNO-SARI-1 specifically, patients had moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia defined by a WHO Clinical Progression Scale (WHO-CPS) score of 5 (hospitalised, requiring oxygen by mask or nasal prongs), needing at least 3 L/min of oxygen, and not receiving high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, or invasive mechanical ventilation at enrolment. Pregnant women and other patients meeting predefined exclusion criteria were not enrolled.\n\nParticipants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio via a secure web system to receive either usual care alone or usual care plus sarilumab. Randomisation was stratified by centre and used randomly varying block sizes. The trial was open-label due to logistical constraints early in the pandemic; no placebo infusion was used. Sarilumab was administered intravenously at a fixed dose of 400 mg on day 1, with a second 400 mg IV dose on day 3 recommended if oxygen requirement had not decreased by more than 50%, at the discretion of the treating physician. Usual care (e.g., antibiotics, antivirals, corticosteroids, anticoagulants, vasopressors) followed local practice without protocol-mandated regimens. Some patients in the usual care group later received other IL-6R inhibitors (tocilizumab or sarilumab) or corticosteroids.\n\nThe trial used a Bayesian adaptive design with prespecified interim analyses. Two co-primary endpoints were defined, aligned with WHO-recommended core outcomes: (1) the proportion of patients with WHO-CPS score >5 (i.e., requiring non-invasive or mechanical ventilation, or worse) at day 4, analysed as a binary outcome via Bayesian methods; and (2) time to first occurrence of non-invasive ventilation (including high-flow oxygen), mechanical ventilation, or death up to day 14, analysed as a Bayesian time-to-event outcome. Efficacy decision rules were based on posterior probabilities for absolute risk difference (day 4) and hazard ratio (day 14), including thresholds for any benefit and for moderate or greater benefit, while futility was defined by a low posterior probability of moderate benefit.\n\nSecondary outcomes included WHO-CPS scores at days 7 and 14 (analysed with proportional odds models), overall survival up to day 90, time to hospital discharge, time to independence from oxygen, and safety endpoints (adverse events, serious adverse events, and causes of death). Inflammatory and laboratory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, D-dimer, ferritin, and liver enzymes were also monitored.\n\nBetween March 27 and April 6, 2020, 148 patients were randomised (68 to sarilumab and 80 to usual care); four usual care patients later withdrew consent and were excluded from analysis. Baseline characteristics, including age (median ~62 years), sex distribution (about three quarters male), oxygen flow (median 5–6 L/min), comorbidities (chronic cardiac disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, pulmonary disease), and inflammatory markers (e.g., median CRP ~155–160 mg/L), were generally balanced between groups.\n\nFor the day 4 primary endpoint, 26% of patients in both arms had WHO-CPS >5 (18/68 in the sarilumab group vs 20/76 in usual care), yielding a median posterior absolute risk difference of 0.2% (90% credible interval −11.7 to 12.2) and a posterior probability of any benefit (risk difference <0) of 48.9%. For the day 14 co-primary endpoint, 37% of sarilumab-treated patients and 34% of usual care patients experienced non-invasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation, or death (posterior median hazard ratio 1.10; 90% credible interval 0.69–1.74). The posterior probability of any beneficial effect (HR <1) was 37.4%, and the probability of a moderate or greater benefit (HR <0.85) was 18.6%, indicating no convincing efficacy signal.\n\nSecondary analyses showed no significant differences in clinical status at days 7 and 14 by WHO-CPS, or in time to discharge or oxygen independence by day 28. By day 90, mortality was 15% (10/68) in the sarilumab arm and 21% (16/76) in the usual care arm (adjusted hazard ratio for death 0.70; 95% CI 0.31–1.58), a non-significant difference. Sarilumab induced a rapid decline in CRP and neutrophil counts, consistent with IL-6 pathway inhibition, but this biological effect did not translate into a clear clinical benefit. Post-hoc subgroup analysis according to baseline CRP level (>150 mg/L) did not reveal a subgroup with evident benefit.\n\nSafety data indicated that overall adverse events were somewhat more frequent numerically with sarilumab (77 events in 37 patients) than with usual care (58 events in 33 patients), leading to a higher incidence rate per 1000 patient-days, though the number of patients experiencing at least one event did not differ significantly. Serious adverse events occurred in 40% of sarilumab patients and 37% of usual care patients. Bacterial sepsis was the most common serious adverse event in both arms. Neutropenia, a known effect of IL-6R blockade, occurred only in sarilumab-treated patients. Overall, serious adverse events and causes of death were similar between groups, without new major safety concerns.\n\nThe investigators interpret these findings as indicating that, in adults with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring oxygen but not ventilatory support and treated largely without routine corticosteroids early in the pandemic, sarilumab at 400 mg IV (with an optional second dose) did not improve early clinical outcomes or clearly improve survival compared with usual care. The study’s limitations include its modest sample size, open-label design, variability in concomitant treatments (notably infrequent dexamethasone use), and restriction to a specific disease severity (WHO-CPS 5). The results are discussed in the context of other trials and meta-analyses of IL-6 receptor inhibitors (sarilumab and tocilizumab), including evidence suggesting possible synergy with corticosteroids and variable efficacy across severity strata.\n\nOverall, this trial suggests that sarilumab does not meaningfully reduce the need for non-invasive or mechanical ventilation or death in this targeted population of patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia, while leaving open the possibility that different dosing, timing, or combination with corticosteroids might have different effects. Further larger, adequately powered trials and pooled analyses are recommended to more definitively assess the role of sarilumab and other IL-6R antagonists in COVID-19.""}","{""conditions"": [""COVID-19"", ""COVID-19 pneumonia"", ""SARS-CoV-2 infection"", ""Pneumonia, Viral"", ""Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"", ""Respiratory Insufficiency"", ""Cytokine Release Syndrome"", ""Hyperinflammation""], ""keywords"": [""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID-19 pneumonia"", ""Pneumonia, Viral"", ""Interleukin-6"", ""IL-6"", ""Interleukin-6 Receptor"", ""Sarilumab"", ""Monoclonal Antibodies"", ""Immunomodulation"", ""Cytokine Storm"", ""Hyperinflammation"", ""Respiratory Failure"", ""Oxygen Therapy"", ""Non-invasive Ventilation"", ""Mechanical Ventilation"", ""WHO Clinical Progression Scale"", ""Randomized Controlled Trial"", ""Bayesian Adaptive Design""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE2"", ""PHASE3""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Multicentre, open-label, Bayesian randomised, adaptive, phase 2/3 clinical trial with two parallel groups: sarilumab plus usual care versus usual care alone, nested within the CORIMUNO-19 cohort."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Open-label trial; participants and treating clinicians were aware of group assignment.

All participants have reduced kidney function and increased albumin in their urine despite standard treatments such as ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers, and some are on SGLT2 inhibitors. Participants are randomized to three different doses of AZD5718 or placebo for 12 weeks on top of their usual care, followed by 8 weeks in which all participants also receive the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin. The main goal is to determine whether AZD5718, especially when combined with dapagliflozin, further reduces urinary albumin‑to‑creatinine ratio (UACR), a surrogate marker for risk of kidney failure. The study also evaluates effects on kidney function, blood pressure, safety, pharmacokinetics, leukotriene pathway biomarkers, and, in a substudy, diabetic retinopathy."", ""detailedDescription"": ""FLAIR (FLAP Inhibition in Renal disease) is a phase 2b, randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, multicenter clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of the FLAP inhibitor AZD5718 in adults with proteinuric chronic kidney disease (CKD), with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Leukotrienes are proinflammatory and vasoconstrictive lipid mediators generated via the 5‑lipoxygenase/FLAP pathway and are implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases and CKD pathogenesis. AZD5718 is a potent, selective, reversible FLAP inhibitor that suppresses biosynthesis of leukotriene B4 and the cysteinyl leukotrienes (C4, D4, E4).\n\nEligible participants are ≥18 years of age, have albuminuric CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 20–75 mL/min/1.73 m² and urinary albumin‑to‑creatinine ratio [UACR] 200–5000 mg/g), and are on stable standard of care including ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers when tolerated. Patients may have diabetic or nondiabetic CKD; approximately two‑thirds will have type 2 diabetic kidney disease and one‑third nondiabetic CKD. Use of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP‑1 receptor agonists is allowed if doses are stable before randomization. Key exclusions include polycystic kidney disease or anatomical causes of CKD, type 1 diabetes, severe hepatic impairment, active or recent severe COVID‑19, certain immunomodulatory or interacting drugs, and pregnancy or breastfeeding.\n\nParticipants are randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive one of three AZD5718 doses or matching placebo once daily for 12 weeks, added to their existing therapy. Randomization is stratified by presence of type 2 diabetes, pre‑existing SGLT2 inhibitor use, and Japanese vs non‑Japanese participants. After 12 weeks, participants without complete resolution of albuminuria (<30 mg/g) enter an 8‑week extension in which all continue their assigned AZD5718 or placebo and additionally receive dapagliflozin 10 mg/day, representing anticipated future standard of care. Participants previously on other SGLT2 inhibitors switch to dapagliflozin for this period. The total on‑treatment duration is 20 weeks, followed by a 4‑week safety follow‑up.\n\nThe primary objective is to characterize the dose–response effect of AZD5718 plus dapagliflozin on UACR from baseline to week 20. The key secondary objective is to assess the dose–response effect of AZD5718 on UACR at week 12 when given on top of current standard of care (with limited or no mandated SGLT2 inhibitor use). Other secondary objectives include evaluation of safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics of AZD5718, effects on ambulatory blood pressure, and effects on kidney function (eGFR) with and without dapagliflozin. Exploratory objectives include assessing dose–response effects on urinary and plasma leukotriene E4 as a pharmacodynamic biomarker of 5‑lipoxygenase pathway inhibition; collecting plasma, serum, and urine for additional biomarkers of inflammation and fibrosis (e.g., high‑sensitivity C‑reactive protein, interleukin‑6, PRO‑C6) that may reflect or predict response; assessing a subset of participants with diabetic kidney disease for changes in diabetic retinopathy using visual acuity (ETDRS charts) and optical coherence tomography; and characterizing dapagliflozin pharmacokinetics after 8 weeks of co‑administration.\n\nEfficacy is primarily assessed by change in UACR. To reduce variability, participants collect first‑morning urine samples for three consecutive days before each study visit; the geometric mean of triplicate UACR values is used for analyses. Kidney function is assessed using the CKD‑EPI creatinine‑based eGFR equation, with cystatin C collected for exploratory analyses including combined creatinine/cystatin C‑based eGFR. Safety assessments include adverse event and serious adverse event monitoring, physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs, and routine laboratory tests. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is performed at baseline and week 12 to quantify 24‑hour mean systolic blood pressure and ensure absence of clinically relevant hypertensive effects.\n\nThe planned sample size is 632 participants (158 per group), which, allowing for approximately 10% discontinuation, provides 91% power to detect a 30% reduction in UACR between the highest AZD5718 dose and placebo at a two‑sided alpha of 0.1, and at least 80% power to detect a dose‑response in the diabetic kidney disease stratum. The trial is being conducted at approximately 120 sites in 11 countries, with at least 72 Japanese participants to meet local regulatory requirements. The study follows Good Clinical Practice, the Declaration of Helsinki, and relevant regulatory guidelines. Outcomes are intended to determine whether FLAP inhibition with AZD5718 can meaningfully reduce albuminuria and favorably affect kidney and cardiovascular risk markers in CKD, inform AZD5718 dose selection, define responder populations using biomarker data, and guide the design of future phase 3 trials using eGFR slope and other hard renal endpoints.""}","{""conditions"": [""Chronic Kidney Disease"", ""Proteinuria"", ""Albuminuria"", ""Diabetic Nephropathies"", ""Nondiabetic Kidney Diseases"", ""Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus"", ""Diabetic Kidney Disease"", ""Hypertension""], ""keywords"": [""Chronic Kidney Disease"", ""CKD"", ""Proteinuria"", ""Albuminuria"", ""Diabetic Nephropathy"", ""Diabetic Kidney Disease"", ""Nondiabetic Chronic Kidney Disease"", ""Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus"", ""Hypertension"", ""5-Lipoxygenase Activating Protein"", ""FLAP inhibitor"", ""AZD5718"", ""Leukotrienes"", ""Leukotriene B4"", ""Leukotriene E4"", ""SGLT2 Inhibitors"", ""Dapagliflozin"", ""Renin–Angiotensin–Aldosterone System"", ""Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors"", ""Angiotensin Receptor Blockers"", ""Inflammation"", ""Biomarkers"", ""Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate"", ""eGFR"", ""Urinary Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio"", ""UACR"", ""Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring"", ""Diabetic Retinopathy""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Four-arm, parallel-group trial in which participants are randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive one of three doses of AZD5718 or matching placebo once daily for 12 weeks, followed by an 8-week extension where all continue assigned AZD5718/placebo and additionally receive dapagliflozin 10 mg/day."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study; participants and study team (including investigators) are blinded to AZD5718 vs placebo assignment throughout the study, with unblinding only in case of medical emergency."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT"", ""CARE_PROVIDER"", ""INVESTIGATOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 632, ""type"": ""ESTIMATED""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""AZD5718 Low Dose"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Participants receive a low dose of oral AZD5718 once daily for 12 weeks in addition to their usual treatments, followed by the same AZD5718 regimen plus dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily for 8 weeks."", ""interventionNames"": [""AZD5718"", ""Dapagliflozin""]}, {""label"": ""AZD5718 Medium Dose"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Participants receive a medium dose of oral AZD5718 once daily for 12 weeks in addition to their usual treatments, followed by the same AZD5718 regimen plus dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily for 8 weeks."", ""interventionNames"": [""AZD5718"", ""Dapagliflozin""]}, {""label"": ""AZD5718 High Dose"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Participants receive a high dose of oral AZD5718 once daily for 12 weeks in addition to their usual treatments, followed by the same AZD5718 regimen plus dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily for 8 weeks."", ""interventionNames"": [""AZD5718"", ""Dapagliflozin""]}, {""label"": ""Placebo"", ""type"": ""PLACEBO_COMPARATOR"", ""description"": ""Participants receive matching placebo tablets once daily for 12 weeks in addition to their usual treatments, followed by the same placebo regimen plus dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily for 8 weeks."", ""interventionNames"": [""Placebo"", ""Dapagliflozin""]}], ""interventions"": [{""type"": ""DRUG"", ""name"": ""AZD5718"", ""description"": ""AZD5718 is a potent, selective, and reversible 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) inhibitor that suppresses leukotriene production.

About 50 parent–child pairs, with children aged 2–6 years who have a clinically diagnosed developmental disability, will be randomly assigned to receive either OPC or a comparison intervention of structured parent consultation, while continuing any usual care such as early intervention or therapy. OPC is grounded in self-determination theory and aims to improve children’s participation in community activities by coaching parents to set goals, problem-solve, and implement strategies in everyday contexts. Outcomes will be measured at four time points from baseline to 8–9 weeks after the intervention, focusing primarily on child community participation and goal performance, and secondarily on parenting competence, parent emotional health, child quality of life, and child functional performance. The study will determine the feasibility (recruitment, retention, adherence, fidelity, blinding), acceptability (parent and coach interviews), and initial efficacy of OPC to inform a future full-scale efficacy trial."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This study is a Phase 1 feasibility and pilot randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate Occupational Performance Coaching (OPC) for parents of young children with developmental disabilities (DD) in Hong Kong. High rates of restricted community participation are reported among young children with DD, and existing early intervention services in Hong Kong primarily target children’s skills (e.g., motor, self-care) rather than their participation in community life. OPC is a family-centered, enablement-focused coaching model grounded in self-determination theory that seeks to enhance children’s participation in everyday life by working through parents as agents of change.\n\nThe trial will use a two-arm, parallel-group, double-blind design. Approximately 50 parent–child dyads will be recruited from early intervention services and the community (via posters and social media) across Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories. Eligible participants are parents (main caregivers with ≥50% caregiving responsibility) of children aged 2–6 years with a clinical diagnosis of a developmental disability (including, but not limited to, intellectual disability, developmental delay, or autism spectrum disorder). Parents must be able to converse in Chinese and wish to improve their child’s participation in four community activities identified from the Young Children’s Participation and Environment Measure (YC-PEM). Children with DD combined with significant physical (e.g., cerebral palsy, spina bifida, amputation) or sensory impairments (e.g., blindness, deafness) are excluded to maintain a relatively homogeneous group regarding community participation needs.\n\nParticipants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the OPC intervention group or the control group using block randomization stratified by whether the child is awaiting or currently receiving early intervention services. Randomization will be computer-generated and conducted by an independent research assistant. Parents and outcome assessors will be blinded to group allocation. Children in both groups will continue to receive usual care (e.g., occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech therapy, center-based training, or be on a waiting list), and parents will complete a therapy-activity log to document the type and dosage of concurrent services.\n\nIn the OPC group, parents will receive 4–8 sessions of coaching delivered weekly or fortnightly, each lasting 30–60 minutes, either in person or via telecommunication methods (e.g., telephone, Zoom, WhatsApp). OPC is structured around three enabling domains: (1) Connect—building a trusting, empathic relationship with parents; (2) Structure—guiding parents through a problem-solving process that includes setting goals, exploring options, planning and carrying out actions, and reviewing performance; and (3) Share—eliciting and valuing parents’ knowledge to support their autonomy. A core technique is collaborative performance analysis, in which the coach and parent jointly explore the current situation, desired outcomes, barriers and facilitators, and required actions for goal achievement. The focus is on enhancing children’s participation, particularly in community activities, through environmental and activity adaptations and parent-led strategy implementation. OPC will be delivered by occupational therapists with at least two years of pediatric/parent experience who have received at least 24 hours of formal OPC training (workshops and mentoring). Intervention fidelity will be monitored using the Occupational Performance Coaching Fidelity Measure Version 3.0, with a minimum acceptable fidelity threshold of 80% per session. Coaching sessions will be audio-recorded for fidelity checks, and ongoing supervision will be provided when self-rated fidelity falls below 80%.\n\nParents in the control group will receive 4–8 sessions of parent consultation of comparable frequency and duration (30–60 minutes), delivered in person or via tele-format. This consultation focuses on providing information about community resources (e.g., public playgrounds, play groups, sports programs) and generic supportive strategies for parents of children with disabilities. A structured toolbox compiled by the research team will guide the consultations. Therapists or occupational therapy students who are not trained in OPC will deliver this intervention using a direct informing approach: they will supply information about environmental resources and strategies, discuss the parents’ current situation and problems, and, if needed, provide basic information about disability and developmental milestones. OPC-specific elements—such as structured action–reflection processes and collaborative performance analysis—will be deliberately avoided. These providers will receive a 2-hour training on the toolbox and consultation procedures and will attend regular supervision sessions.\n\nThe trial has three main objectives: (1) to assess feasibility (recruitment rates, retention, adherence, success of blinding, and intervention fidelity) against predefined criteria; (2) to explore the acceptability of OPC to parents and coaches through qualitative interviews; and (3) to obtain preliminary estimates of OPC’s efficacy, compared to parent consultation, in improving children’s community participation and related outcomes.\n\nAssessments will occur at four time points: (a) 5–6 weeks before intervention (baseline, Time 0); (b) 1–2 weeks before intervention (pre-intervention, Time 1); (c) 1–2 weeks after intervention completion (post-intervention, Time 2); and (d) 8–9 weeks after intervention completion (follow-up, Time 3). The primary outcome measures focus on child participation: (1) the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM), used to identify and rate individualized participation goals in any life domain, with special attention to goals related to community participation for analysis; and (2) the community section of the Young Children’s Participation and Environment Measure (YC-PEM), which assesses the frequency and involvement of the child in 11 community activities and captures parent desire for change. The environmental support scale within the YC-PEM will also be used as an exploratory measure of perceived environmental facilitators and barriers in community settings.\n\nSecondary outcomes target both parents and children. Parent-focused measures include the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale (PSOC) to assess parenting efficacy and satisfaction, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) to evaluate parental emotional distress. Child-focused secondary outcomes include the Kiddy-KINDL (parent-report version) to assess health-related quality of life, particularly psychosocial aspects, and selected domains of the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer-Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT)—daily activities and social/cognitive function—to capture functional performance. Additional exploratory measures will examine mechanisms aligned with self-determination theory: the Session Rating Scale (SRS) to assess therapeutic alliance, and a modified Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ) to measure perceived autonomy support from the coach. A one-item Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) will capture parents’ overall perception of changes in their child’s community participation.\n\nFeasibility will be evaluated against predefined criteria, including target recruitment within a specific timeframe, retention rates, session attendance, successful blinding (assessed by asking parents and assessors to guess group allocation), and OPC fidelity scores. The OPC Fidelity Measure Version 3.0, which comprises 18 items across relationship, goal, reflection, analysis and action, client response, and distinguishing domains, will be applied to audio recordings of a subset of sessions per coach.\n\nAcceptability will be explored via semi-structured interviews with parents in the OPC arm after intervention (Time 2) and with OPC coaches at the end of the study. Parent interviews will address satisfaction with OPC (e.g., alliance, scheduling, duration), perceived learning, likes and dislikes, challenges, and perceived impact on their child’s community participation. Coach interviews will explore their experiences delivering OPC, perceived effectiveness, challenges, views on optimal scheduling/duration, and cultural appropriateness in Hong Kong. Parent transcripts will be analyzed using inductive thematic analysis, and coach transcripts using conventional content analysis. Credibility will be enhanced through code–recode checks, peer debriefing, and team discussions.\n\nFor initial efficacy analyses, repeated-measures ANCOVA will be used to compare changes from pre-intervention to post-intervention and follow-up between the OPC and control groups, adjusting for baseline scores (Time 0), treatment dosage, and mode of delivery. Only community-related COPM goals will be included in the primary participation analysis. Intent-to-treat principles will be applied, with last observation carried forward for missing follow-up data. Effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals will be reported to support sample size calculation for a future definitive RCT. Baseline group differences will be examined with t-tests or Mann–Whitney U tests and chi-square tests as appropriate, and data transformations will be applied if normality assumptions are violated.\n\nThe study anticipates potential challenges, including possible improvements in both groups attributable to goal setting before intervention, differential attrition (particularly if some parents prefer expert-led consultation over coaching), and external constraints on community participation due to public health measures (e.g., COVID-19 restrictions). The investigators plan to model baseline-to-pre-intervention changes, offer structured options for partial withdrawal (e.g., from intervention only but not from follow-up assessments), and closely monitor external restrictions to adjust recruitment or terminate the trial early if necessary.

One hundred adults with elevated blood pressure identified during their preadmission testing for surgery were randomized to either brief counseling plus an educational brochure about hypertension or the same counseling and brochure plus provision of a home blood pressure monitor with feedback of home readings. At about 60 days after surgery, participants were contacted to determine if they had seen their primary care provider, whether hypertension treatment had been started or adjusted, and how satisfied they were with the interventions. The study found that both preoperative counseling and home blood pressure monitoring were acceptable to patients, home monitoring was completed and devices were largely returned, and many patients had primary care follow-up and treatment changes. However, telephone follow-up had substantial loss to follow-up, suggesting that future larger trials may need to rely more on electronic health record data."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This prospective, randomized feasibility trial was conducted at the Yale New Haven Hospital Preadmission Testing Clinic between November 2018 and November 2019. The primary aim was to assess the feasibility of a perioperative blood pressure intervention and the baseline rates of primary care follow-up after such interventions in adults presenting for elective surgery with elevated clinic blood pressure. Secondary aims included evaluating the practicality of home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) in this setting, determining the proportion of patients with confirmed hypertension at home, describing post-operative changes in hypertension management, and assessing patient satisfaction with the interventions.\n\nEligible participants were adults (>18 years) who could understand English and had a clinic blood pressure of at least 140 mmHg systolic or 90 mmHg diastolic, based on the mean of two automated oscillometric measurements taken 5 minutes apart at the preadmission visit. Exclusion criteria included inability or unwillingness to operate a brachial artery HBPM device, inability to provide informed consent, or a scheduled surgery date within 48 hours of the preoperative visit.\n\nAfter informed consent, participants completed a questionnaire including a validated measure of antihypertensive medication adherence. They were randomized 1:1, stratified by gender, into two arms. The counseling arm received brief counseling about their elevated blood pressure and the need for follow-up, followed by a mailed follow-up letter and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute brochure \""Your Guide to Lowering Blood Pressure,\"" which covers diet, exercise, lifestyle modification, and other strategies to improve blood pressure control. The HBPM arm received the same educational brochure at enrollment and an Omron MX3 model BP742 home blood pressure monitor. Participants in the HBPM group were instructed on device use and asked to obtain resting blood pressure measurements in the morning and evening each day from enrollment until the day of surgery, and to return the device on the surgery date. The HBPM devices stored up to 50 time-stamped readings.\n\nFor the purposes of this trial, sustained elevated home blood pressure was defined a priori as mean systolic home BP ≥135 mmHg or mean diastolic home BP ≥85 mmHg, based on prior literature linking similar HBPM thresholds to increased cardiovascular risk. Following surgery, HBPM participants received a mailed summary of their mean home blood pressure. Unless the home readings showed sustained normotension, these letters encouraged participants to follow up with their primary care physician (PCP) to discuss blood pressure management.\n\nAt 60 days post-surgery, investigators attempted telephone follow-up. The structured telephone questionnaire assessed: (a) whether the participant had seen a PCP; (b) whether new antihypertensive therapy had been initiated or existing therapy adjusted; and (c) patient satisfaction and perceived helpfulness of the brochure, HBPM (if applicable), and follow-up call, using Likert-type scales. If participants could not be reached after three call attempts, their electronic health record (EHR) was reviewed for evidence of PCP visits and hypertension treatment changes; if none were found, these outcomes were coded as missing.\n\nA total of 100 participants were enrolled (mean age ~65 years; 54% female). Baseline clinic blood pressures were in the mid-150s systolic and around 90 mmHg diastolic in both arms. Most participants already had a PCP and a prior diagnosis of hypertension, and approximately 80% were on antihypertensive medication with high self-reported adherence. Forty-nine participants were randomized to HBPM and 51 to counseling. Return of HBPM devices was high: 46 of 49 devices (94%) were returned, and the median number of home readings per participant was 26. Among those who returned monitors, 78% met the study’s definition of elevated home blood pressure, indicating that most patients with elevated preoperative clinic pressures also had sustained hypertension at home.\n\nAt 60 days, telephone contact was achieved for 31 of 51 (61%) counseling participants and 30 of 49 (61%) HBPM participants, highlighting substantial attrition with phone-based follow-up. Using both phone and EHR data, 71% of counseling patients and 73% of HBPM patients had seen their PCP postoperatively. Among those who had a PCP visit, the majority discussed hypertension management. Across the trial, 35 patients had new or adjusted antihypertensive treatment at follow-up (47% of those answering in the counseling group and 58% in the HBPM group), including initiation of medication in a subset who were not previously treated. This suggests that preoperative identification and counseling of patients with elevated blood pressure may stimulate ongoing hypertension management, though the study was not designed or powered to compare clinical outcomes between arms.\n\nPatient-reported acceptance of the interventions was high. Among 61 participants reached by phone, 85% were neutral to very satisfied with their involvement in the study. Most respondents recalled the NIH brochure and reported implementing diet and exercise changes consistent with its recommendations, though these self-reports may include continuation rather than initiation of behaviors. Participants in the HBPM arm overwhelmingly rated the device as easy to use, although about 15% described HBPM use around the time of surgery as an added stressor.\n\nThe investigators concluded that randomized blood pressure interventions in the preoperative clinic are feasible, that HBPM can be implemented with high adherence and high device return, and that both interventions are generally well accepted by patients. However, the added diagnostic value of preoperative-period HBPM over preoperative clinic blood pressure measurements remains uncertain, especially given that most patients with elevated clinic BP also had elevated home readings. The study also underscored the limitations of telephone follow-up, which resulted in a 39% failure to reach participants, and suggested that future larger pragmatic studies may need to emphasize EHR-based outcome ascertainment, particularly within integrated health systems.\n\nThe trial population had higher than average primary care engagement and antihypertensive treatment and adherence compared with the general U.S. population, which may limit generalizability. Additional limitations include exclusion of non-English speakers and potential unmeasured language barriers, as well as recruitment challenges inherent in coordinating with busy preadmission workflows. Overall, the study supports the feasibility and acceptability of preoperative hypertension screening and counseling, and it provides data to inform the design, recruitment strategies, and follow-up methods for larger trials aimed at improving long-term cardiovascular risk management in surgical patients with hypertension."", ""conditionsModule"": {""conditions"": [""Hypertension"", ""Preoperative Care"", ""Blood Pressure"", ""Cardiovascular Diseases""], ""keywords"": [""Hypertension"", ""High Blood Pressure"", ""Preoperative Clinic"", ""Preadmission Testing"", ""Home Blood Pressure Monitoring"", ""HBPM"", ""Blood Pressure Screening"", ""Primary Care Follow-Up"", ""Antihypertensive Agents"", ""Medication Adherence"", ""Cardiovascular Risk"", ""Perioperative Care""]}}","{""conditions"": [""Hypertension"", ""Preoperative Care"", ""Blood Pressure"", ""Cardiovascular Diseases""], ""keywords"": [""Hypertension"", ""High Blood Pressure"", ""Preoperative Clinic"", ""Preadmission Testing"", ""Home Blood Pressure Monitoring"", ""HBPM"", ""Blood Pressure Screening"", ""Primary Care Follow-Up"", ""Antihypertensive Agents"", ""Medication Adherence"", ""Cardiovascular Risk"", ""Perioperative Care""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Prospective randomized 1:1 feasibility trial comparing brief blood pressure counseling plus educational brochure versus the same counseling/brochure plus home blood pressure monitoring with mailed report in preoperative clinic patients."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Open-label feasibility trial; participants and investigators were aware of group assignment (counseling vs home blood pressure monitoring)."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 100, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Counseling and Educational Brochure"", ""type"": ""ACTIVE_COMPARATOR"", ""description"": ""Participants received brief counseling in the preadmission testing clinic regarding their apparent hypertension and the importance of blood pressure follow-up.

The main hypothesis was that pairing an acutely reinforcing dopaminergic/noradrenergic agent (MPH) with escitalopram would enhance formation of a medication-taking habit and increase adherence, measured by pill counts and electronic monitoring. Bayesian mixed-effects models showed no evidence that MPH improved adherence; if anything, adherence was slightly higher in the placebo group. Both groups showed clinically meaningful improvements in depressive symptoms, and attitudes toward medication and sociodemographic factors did not significantly affect adherence. The study concluded that low-dose MPH does not improve adherence to antidepressant medication in this population."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This study addressed the problem of poor adherence to antidepressant pharmacotherapy in individuals with moderate to severe depression. Non-adherence is common in mental health care and is associated with worse clinical outcomes and higher health care costs.

Study drugs were compounded into identical capsules and dispensed in Medication Electronic Monitoring System (MEMS) bottles. At week 4, the treating psychiatrist could increase escitalopram to 20 mg (with either placebo or MPH maintained at 5 mg) in cases of insufficient clinical improvement. Medication was prescribed for 8 weeks, with in-person visits at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 8 and telephone contacts at weeks 1, 3, and 6. Usual care could continue, but new treatments were not permitted during the trial.\n\nThe primary endpoint was adherence assessed by pill count, defined as percent of prescribed doses taken over the interval between visits: 100 × (pills dispensed − pills remaining) / days between dispensing and return. The secondary endpoint was adherence measured using the MEMS caps, defined (per the STAR*D protocol) as the percentage of doses taken within ±25% of the expected dosing interval, operationalized as ±6 hours around an individualized expected time derived from participants’ dosing patterns. Exploratory endpoints included depressive symptom severity on the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology – Self-Report (QIDS-SR), remission (QIDS-SR ≤5), response (≥50% symptom reduction), and attitudinal measures from the Beliefs About Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ), examining whether medication beliefs influenced adherence.\n\nA Bayesian linear mixed-effects modeling framework was used for analysis. Fixed effects included treatment (MPH vs placebo), visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, with random intercepts for participants. For adherence outcomes, visits at weeks 2, 4, and 8 were modeled; the contrast of interest was the between-group difference at week 8. For QIDS-SR, visits at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 were modeled, and the main contrast was the difference between treatments in change from baseline to week 8. Analyses were performed with weakly informative default priors (rstanarm package) and, for adherence outcomes, also with informative priors encoding a prior belief that MPH would outperform placebo. Posterior distributions, credible intervals, and posterior probabilities that MPH adherence exceeded placebo adherence were estimated. Participants who withdrew or were lost to follow-up were retained in intention-to-treat analyses and coded as non-adherent for subsequent scheduled observations.\n\nAll 20 randomized participants (10 per arm) received the allocated treatment and were included in the primary and secondary endpoint analyses. Four participants discontinued early (three due to medication side effects—two in the MPH arm, one in the placebo arm—and one MPH participant due to missed appointments). No serious adverse events were reported. Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics, including QIDS-SR scores, did not differ significantly between groups.\n\nAdherence by pill count was high in both arms (overall averages approximately 89% for placebo and 76% for MPH across visits). Due to skewed distributions, adherence percentages were analyzed on a logit scale. The estimated marginal means showed slightly lower adherence for the MPH group over time. Posterior contrasts indicated that at week 8 the probability that MPH would produce higher adherence than placebo was below 15% with weakly informative priors and about 25% with informative priors, providing no evidence that MPH improved adherence. Placebo adherence was, on average, about 7–8 percentage points higher than MPH on the primary outcome.\n\nMEMS-based adherence results were consistent with the pill-count findings. Estimated trajectories showed similar adherence between groups at weeks 2 and 4, with slightly lower adherence in the MPH group at week 8. The posterior probability that MPH yielded higher MEMS adherence than placebo at week 8 was under 21% with default priors and approximately 36% with informative priors, again failing to support superiority of MPH.\n\nRegarding depressive symptoms, both treatment arms exhibited substantial QIDS-SR score reductions over the 8-week period, with a median decrease of approximately 8.6 points across groups. The Bayesian model suggested that the change in QIDS-SR from baseline to week 8 in the MPH group was on average 1.2 points lower than in the placebo group, but the 95% credible interval ranged from MPH being modestly worse to modestly better (approximately +2.1 to −4.5 points), indicating no clear between-group difference in antidepressant response. Thus, the lack of an adherence benefit with MPH did not appear to be due to inadequate antidepressant efficacy overall.\n\nExploratory analyses examined whether participants’ beliefs about medicines (BMQ general harm and overuse subscales), age, or sex explained variability in adherence. These covariates did not meaningfully alter the primary or secondary outcome conclusions, and BMQ measures showed negligible associations with adherence in this small sample, despite prior literature indicating that necessity-concerns beliefs often predict adherence in larger cohorts.\n\nThe study was originally designed as a two-stage program (pilot stage 1 with 20 participants, followed by stage 2 with an additional 80 participants) with group sequential monitoring and pre-specified stopping rules. After completion of stage 1, Bayesian results indicated that the observed adherence patterns were opposite to the primary hypothesis and that the posterior probability of clinically meaningful superiority of MPH over placebo was low. On this basis, the trial was terminated after the pilot phase, and stage 2 was not initiated.\n\nThe investigators concluded that low-dose MPH augmentation of escitalopram does not improve short-term medication adherence in adults with moderate to severe major depressive disorder and that the probability of benefit is low enough to discourage a larger confirmatory trial under the same conditions. The authors discussed potential explanations, including the already high adherence rates in this controlled research setting, the relatively low MPH dose, and the limited 8-week follow-up, as well as the broader difficulty of designing effective adherence-enhancing interventions. They emphasized that, while dopamine-mediated reinforcement mechanisms are theoretically relevant to habit formation, this specific pharmacologic strategy did not yield practical gains in adherence in the studied population.""}","{""conditions"": [""Major Depressive Disorder"", ""Depressive Disorder"", ""Medication Adherence""], ""keywords"": [""Major Depressive Disorder"", ""Depression"", ""Escitalopram"", ""Methylphenidate"", ""Medication Adherence"", ""Treatment Adherence and Compliance"", ""Habit Formation"", ""Dopamine"", ""Norepinephrine"", ""Antidepressive Agents"", ""Randomized Controlled Trial"", ""Bayesian Analysis""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Two-arm, parallel-group trial randomizing participants 1:1 to escitalopram plus methylphenidate versus escitalopram plus placebo, with optional escitalopram dose increase at week 4."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Participants and all study physicians, nurses, and research assistants who worked directly with participants were blinded to treatment allocation; only the study statistician and one staff member coordinating with the pharmacy were unblinded."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT"", ""CARE_PROVIDER"", ""INVESTIGATOR"", ""OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 20, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Placebo + Escitalopram"", ""type"": ""PLACEBO_COMPARATOR"", ""description"": ""Participants received a compound capsule containing placebo 5 mg plus escitalopram 10 mg daily for 8 weeks, with an option at week 4 to increase escitalopram to 20 mg (still combined with placebo).

Forty‑seven healthy adults were experimentally infected with fully virulent Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor Inaba strain N16961 in an inpatient controlled human infection model. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 500 mg iOWH032 or matching placebo by mouth every 8 hours for 3 days, starting at onset of diarrhea or 48 hours after challenge, whichever came first. All participants subsequently received ciprofloxacin beginning day 4 post‑challenge or earlier if they met criteria for severe diarrhea. The primary objective was to assess whether iOWH032 reduced diarrheal stool output rate compared with placebo; secondary objectives included effects on diarrhea severity, duration, and other clinical and microbiological outcomes, as well as safety and pharmacokinetics. iOWH032 was generally safe and achieved plasma levels above its in vitro CFTR IC50, but did not significantly reduce diarrheal stool output, diarrhea severity, or other clinical endpoints versus placebo, and therefore was not considered suitable for further development as a cholera treatment."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This was a randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, parallel‑group, group‑sequential Phase 2a study designed to test the clinical efficacy and safety of iOWH032, an oral cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel inhibitor, in a cholera controlled human infection model (CHIM). Cholera is an acute secretory diarrheal disease caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae, in which cholera toxin activates cAMP signaling and stimulates CFTR‑mediated chloride and water secretion into the intestinal lumen, leading to severe watery diarrhea. iOWH032, a synthetic small molecule with an oxadiazole‑carboxamide core and dibromo‑hydroxyphenyl pharmacophore, was developed as a host‑directed antisecretory therapeutic to reduce fluid loss in cholera and other CFTR‑mediated secretory diarrheas.\n\nThe trial was conducted at a single inpatient clinical research unit in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. Healthy adults aged 18–44 years without prior recent cholera infection or vaccination were enrolled. Participants were experimentally challenged with 10^6 colony‑forming units of wild‑type V. cholerae O1 El Tor Inaba strain N16961, administered orally in sodium bicarbonate solution after a brief fast. This dose and challenge model have been previously used to evaluate cholera vaccines and reliably induce acute watery diarrhea within 18–48 hours in susceptible individuals.\n\nThe study was conducted in two sequential cohorts with an interim analysis for safety and preliminary efficacy after completion of the first cohort. Randomization was 1:1 to iOWH032 or matching placebo, stratified by blood type O versus non‑O because of known increased susceptibility and severity in blood group O. Study treatment began at the onset of diarrhea (first loose stool of prespecified grade) or at 48 hours after challenge, whichever occurred first. Participants received 500 mg iOWH032 (two 250 mg immediate‑release tablets) or two matching placebo tablets orally approximately every 8 hours for 3 consecutive days (nine total doses). Ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily for 3 days was instituted at 4 days post‑challenge, earlier if participants met criteria for severe cholera (>5 L cumulative diarrheal stool), or per investigator discretion; asymptomatic participants received ciprofloxacin 1–2 hours after the last iOWH032/placebo dose. All participants were managed with standard oral rehydration solution and/or intravenous fluids based on clinical need.\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was diarrheal stool output rate, defined as total volume of diarrheal stools (predefined as grade 3 or higher consistency) divided by the number of hours between initiation of study drug dosing and initiation of antimicrobial therapy. The principal analysis used a modified intent‑to‑treat (mITT) population including challenged participants who received at least one dose of study drug and developed diarrhea (grade ≥3) within 48 hours of challenge. Randomization was stratified by blood type, and the primary analysis used the Van Elteren test (a stratified Wilcoxon rank‑sum test) to compare treatment groups. A group‑sequential design with pre‑specified efficacy and futility boundaries at interim analysis controlled the overall one‑sided type I error at 0.025 and targeted ≥90% power to detect an approximately 50% reduction in stool output rate, based on preclinical data from mouse closed‑loop and rat models and assumptions of uniform diarrhea volume distributions.\n\nKey secondary endpoints included: proportion of participants with moderate (3–5 L) or severe (>5 L) diarrhea; total diarrheal stool volume and area under the curve; time to first formed stool; number of loose stools; occurrence of fever and vomiting; need for oral rehydration solution and/or intravenous fluids; and microbiological endpoints such as time to cessation of detectable V. cholerae in stool, area under the curve and peak levels of bacterial shedding. Safety assessments comprised treatment‑emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), vital signs, laboratory tests, and electrocardiograms. Pharmacokinetic sampling for iOWH032 was performed 7±1 hours after the first and ninth doses to obtain troughish plasma concentrations.\n\nAmong 47 challenged participants, 36 met mITT criteria (16 iOWH032, 20 placebo); others either had no loose stools or diarrhea onset after 48 hours. In the mITT population, the median (95% CI) diarrheal stool output rate was 25.4 mL/hour (8.9, 58.3) for iOWH032 versus 32.6 mL/hour (15.8, 48.2) for placebo, corresponding to a 23% reduction that was not statistically significant (Van Elteren p = 0.2254). By blood group, median output rates were similar between iOWH032 and placebo in type O participants, whereas non‑O participants showed a numerically lower median in the iOWH032 group, but the study was not powered to evaluate these subgroup differences. When participants with symptom onset after 48 hours were included, the estimated reduction in stool output rate fell to about 13% and remained non‑significant.\n\nFor the secondary endpoint of diarrhea severity, 43.8% of iOWH032 recipients and 55% of placebo recipients in the mITT population developed moderate or severe diarrhea (>3 L output), and there was no statistically significant difference between groups (Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel p = 0.5145). There were also no significant differences in the proportion with severe diarrhea (>5 L), in median area under the curve of diarrheal stool volume, time to first formed stool, number of loose stools, occurrence of fever or vomiting, or use of oral rehydration or intravenous fluids. One iOWH032‑treated subject and four placebo‑treated subjects received intravenous fluids.\n\nMicrobiologically, the median time to cessation of detectable V. cholerae in stool was initially statistically longer in the iOWH032 group, but this apparent difference was driven by a higher proportion of early antibiotic initiation in the placebo group; after excluding those who received early antibiotics, the difference was small and not significant. There were no meaningful differences between groups in bacterial shedding AUC or peak shedding. iOWH032 plasma concentrations exceeded the in vitro CFTR IC50 (~2,725 ng/mL) after repeated dosing: mean concentrations were approximately 2,250 ng/mL 7 hours after the first dose and 4,270 ng/mL 7 hours after dose 9, indicating accumulation over the 3‑day regimen. Only a weak negative correlation was observed between plasma levels and stool output rate.\n\niOWH032 was generally safe and well tolerated. Study drug–related TEAEs were infrequent and mostly mild gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, abdominal discomfort, vomiting). Overall TEAEs, including those related to cholera challenge, were common but similar between groups. No participant discontinued study drug due to adverse events, and there were no deaths. One SAE (pyelonephritis) occurred in a placebo‑treated participant during follow‑up and was deemed unrelated to study treatment.\n\nDespite adequate systemic exposure and a favorable safety profile, iOWH032 did not demonstrate clinically or statistically significant reductions in stool volume, diarrhea severity, or other key clinical endpoints in this cholera CHIM. Potential explanations discussed by the investigators include inadequate luminal drug concentrations at the intestinal CFTR target due to poor aqueous solubility, rapid intestinal transit and convective washout during acute secretory diarrhea, and limitations on dosing frequency imposed by the target product profile. The study also highlighted methodological considerations for future therapeutic CHIMs, including timing of treatment initiation relative to symptom onset, feasible sample sizes, and the magnitude of effect considered clinically meaningful.\n\nThe investigators concluded that iOWH032 does not warrant further development as a cholera treatment, although they noted the compound may have potential in other CFTR‑related disease settings. This trial represents the first use of a cholera controlled human infection model to evaluate a therapeutic candidate rather than a vaccine and provides a framework and lessons learned for future development and proof‑of‑concept testing of host‑directed antisecretory agents in infectious diarrhea.\n\nThe trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT04150250.""}","{""conditions"": [""Cholera"", ""Vibrio cholerae infection"", ""Acute Watery Diarrhea"", ""Secretory Diarrhea""], ""keywords"": [""Cholera"", ""Vibrio cholerae"", ""Vibrio cholerae O1"", ""El Tor biotype"", ""Inaba serotype"", ""Acute Diarrhea"", ""Secretory Diarrhea"", ""Infectious Diarrhea"", ""CFTR"", ""Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator"", ""Antisecretory Agents"", ""Host-directed therapy"", ""Small Molecule Inhibitors"", ""iOWH032"", ""Controlled Human Infection Model"", ""Human Challenge Study"", ""Randomized Controlled Trial"", ""Ciprofloxacin"", ""Oral Rehydration Therapy""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, group-sequential Phase 2a study in a cholera controlled human infection model with two sequential cohorts."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""QUADRUPLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Double-blind trial in which participants, clinical staff/care providers, the investigator, and sponsor personnel were blinded to treatment allocation; only the site pharmacist was unblinded for drug preparation and dispensing."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT"", ""CARE_PROVIDER"", ""INVESTIGATOR"", ""OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 47, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""iOWH032"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Participants experimentally infected with Vibrio cholerae El Tor Inaba strain N16961 and treated with oral iOWH032 500 mg (two 250 mg immediate-release tablets) approximately every 8 hours for 3 consecutive days, starting at onset of diarrhea symptoms or 48 hours after cholera challenge (whichever came first).

Key exclusions included recent surgery (within 2 weeks), prior cranial radiotherapy, placement of a Gliadel wafer, and concurrent investigational drugs.\n\nTwo treatment regimens were investigated:\n- Regimen M: afatinib plus temozolomide in combination with radiotherapy in patients initially selected for methylated MGMT promoter status.\n- Regimen U: afatinib plus radiotherapy without temozolomide in patients initially selected for unmethylated MGMT promoter status.\n\nAfter evidence emerged that temozolomide is beneficial regardless of MGMT status, the protocol was amended so that, once the MTD was defined for regimen U, all subsequent patients received regimen M irrespective of MGMT methylation.\n\nIn both regimens, external‑beam radiotherapy was delivered at 2 Gy per fraction, 5 days per week for 6 weeks (total 60 Gy). Afatinib was given orally once daily in escalating cohorts of 20, 30, and 40 mg during the 6‑week radiotherapy phase, and then continued at 40 mg/day as maintenance until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In regimen M, patients also received temozolomide 75 mg/m² daily during radiotherapy, followed by a 4‑week break, then up to six 28‑day cycles of maintenance temozolomide (150 mg/m² in cycle 1 and 200 mg/m² in cycles 2–6, days 1–5 of each cycle).\n\nDose‑limiting toxicities (DLTs) were predefined adverse events or laboratory abnormalities attributed to afatinib occurring during the 6‑week radiotherapy phase. If a DLT occurred, afatinib was interrupted and could be resumed at a reduced dose if toxicity resolved to baseline or CTCAE grade 1 within 14 days; otherwise, afatinib was discontinued. The MTD was defined as the highest afatinib dose at which no more than one of six evaluable patients experienced a DLT (DLT incidence ≤17%). Patients missing substantial afatinib exposure during radiotherapy for reasons other than DLT were replaced for MTD assessment.\n\nThe primary endpoint was determination of the MTD of continuous daily afatinib in combination with radiotherapy, with or without concomitant temozolomide. Secondary endpoints included incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs, objective tumor response by Macdonald criteria on serial MRI, and pharmacokinetics of afatinib at steady state (trough levels on days 8, 15, and 29). Time to disease progression (TTP) was analyzed post hoc using Kaplan–Meier methods.\n\nOf 55 enrolled patients, 36 received at least one dose of study medication (regimen M: n=20; regimen U: n=16) and were included in safety and efficacy analyses. In regimen M, afatinib 20 mg and then 40 mg were initially tested; DLTs at 40 mg (grade 4 thrombocytopenia and grade 3 vomiting) led to evaluation of an intermediate 30‑mg dose, at which no DLTs occurred. Thus, the MTD for afatinib with radiotherapy plus daily temozolomide was 30 mg/day during radiotherapy (with 40 mg/day as post‑RT maintenance). In regimen U, afatinib was escalated from 20 mg to 40 mg; with only one DLT (grade 3 diarrhea) among six evaluable patients at 40 mg, the MTD for afatinib with radiotherapy alone was 40 mg/day.\n\nToxicities were consistent with the known profiles of afatinib, radiotherapy, and temozolomide. The most frequent AEs in both regimens were diarrhea and rash, with nausea prominent in the temozolomide‑containing regimen. A high proportion of patients experienced drug‑related AEs, and afatinib was discontinued in a substantial minority due to toxicity or progression. Grade ≥3 treatment‑related events and serious AEs were common, but no new safety signals were identified. In regimen U, three fatal AEs (bacterial meningitis, pneumonia, and disease progression) occurred but were not considered related to afatinib.\n\nAlthough efficacy was not a primary objective, preliminary activity was observed. In the temozolomide‑containing regimen (M), 25% of patients achieved an objective response (including one complete response) and 55% achieved stable disease; median time to progression was 434 days (95% CI 205–not estimable). In the radiotherapy‑only regimen (U), 6% of patients had an objective response and 50% had stable disease; median time to progression was 211 days (95% CI 101–not estimable). It is not possible to attribute this activity specifically to afatinib given the concurrent standard therapies.\n\nThe study concludes that afatinib can be combined with standard radiotherapy (with or without temozolomide) in newly diagnosed GBM at MTDs of 30 mg/day (with concomitant temozolomide) and 40 mg/day (without temozolomide), with a manageable safety profile and pharmacokinetics similar to single‑agent afatinib. Given the modest overall efficacy of ErbB inhibitors in unselected GBM and the association of EGFR alterations with afatinib benefit in prior work, the authors emphasize the need for biomarker‑based patient selection (e.g., EGFR amplification or specific EGFR mutations) in future GBM trials of afatinib and related agents.""}","{""conditions"": [""Glioblastoma"", ""Glioblastoma Multiforme"", ""Malignant Glioma"", ""Brain Neoplasms"", ""Glioma""], ""keywords"": [""Glioblastoma multiforme"", ""GBM"", ""Malignant glioma"", ""Brain tumor"", ""Brain neoplasms"", ""Radiotherapy"", ""Radiation therapy"", ""Temozolomide"", ""Afatinib"", ""ErbB inhibitor"", ""EGFR"", ""Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor"", ""HER2"", ""ErbB family"", ""EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor"", ""TKI"", ""MGMT promoter methylation"", ""O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase"", ""Central nervous system neoplasms"", ""Phase I clinical trial"", ""Dose escalation"", ""Maximum tolerated dose"", ""Macdonald criteria""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE1""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""NON_RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Phase I, open-label, 3+3 dose-escalation trial with two parallel treatment regimens based on MGMT promoter methylation status: regimen M (afatinib + temozolomide + radiotherapy) and regimen U (afatinib + radiotherapy)."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Open-label study; no blinding of participants or investigators."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 55, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Regimen M: Afatinib + Temozolomide + Radiotherapy"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Patients with newly diagnosed WHO grade 4 malignant glioma (initially with methylated MGMT promoter; later any MGMT status after protocol amendment) received external beam radiotherapy plus daily oral temozolomide and oral afatinib during the 6‑week RT phase, followed by maintenance afatinib and temozolomide.

Five groups were studied: MenABCWY alone (two doses); 4CMenB plus MenACWY given together in the same arm (two doses); 4CMenB plus MenACWY given in different arms (two doses); 4CMenB alone (two doses); and MenACWY alone (one dose). The main aim was to assess whether combining these antigens in MenABCWY or giving 4CMenB and MenACWY together causes immune interference, particularly for serogroup B responses, measured by human serum bactericidal assay (hSBA). The study found no substantial immunological interference between 4CMenB and MenACWY components for pooled serogroup B strains and showed that MenABCWY had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This phase 2, randomized, open-label study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03587207) was conducted at 16 centers in the Czech Republic between July and December 2018 to investigate an investigational meningococcal ABCWY vaccine (MenABCWY) in healthy individuals aged 10 to 25 years. MenABCWY is a combined vaccine designed to provide protection against invasive meningococcal disease due to serogroups A, B, C, W, and Y by including antigens from two licensed vaccines: 4CMenB (Bexsero, GSK) and MenACWY-CRM (Menveo, GSK). The rationale is to simplify the vaccination schedule and potentially improve coverage by offering a single product covering five major serogroups.\n\nA total of 500 participants were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 into five groups: (1) two doses of MenABCWY; (2) two doses of 4CMenB plus MenACWY administered concomitantly in the same arm (4CMenB+ACWY/S); (3) two doses of 4CMenB plus MenACWY administered concomitantly in different arms (4CMenB+ACWY/D); (4) two doses of 4CMenB alone; and (5) a single dose of MenACWY alone. Doses in the two-dose regimens were given 2 months apart (days 1 and 61), with blood sampling before vaccination and 1 month after each dose (days 1, 31, and 91 for two-dose groups; days 1 and 31 for the MenACWY-only group). Participants were stratified by age (10–17 years and 18–25 years). Key exclusion criteria included prior meningococcal vaccination, history of meningococcal disease, contact with meningococcal disease within 60 days, significant immune or blood disorders, immune-mediated disease, recent immunoglobulin or blood product receipt, recent investigational product use, significant neurological disorders or seizures, and pregnancy or breastfeeding.\n\nMenABCWY was prepared by reconstituting a lyophilized CRM197-conjugated oligosaccharide component (serogroups A, C, W, Y) with a liquid suspension containing recombinant serogroup B proteins (NadA, fHbp, NHBA) and outer membrane vesicle (OMV) components from serogroup B strain NZ98/254. Each 0.5 mL MenABCWY dose contained 10 μg MenA-CRM197, 5 μg each of MenC-, MenW-, and MenY-CRM197, 50 μg of each MenB recombinant protein, 25 μg OMV, and 1.5 mg aluminum hydroxide. MenACWY-CRM contained 10 μg MenA-CRM197 and 5 μg each of MenC-, MenW-, and MenY-CRM197 in a two-component lyophilized/liquid formulation. 4CMenB contained 50 μg of each MenB recombinant protein, 25 μg OMV, and 1.5 mg aluminum hydroxide. Vaccines were administered intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle; in the 4CMenB+ACWY/S group, both injections were in different sites of the same (nondominant) arm; in the 4CMenB+ACWY/D group, 4CMenB was injected in the nondominant arm and MenACWY in the dominant arm.\n\nThe primary objective was to assess immune responses one month after the last scheduled vaccination, focusing on potential immune interference among vaccine antigens. Immunogenicity was evaluated by human serum bactericidal assay (hSBA) against pooled serogroup B test strains representing the main 4CMenB/MenABCWY antigens (fHbp, NadA, PorA, NHBA) and against serogroups A, C, W, and Y. For serogroup B, the panel included strain M14459 (fHbp v1.1), 96217 (NadA), NZ98/254 (PorA P1.4), and M07-0241084 (NHBA). Outcomes included hSBA geometric mean titers (GMTs), the proportion of subjects with hSBA titers at or above the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), and the proportion achieving at least a 4-fold increase from baseline. GMT ratios (postvaccination to baseline) were also calculated. The study was powered to detect potential global immune interference in pooled serogroup B responses when vaccines were given concomitantly in the same arm versus different arms, assuming a possible lymph node \""stress\"" effect. An ANCOVA model was used for pooled serogroup B GMTs, with study group, center, and strain as fixed effects and log-transformed baseline titer as a covariate. The 4CMenB+ACWY/S group was considered statistically inferior to 4CMenB+ACWY/D if the two-sided 80% confidence interval for the GMT ratio was entirely below 1. Differences between MenABCWY and 4CMenB+ACWY/S were examined descriptively; the study was not powered for detailed per-strain comparisons.\n\nOne month after the second dose, hSBA GMTs against pooled serogroup B strains were similar in the 4CMenB+ACWY/S and 4CMenB+ACWY/D groups, with a GMT ratio of 0.96 (80% CI, 0.83–1.10), indicating no evidence of substantial immunological interference due to same-arm administration. The MenABCWY group had somewhat lower pooled serogroup B GMTs (31.84; 80% CI, 28.18–35.98) than the 4CMenB+ACWY/S (38.48; 80% CI, 34.23–43.26) and 4CMenB+ACWY/D (40.08; 80% CI, 35.44–45.33) groups, and lower than the 4CMenB group (42.38; 80% CI, 37.31–48.13), with a MenABCWY vs 4CMenB+ACWY/S GMT ratio of 0.83 (80% CI, 0.72–0.95). For individual serogroup B strains, responses were similar between the two 4CMenB+ACWY groups, but MenABCWY elicited lower responses to NadA, PorA, and NHBA compared with 4CMenB, and lower responses to PorA and NHBA compared with 4CMenB+ACWY/D. These differences were descriptive and the causes were not defined.\n\nFor serogroups A, C, W, and Y, GMTs after two doses of MenABCWY were generally similar to those after two doses of 4CMenB+MenACWY, except for serogroup A, where MenABCWY GMTs (104.90; 80% CI, 87.02–126.47) were lower than those in the 4CMenB+ACWY/S (187.52; 80% CI, 156.94–224.05) and 4CMenB+ACWY/D (204.01; 80% CI, 169.06–246.18) groups. A single dose of MenACWY elicited lower serogroup A, C, W, and Y responses than two doses of MenABCWY or 4CMenB+MenACWY. Across groups, proportions of subjects achieving titers ≥LLOQ and ≥4-fold increases for most serogroups and strains were similar, with some lower proportions in the MenABCWY group for specific antigens (notably serogroup A, PorA, and NHBA).\n\nSafety and reactogenicity were secondary endpoints. Participants were observed for 30 minutes after each vaccination and recorded solicited local (injection-site erythema, swelling, induration, pain) and systemic (arthralgia, fatigue, nausea, headache, myalgia, fever) adverse events (AEs) for 7 days post-dose using diary cards. Unsolicited AEs were recorded for 30 days after each dose. Medically attended AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), AEs leading to withdrawal, and arthritis (as an adverse event of special interest) were monitored throughout the study.\n\nSolicited local AEs were common and largely consistent across groups receiving two-dose schedules. After the first dose, 90.0–97.1% of participants in the MenABCWY, 4CMenB+ACWY/S, 4CMenB+ACWY/D, and 4CMenB groups reported at least one local AE, compared with 57.8% in the MenACWY-only group. Pain at the injection site was the most frequent local AE (approximately 89.0–96.2% after first doses and 87.0–95.0% after second doses in multi-component groups; 51.0% with single-dose MenACWY). Severe pain (preventing normal activity) occurred in 12.8–21.2% of participants after each dose in the multi-component groups and in 2.9% of MenACWY-only recipients.\n\nSolicited systemic AEs were reported by 64.9–70.2% of participants after first doses and 62.5–71.0% after second doses in the MenABCWY and 4CMenB±ACWY groups, and by 58.8% in the MenACWY-only group. The most frequent systemic AEs were fatigue (approximately 50–60% after first dose and 58–62% after second dose in multi-component groups, 50% in MenACWY-only) and headache (approximately 35–53% across groups). Most systemic AEs were mild or moderate; severe fatigue and severe headache were infrequent. Fever ≥38°C occurred in 1.1–6.0% of participants per group per dose; no fevers ≥40°C were reported.\n\nUnsolicited AEs within 30 days post-vaccination were reported in 23.0–26.0% of participants in the multi-component groups and in 14.7% of MenACWY-only recipients. Common unsolicited AEs included injection-site pain, injection-site induration, and upper respiratory tract infections. Medically attended unsolicited AEs occurred in 5.9–16.3% of participants across groups, with conditions such as upper respiratory tract infection, tonsillitis, viral infection, pharyngitis, ligament sprain, concussion, toothache, and syncope occurring in small numbers. Five SAEs were reported: two concussions (4CMenB+ACWY/S), two bone fractures (one in 4CMenB+ACWY/D, one in 4CMenB), and one syncope (4CMenB). Only the syncope, occurring one day after the last 4CMenB dose, was considered possibly or probably related to vaccination; the subject fully recovered. No cases of arthritis were reported, no participants withdrew because of AEs, and no deaths occurred.\n\nOverall, the study concluded that administering two doses of MenABCWY to healthy 10- to 25-year-olds does not appear to be associated with substantial immunological interference for pooled serogroup B test strains, and that concomitant administration of 4CMenB and MenACWY in the same or different arms does not materially alter serogroup B immune responses. MenABCWY showed an acceptable reactogenicity and safety profile, comparable to licensed comparators, supporting further clinical development of this combined meningococcal ABCWY vaccine.""}","{""conditions"": [""Meningococcal Infections"", ""Meningitis, Meningococcal"", ""Sepsis"", ""Neisseria meningitidis Infection"", ""Invasive Meningococcal Disease""], ""keywords"": [""Neisseria meningitidis"", ""Meningococcal vaccine"", ""Serogroup A meningococcal infection"", ""Serogroup B meningococcal infection"", ""Serogroup C meningococcal infection"", ""Serogroup W meningococcal infection"", ""Serogroup Y meningococcal infection"", ""4CMenB"", ""Bexsero"", ""MenACWY-CRM"", ""Menveo"", ""MenABCWY vaccine"", ""Serum bactericidal assay"", ""hSBA"", ""Outer membrane vesicles"", ""Factor H binding protein"", ""fHbp"", ""Neisserial adhesin A"", ""NadA"", ""Neisserial heparin binding antigen"", ""NHBA"", ""Adolescents"", ""Young adults"", ""Vaccine immunogenicity"", ""Vaccine safety"", ""Conjugate vaccines"", ""Quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Five-group, parallel-arm vaccine trial in which healthy participants aged 10–25 years were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive MenABCWY (2 doses), 4CMenB+MenACWY given concomitantly in the same arm (2 doses), 4CMenB+MenACWY given concomitantly in different arms (2 doses), 4CMenB alone (2 doses), or MenACWY alone (single dose)."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""PREVENTION"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Open-label study with no blinding of participants or investigators."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 500, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""MenABCWY"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Participants 10 to 25 years of age received two doses of the investigational MenABCWY vaccine administered intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle on study days 1 and 61."", ""interventionNames"": [""MenABCWY vaccine""]}, {""label"": ""4CMenB+ACWY/S"", ""type"": ""ACTIVE_COMPARATOR"", ""description"": ""Participants 10 to 25 years of age received two doses of licensed 4CMenB and MenACWY vaccines administered concomitantly in the same arm (4CMenB injected in the upper deltoid and MenACWY in the lower deltoid of the nondominant arm) on study days 1 and 61."", ""interventionNames"": [""4CMenB vaccine"", ""MenACWY-CRM vaccine""]}, {""label"": ""4CMenB+ACWY/D"", ""type"": ""ACTIVE_COMPARATOR"", ""description"": ""Participants 10 to 25 years of age received two doses of licensed 4CMenB and MenACWY vaccines administered concomitantly in different arms (4CMenB in the nondominant arm and MenACWY in the dominant arm) on study days 1 and 61."", ""interventionNames"": [""4CMenB vaccine"", ""MenACWY-CRM vaccine""]}, {""label"": ""4CMenB"", ""type"": ""ACTIVE_COMPARATOR"", ""description"": ""Participants 10 to 25 years of age received two doses of licensed 4CMenB vaccine administered intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle on study days 1 and 61."", ""interventionNames"": [""4CMenB vaccine""]}, {""label"": ""MenACWY"", ""type"": ""ACTIVE_COMPARATOR"", ""description"": ""Participants 10 to 25 years of age received a single dose of licensed MenACWY-CRM vaccine administered intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle on study day 1."", ""interventionNames"": [""MenACWY-CRM vaccine""]}], ""interventions"": [{""type"": ""BIOLOGICAL"", ""name"": ""MenABCWY vaccine"", ""description"": ""Investigational combined meningococcal ABCWY vaccine prepared by reconstituting lyophilized powder containing CRM197-conjugated oligosaccharides of meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y with a liquid suspension containing purified recombinant proteins from meningococcal serogroup B (NadA, fHbp, and NHBA) and outer membrane vesicle components from serogroup B strain NZ98/254.

One hundred adults who smoke at least 5 cigarettes per day and are motivated to quit wear a smartband for 60 days. For the first 21 days, the band monitors and detects smoking and notifies participants to increase awareness of their smoking patterns and triggers. For the next 7 days, a brief \""mindful smoking\"" exercise is sent whenever smoking is detected or manually reported. Around a quit date set at day 30, a brief mindfulness exercise called RAIN (recognize, allow, investigate, nonidentification) is delivered at times when smoking is predicted based on earlier tracking data to help participants work mindfully with cravings instead of smoking. The primary outcomes are feasibility measures (treatment fidelity, adherence, and acceptability); secondary outcomes include changes in cigarettes per day and short-term abstinence."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This is a single-arm, 60-day feasibility clinical trial evaluating the use of wearable and smartphone technology to monitor and detect smoking and to deliver brief mindfulness-based interventions in real time among daily smokers making a quit attempt. The intervention leverages a smartband developed by Somatix, Inc., which uses accelerometer and gyroscope data and a machine learning algorithm to identify individual smoking-related hand-to-mouth gestures and distinguish them from other movements. When 3–4 puffs consistent with smoking are detected, the paired smartphone app prompts the user to confirm or deny smoking and allows manual reporting of any undetected smoking events.\n\nA total of 100 adult participants (≥18 years) who smoke at least 5 cigarettes per day for at least 2 years, are fluent in English, own a compatible smartphone (iPhone or Android), and are motivated to quit (score ≥4 on a readiness-to-change item) are enrolled remotely following online recruitment (e.g., Facebook ads) and online informed consent. Participants are shipped a smartband and complete a video onboarding session to set up the device and app. They are instructed to wear the smartband for 12 waking hours per day over 60 days and to set a quit date at 30 days from study start.\n\nThe intervention has three sequential components:\n1. **Monitoring and awareness (days 1–21):** The smartband automatically monitors and detects smoking and sends immediate notifications via vibration and smartphone alerts when smoking is detected, prompting participants to confirm or deny the event. Participants are instructed to manually log any smoking not detected by the band. This phase is intended to increase awareness of smoking frequency, context, and triggers and to generate individual smoking profiles. Data from this period form the basis for later prediction of likely smoking times.\n\n2. **Mindful smoking (days 21–28):** After the day-21 survey, participants complete a brief mindfulness training adapted from the Craving to Quit app. This training introduces mindfulness and habit formation and provides a guided mindful smoking exercise designed to foster clear awareness of the immediate physical sensations, emotions, and thoughts associated with smoking, supporting the development of disenchantment with smoking. For the next 7 days, every detected or manually reported smoking event automatically triggers a text message with a link to a ~2-minute audio-guided mindful smoking exercise (with subtitles). Participants are instructed to use the exercise whenever they smoke but may access it at any time via SMS links. After each use, they rate how helpful they found the exercise on a visual analog scale (VAS).\n\n3. **RAIN for cravings and predicted smoking events (days 30–60):** Following the day-28 survey, participants receive another brief mindfulness training, again adapted from Craving to Quit, focusing on cravings conceptualized as transient experiences (e.g., craving as a tantrum toddler) and introducing urge surfing. The RAIN (recognize, allow, investigate, nonidentification) mindfulness practice is taught to help participants observe cues, cravings, and affective states, accept them without judgment, investigate their bodily, emotional, and cognitive components, and avoid overidentifying with them. For 30 days following the quit date (~days 30–60), participants receive SMS links to a 2-minute audio-guided RAIN exercise at times predicted to be high-risk for smoking based on individualized smoking data from the initial 21 days. A prediction algorithm runs every 5 minutes and flags times for RAIN delivery if at least one smoking event was previously observed within 15 minutes of that time window over the first 21 days, with a 45-minute cooldown to minimize message burden. Before and after each RAIN exercise, participants rate current craving and affect (VAS scales), and afterward they additionally rate helpfulness and timing (too early/too late). During this period, the smartband continues to detect smoking and trigger mindful smoking exercises whenever smoking is detected or manually reported.\n\nAdherence is supported through automated reminders if the band is worn less than 12 hours per day, additional SMS/email/phone reminders if non-wear persists 48–72 hours, and financial incentives for onboarding, survey completion (at days 21, 28, 60), daily wear, and overall completion. Encouraging SMS feedback summarizing the number of mindfulness exercises completed the prior day or week is sent during the mindful smoking week and throughout the first week and then weekly during the RAIN phase.\n\nThe **primary outcomes** are feasibility measures of treatment fidelity, adherence, and acceptability:\n- **Treatment fidelity** includes: (a) the percentage of smoking events accurately detected by the smartband and the false alarm rate during days 1–21; (b) the percentage of mindful smoking exercises correctly triggered by smoking events and associated false alarm rates during days 21–28; and (c) the timeliness of RAIN delivery to predicted smoking events during days 30–60, assessed by participant timing ratings and craving levels prior to RAIN use as a proxy for targeting high-craving moments. Feasibility criteria include achieving high detection accuracy (aiming to replicate >80% detection and negligible false alarms) and at least 75% of participants rating timeliness and craving as moderate or higher.\n- **Adherence** is measured by the proportion of days with ≥12 hours of smartband wear, the percentage of smoking notifications responded to (confirmed or denied), and the percentages of mindful smoking and RAIN exercises completed relative to those sent during their respective intervention periods. Based on preliminary data, an adherence cutoff of completing at least 80% of mindfulness exercises relative to baseline cigarettes per day is specified.\n- **Acceptability** is assessed through mean helpfulness ratings (VAS) for mindful smoking and RAIN, evaluated as the proportion of participants with ratings in the moderate-to-very-high range (feasibility defined as ≥75% meeting this threshold). Additional acceptability and usability data are collected via User Experiences Questionnaires at days 21, 28, and 60, which cover ease of use of the technology, technical burden (e.g., charging, pairing), perceived helpfulness and liking of the mindfulness exercises, and perceived effects on awareness, cravings, and smoking. The 60-day questionnaire includes items adapted from the User Burden Scale, System Usability Scale, Mobile Application Rating Scale, and the 4-item Acceptability of Intervention Measure.\n\nThe **secondary outcomes** are smoking behavior and abstinence. Cigarettes per day are assessed by self-report at baseline, days 21, 28, and 60, and by smartband-detected events. Timeline Followback is used at each survey to capture day-by-day smoking between assessments. One-week point prevalence abstinence at day 60 is measured by self-report, by absence of smartband-detected smoking in the preceding 7 days, and by biochemical verification (carbon monoxide <6 ppm) in up to 30 self-reported abstinent participants using mailed piCO+ Smokerlyzer devices and remote video verification. Continuous abstinence (fewer than 5 cigarettes since quit date) is assessed by self-report.\n\nExploratory measures include demographics, smoking characteristics (e.g., Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence, Minnesota Tobacco Withdrawal Scale), dispositional mindfulness (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire short form), and in-intervention ecological momentary assessment ratings of craving and affect. Statistical analyses will primarily be descriptive for feasibility endpoints, with proportions and 95% confidence intervals. Changes in cigarettes per day will be examined using mixed regression models incorporating both self-reported and smartband-detected data, with model selection based on Bayesian information criterion. Exploratory mediation analyses will examine whether changes in craving, affect, mindfulness, and related psychological variables may mediate changes in smoking.\n\nThe trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03995225). It is supported by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health and is intended to inform the design of future randomized efficacy trials of wearable- and smartphone-based mindfulness interventions for smoking cessation.""}","{""conditions"": [""Tobacco Use Disorder"", ""Smoking"", ""Cigarette Smoking"", ""Nicotine Dependence"", ""Smoking Cessation""], ""keywords"": [""Smoking"", ""Cigarette Smoking"", ""Tobacco Use Disorder"", ""Nicotine Dependence"", ""Smoking Cessation"", ""Mindfulness"", ""Mindfulness-Based Intervention"", ""Mobile Health"", ""mHealth"", ""Smartphone"", ""Mobile Applications"", ""Wearable Electronic Devices"", ""Smartband"", ""Ecological Momentary Assessment"", ""Craving"", ""Tobacco Withdrawal"", ""Carbon Monoxide"", ""Quit Attempts""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""NA"", ""interventionModel"": ""SINGLE_GROUP"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Single-arm feasibility clinical trial in which all enrolled daily smokers (N=100) receive the same 60-day smartband- and smartphone-based mindfulness intervention for smoking cessation without randomization or control group."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""DEVICE_FEASIBILITY"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Open-label feasibility study; participants and investigators are aware that all participants receive the smartband and mindfulness intervention."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 100, ""type"": ""ESTIMATED""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Smartband- and smartphone-based mindfulness smoking cessation intervention"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Single-arm feasibility trial in which all daily smokers (N=100) receive a 60-day intervention using a smartband and smartphone app. For days 1-21, participants wear a smartband 12 waking hours per day to automatically monitor and detect smoking and receive real-time notifications to confirm or deny smoking and to manually report undetected cigarettes.

Monocyte‑derived type‑1 polarized dendritic cells (αDC1) were loaded with HLA‑A2‑restricted TBVA peptides and injected intradermally every two weeks. Patients were randomized to start oral dasatinib (70 mg twice daily) either immediately with the first vaccine cycle (Arm B) or delayed to week 5 (Arm A). Primary endpoint was peripheral blood T‑cell response to vaccine peptides; secondary endpoints included objective clinical response, progression‑free and overall survival, and exploratory analyses of blood, tumor, and serum immune biomarkers. The combination was safe and induced coordinated vaccine‑specific and broader (epitope‑spreading) CD8+ T‑cell responses in a subset of patients, which correlated with partial responses or stable disease, TCR convergence, an inflamed tumor microenvironment, and features of tertiary lymphoid structure formation, with better outcomes in the immediate‑dasatinib arm."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This prospective, single‑center randomized pilot phase II clinical trial (UPCI 12‑048; NCT01876212) tested a combination immunotherapy strategy in HLA‑A2–positive patients with advanced stage (IIC–IV) cutaneous, mucosal, or uveal melanoma for whom standard curative or palliative options were exhausted or ineffective. Most enrolled patients had previously progressed on PD‑1–based immune checkpoint blockade. The investigational regimen consisted of autologous monocyte‑derived type‑1 polarized dendritic cells (αDC1) pulsed with a mixture of six HLA‑A2‑restricted peptides derived from overexpressed, non‑mutated tumor blood vessel antigens (TBVA: DLK1, EphA2, HBB, NRP1, RGS5, TEM1), administered intradermally near nodal basins in the extremities every two weeks, combined with the oral Src/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib at 70 mg twice daily.\n\nPatients were randomized to two arms differing only in dasatinib timing: Arm A received vaccine alone in cycle 1, followed by addition of dasatinib starting week 5 (cycle 2), whereas Arm B started dasatinib on day 1 of cycle 1 concurrently with vaccination. Each treatment cycle was one month, with vaccinations on days 1 and 15, and treatment continued for at least six cycles or until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or clinical deterioration. The trial was closed early due to expiration of grant support rather than safety concerns.\n\nThe primary endpoint was immunologic: induction of peripheral blood T‑cell responses to vaccine TBVA peptides assessed by standardized IFN‑γ ELISPOT. A positive immune response required a >2‑fold increase from baseline and ≥10 specific spots per 10^5 cells for at least three distinct vaccine peptides at any on‑treatment time point. Secondary endpoints included safety (CTCAE v4.0), investigator‑assessed objective clinical response (RECIST v1.1), objective response rate, progression‑free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and exploratory correlative studies of regulatory T cells and myeloid‑derived suppressor cells in blood, vascular and immune gene expression in tumor biopsies, and serum biomarkers such as CXCL10 and soluble checkpoint molecules. Tumor biopsies were obtained at baseline and at week 5, and peripheral blood was collected every two weeks.\n\nSixteen patients were accrued; 14 received at least one vaccination plus planned dasatinib, and 13 were evaluable for the primary and key secondary endpoints. Among these 13 patients, 6 developed vaccine‑specific CD8+ T‑cell responses to ≥3 TBVA peptides, often detectable by week 3 and fluctuating over time, and all six had preferred clinical outcomes (four partial responses and two stable disease). Seven patients failed to mount vaccine‑specific responses; these patients generally experienced progressive disease, with only one stable case. Patients in Arm B (immediate dasatinib) had higher immune response and objective response rates and longer median OS (about 15–19 months vs ~3–8 months) and PFS (~7.9 vs ~2 months) compared with Arm A (delayed dasatinib), suggesting that dasatinib acts as an in vivo adjuvant during the priming phase.\n\nThe study documented epitope spreading: in immunologic responders, CD8+ T‑cell reactivity broadened to non‑vaccine, disease‑relevant HLA‑A2‑restricted peptides derived from melanoma differentiation antigens (MART‑1, gp100, tyrosinase) and additional vascular antigens (NRP1, PDGFRβ, VEGFR1, VEGFR2). The extent and magnitude of responses to both vaccine and non‑vaccine peptides correlated with improved PFS and OS. High levels of T‑cell receptor (TCR) convergence in peripheral blood, at baseline and especially on treatment, were associated with vaccine responsiveness, longer PFS and OS, and partial responses, whereas overall TCR evenness (oligoclonality) was not predictive.\n\nSafety analysis showed that the combination regimen was generally well tolerated; no treatment‑related adverse events exceeded grade 3. The observed adverse events were consistent with the known profile of dasatinib (e.g., anemia, fatigue, hyponatremia, nausea, cytopenias, rash), with some events more frequent in the immediate‑dasatinib arm.\n\nExploratory correlative studies examined the αDC1 product, blood, and tumor microenvironment. Conventional phenotypic release markers of αDC1 (e.g., CD11c, CD80/83/86, CCR7, HLA‑DR, IL‑12/IL‑10 secretion) did not distinguish vaccines from responders versus non‑responders. However, gene expression profiling of vaccine αDC1 identified transcriptional signatures enriched in responders, including genes linked to mature antigen‑presenting cell function, type I/II interferon signaling, lymphoid organization, and cell survival (e.g., GM‑CSF, LAMP3, RELB, BTNL8, CXCR3, IRF3, LTB, TRAF1/2), and depletion of genes associated with immature or tolerogenic DC, apoptosis, or immunosuppression (e.g., CD47, IL18BP, LAIR, PTGER2, RGS5, TGFBI). These patterns suggest functional heterogeneity of autologous DC vaccines that may affect clinical efficacy.\n\nTumor biopsies profiled using the Oncomine Immune Response Research Assay and a custom NanoString panel revealed that baseline tumors from responders exhibited an inflamed, immunologically \""hot\"" phenotype, with higher expression of antigen presentation and costimulation molecules (CD80, CD86, HLA‑DMB, ICOSLG), chemokines and receptors linked to immune cell recruitment (CCL3, CCR5, CMKLR1), and innate and adaptive immune effector markers (e.g., NK cell receptors NCR1, NCR3, KIR2DL2, cytotoxic granule components). In contrast, poor‑outcome tumors expressed higher levels of genes linked to hypoxia/acidosis (CA4) and anti‑apoptotic pathways (BCL2). On treatment, responders showed transcriptional shifts consistent with decreased hypoxia/glycolysis (lower HIF1A, IRS1), increased infiltration by diverse immune subsets (B cells, monocytes, macrophages, NK cells, secretory/cytotoxic cells), and reduced expression of genes promoting tumor proliferation, DNA repair, metastasis, and immune suppression in non‑responders.\n\nA notable finding was the emergence, only in responding patients, of a tumor transcriptional biosignature indicative of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), including increased expression of CCL19, CCL21, LTA, LTB, TNFSF14, CXCL10, IFNG, CD8A, CD20, CHST4, FUT4, LAMP3, TBX21, and CD274/PD‑L1. Although histologic confirmation was not feasible due to limited tissue, this TLS‑like signature strongly correlated with epitope spreading in peripheral CD8+ T cells and better survival, suggesting that successful vaccination plus dasatinib can remodel the tumor microenvironment to support local priming and diversification of antitumor T‑cell responses.\n\nThe study concludes that vaccination against non‑mutated tumor blood vessel antigens using autologous αDC1, combined with dasatinib as a systemic immune and microenvironmental modulator, is safe, immunogenic, and shows promising clinical activity in heavily pretreated, largely checkpoint‑refractory advanced melanoma, particularly when dasatinib is started concurrently with vaccination. The data support further evaluation of this strategy, including in planned phase II trials in melanoma and clear‑cell renal cell carcinoma, and highlight TCR convergence, epitope spreading, DC transcriptomic signatures, and TLS‑associated tumor profiles as potential biomarkers of response.""}","{""conditions"": [""Melanoma"", ""Cutaneous Melanoma"", ""Mucosal Melanoma"", ""Uveal Melanoma"", ""Stage III Melanoma"", ""Stage IV Melanoma""], ""keywords"": [""Melanoma"", ""Advanced Melanoma"", ""Cutaneous Melanoma"", ""Mucosal Melanoma"", ""Uveal Melanoma"", ""Tumor Blood Vessel Antigens"", ""DLK1"", ""EPHA2"", ""Hemoglobin beta chain"", ""NRP1"", ""RGS5"", ""TEM1"", ""Dendritic Cell Vaccine"", ""Type-1 Polarized Dendritic Cells"", ""αDC1"", ""Cancer Vaccines"", ""Dasatinib"", ""Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors"", ""Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Resistance"", ""PD-1 Resistance"", ""CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes"", ""T-Cell Receptor Repertoire"", ""TCR Convergence"", ""Epitope Spreading"", ""Tumor Microenvironment"", ""Tertiary Lymphoid Structures"", ""Vascular Normalization"", ""Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells"", ""Regulatory T-Lymphocytes"", ""CXCL10"", ""Immunotherapy"", ""Phase II Clinical Trial"", ""HLA-A2 Positive""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Single-center, first-in-human randomized pilot phase II trial with two parallel treatment arms: Arm A received autologous αDC1/TBVA peptide vaccine plus dasatinib starting in week 5; Arm B received the same vaccine plus dasatinib starting in week 1."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""No mention of blinding; study conducted as an open-label randomized trial comparing immediate versus delayed dasatinib in combination with vaccine."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 16, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Arm A: Vaccine + Delayed Dasatinib"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Patients received autologous type-1-polarized dendritic cell (αDC1) vaccine loaded with six HLA-A2-presented tumor blood vessel antigen peptides (DLK1, EphA2, HBB, NRP1, RGS5, TEM1) administered as a single intradermal injection of approximately 10^7 cells on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle.

In Part A, participants received single ascending oral doses of 1–40 mg GSK3358699 or placebo in a crossover design to characterize systemic exposure, intracellular metabolite levels in monocytes, and ex vivo inhibition of lipopolysaccharide‑induced cytokines. Part C was a planned 14‑day repeat‑dose phase with 10 mg GSK3358699 or placebo once daily, but it was terminated early due to clinically significant cardiac adverse events, including atrial fibrillation and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Single doses were generally well tolerated and produced measurable concentrations of the active metabolite GSK3206944 in target cells, but no suitable repeat‑dose regimen could be identified."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This phase 1, randomized, double‑blind (sponsor‑open), first‑in‑human clinical study (NCT03426995) investigated GSK3358699, an esterase‑sensitive motif‑containing bromodomain and extra‑terminal domain (BET) family inhibitor designed to preferentially target mononuclear‑myeloid lineage cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. GSK3358699 is hydrolyzed by human carboxylesterase‑1 (CES‑1) within these cells to form the pharmacologically active acid metabolite GSK3206944, which is retained intracellularly and, together with the parent compound, functions as a potent BET inhibitor. The development concept was to achieve targeted BET inhibition in myeloid cells to modulate inflammatory pathways while mitigating the dose‑limiting toxicities (thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal symptoms, QTc prolongation) seen with pan‑BET inhibitors.\n\nHealthy male volunteers (18–56 years, body weight ≥50 kg, BMI 18.5–35.0 kg/m²) without significant cardiovascular, metabolic, hepatic, renal, respiratory, or gastrointestinal disease and without clinically important ECG abnormalities were enrolled. The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability, including adverse events, clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, 12‑lead ECGs, and continuous cardiac telemetry. Secondary and exploratory objectives included characterization of the systemic pharmacokinetics of GSK3358699 and GSK3206944, quantification of GSK3206944 in isolated monocytes, and assessment of pharmacodynamic effects on ex vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‑stimulated cytokine production (MCP‑1, IL‑6, TNF‑α).\n\nPart A used a single ascending‑dose, two‑cohort interlocking crossover design in 23 participants. Each participant could receive up to two different single oral doses of GSK3358699 (1, 3, 10, 20, 30, or 40 mg) and one placebo dose, with at least a 28‑day washout between active treatments. Dose escalation decisions were made by a Dose Escalation Committee, with predefined pharmacokinetic and safety stopping criteria. An additional exploratory period in Part A evaluated a 25‑mg dose combined with in vivo LPS or GM‑CSF challenge and cantharidin‑induced blisters; those immunologic challenge data are reported separately. Plasma pharmacokinetics were characterized up to 48 hours post‑dose. Monocyte intracellular GSK3206944 concentrations were measured using CD14‑positive cell isolation. Ex vivo pharmacodynamic activity was assessed by incubating whole blood in TruCulture LPS tubes and quantifying MCP‑1, IL‑6, and TNF‑α.\n\nIn Part A, exposure to GSK3358699 and GSK3206944 generally increased with dose. Cmax increased approximately dose‑proportionally, while AUC parameters increased more than dose‑proportionally across 1–40 mg. Plasma GSK3358699 was typically quantifiable up to 12 hours after doses ≤20 mg and up to 24 hours after doses ≥25 mg; GSK3206944 was quantifiable up to 24–48 hours at higher doses. Median initial half‑lives were about 0.7–1.1 hours for GSK3358699 and 2.1–2.9 hours for GSK3206944, with apparent terminal half‑lives of approximately 5–7 hours at doses ≥25 mg. Intracellular GSK3206944 in monocytes was quantifiable at 1 hour after 10 mg and at 1 and 4 hours after 20–40 mg, but not beyond 8 hours, confirming target‑cell delivery while showing relatively short intracellular persistence.\n\nEx vivo LPS‑stimulated pharmacodynamic data in Part A showed dose‑dependent inhibition of MCP‑1 at 1 hour post‑dose, with mean predicted inhibition reaching about 75% at 40 mg. However, inhibition was not sustained at 4 hours and there was no consistent inhibition of IL‑6 or TNF‑α. High inter‑ and intra‑participant variability in cytokine responses limited interpretability. Null control tubes showed minimal cytokine levels, indicating variability was not due to pre‑existing activation or assay contamination.\n\nPart C was designed as a repeat‑dose portion in healthy males, initially planned as four sequential cohorts with once‑daily oral GSK3358699 or placebo for 14 days. The starting dose was 10 mg QD, selected from Part A data as a conservative initial regimen unlikely to produce high levels of target engagement. Participants were to undergo ex vivo pharmacodynamic assessments and, in later cohorts, in vivo LPS or GM‑CSF challenges similar to Part A. Following cardiac safety concerns during the first repeat‑dose cohort (cohort 4), the design was amended to balance GSK3358699 and placebo 1:1, remove in vivo challenges from cohorts 5–7, and move these immunologic procedures to a planned cohort 8. The study was ultimately terminated during cohort 5, and cohorts 6–8 were not conducted.\n\nIn Part C, 25 participants (11 placebo, 14 GSK3358699) were randomized to 10 mg GSK3358699 or placebo QD for up to 14 days; only two participants per arm (sentinel subjects in cohorts 4 and 5) completed all 14 doses. Plasma pharmacokinetics after the first 10‑mg dose in Part C were consistent with single‑dose results from Part A. Limited day‑14 data precluded reliable estimation of accumulation. Intracellular monocyte GSK3206944 concentrations after 10 mg repeat dosing did not show clear enhancement compared with single dosing.\n\nAcross both parts, the most common adverse event was headache. Single doses up to 40 mg were generally well tolerated, with primarily mild to moderate adverse events and no serious adverse events in Part A. However, clinically significant cardiac events emerged across the study. In total, four episodes of asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) occurred in GSK3358699‑treated participants (two in Part A, two in Part C), and two episodes of atrial fibrillation (AF) occurred in Part C (one brief nonsustained AF in a placebo recipient and one sustained AF in a GSK3358699 recipient). The NSVT episodes led to a temporary halt of cohort 4 while an independent cardiology panel reviewed the data; these events were judged consistent with background NSVT incidence in healthy adults and not clearly drug‑related, allowing study restart. The sustained AF in the GSK3358699‑treated participant required hospitalization and electrical cardioversion, fulfilled protocol stopping rules, and led to permanent study termination. No subject exhibited clinically significant QTc prolongation, and routine safety labs and imaging showed no overt myocardial damage.\n\nIn parallel 3‑month GLP toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys, troponin elevations and cardiac histopathology were observed at exposures overlapping the clinical range, whereas 1‑month studies had not shown these findings. Considering these nonclinical data alongside the human AF and NSVT events, a causal relationship between GSK3358699 and cardiac toxicity could not be excluded. This substantially reduced the acceptable safety margin and effectively limited further clinical exploration to doses (≤5 mg) unlikely to achieve robust target engagement, especially given the variable and limited pharmacodynamic signal.\n\nOverall, the study demonstrated that GSK3358699 is orally bioavailable, delivers its active metabolite GSK3206944 into mononuclear myeloid cells, and at single doses up to 40 mg largely avoids the thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal toxicity, and QTc prolongation reported with pan‑BET inhibitors. Nevertheless, the totality of emerging cardiac safety signals in humans and animals, coupled with limited and variable pharmacodynamic effects in ex vivo cytokine assays, led to the conclusion that an acceptable therapeutic window could not be defined, and clinical development of GSK3358699 was discontinued.""}","{""conditions"": [""Healthy Volunteers""], ""keywords"": [""Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal Domain"", ""BET inhibitor"", ""Epigenetic regulation"", ""Myeloid Cells"", ""Monocytes"", ""Macrophages"", ""Dendritic Cells"", ""Inflammation"", ""Inflammatory Diseases"", ""Rheumatoid Arthritis"", ""Psoriasis"", ""Liver Fibrosis"", ""Inflammatory Bowel Diseases"", ""Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1"", ""Interleukin-6"", ""Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"", ""Lipopolysaccharides"", ""Cardiac Arrhythmias"", ""Atrial Fibrillation"", ""Ventricular Tachycardia"", ""Phase I Clinical Trial""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE1""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""SEQUENTIAL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Three-part, randomized, double-blind (sponsor-open) phase 1 study in healthy male volunteers.

XR-NTX is a monthly intramuscular injection that blocks opioid effects but requires that patients be opioid-free for several days prior to induction to avoid precipitated withdrawal.\n\nBecause earlier work showed that many participants randomized to XR-NTX failed to complete induction, this sub-study sought to characterize, in depth, the experiences of individuals assigned to XR-NTX with respect to opioid withdrawal and induction. A convenience sample of 37 of the 55 participants randomized to XR-NTX was interviewed between 2018 and 2019, including 20 who successfully completed XR-NTX induction and 17 who did not. Participants were adults with HIV and moderate or severe OUD and unsuppressed HIV viral load (≥200 copies/mL) at enrollment. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted in person or by telephone, digitally recorded, professionally transcribed, and analyzed using constructivist thematic analysis following Braun and Clarke’s six-step approach. Three experienced qualitative researchers developed and refined the coding scheme, achieved inter-coder reliability (85% on 10% of transcripts), and identified key themes related to withdrawal and XR-NTX induction.\n\nAmong participants who successfully completed XR-NTX induction, themes included (1) a strong readiness or motivation for change (e.g., desire for a better life, concern for family, prior overdose experiences), (2) undergoing withdrawal in a supportive environment, particularly inpatient medically managed withdrawal settings with access to comfort medications and a controlled environment away from drug use triggers, and (3) caring and flexible interactions with clinic and study staff who provided education, emotional support, assistance with logistics such as child care, and medications to alleviate withdrawal symptoms.\n\nIn contrast, among those who did not complete XR-NTX induction, four contrasting themes emerged: (1) concern and anxiety about opioid withdrawal, often rooted in past negative withdrawal experiences and exacerbated by homelessness or lack of structured settings, with particular difficulty when fentanyl exposure was present; (2) ambivalence about or reluctance to stop opioids, including recognition of perceived benefits of opioids such as pain relief or coping with psychosocial stressors; (3) concerns and misperceptions about XR-NTX itself, including fear of precipitated withdrawal, unmanaged pain, persistent cravings, compensatory use of other substances (e.g., stimulants), or overdose if opioids were used while on XR-NTX; and (4) preference for alternative medications such as methadone or buprenorphine, especially when participants had prior positive experiences or were started on these medications during medically supervised withdrawal and chose to remain on them.\n\nThe study highlights that successful XR-NTX induction among people with HIV and OUD is facilitated by patient readiness to change, access to safe and supportive withdrawal management (ideally inpatient with ancillary medications), and strong therapeutic relationships with staff. Barriers include fear of withdrawal, particularly in the context of fentanyl use, insufficient structural support (e.g., homelessness, lack of access to detox facilities), ongoing ambivalence about abstinence from opioids, negative or conflicting information about XR-NTX, and strong preferences for agonist therapies. The findings support the importance of shared decision-making, motivational interventions, better management of opioid and fentanyl withdrawal (including comfort medications and appropriate settings), and clear patient education about XR-NTX versus agonist medications. They also underscore the need for targeted strategies to improve XR-NTX initiation in high-need populations such as individuals living with uncontrolled HIV and OUD.""}","{""conditions"": [""Opioid-Related Disorders"", ""HIV Infections"", ""Substance-Related Disorders"", ""Opioid Withdrawal"", ""Heroin Dependence"", ""Fentanyl"", ""Alcohol-Related Disorders""], ""keywords"": [""Opioid Use Disorder"", ""OUD"", ""HIV"", ""Human Immunodeficiency Virus"", ""Medications for Opioid Use Disorder"", ""MOUD"", ""Extended-Release Naltrexone"", ""XR-NTX"", ""Naltrexone"", ""Opioid Agonist Therapy"", ""Buprenorphine"", ""Methadone"", ""Opioid Antagonists"", ""Medication-Assisted Treatment"", ""Opioid Withdrawal"", ""Fentanyl"", ""Heroin"", ""Inpatient Detoxification"", ""Medically Managed Withdrawal"", ""Qualitative Research"", ""Randomized Controlled Trial"", ""Treatment as Usual"", ""Motivational Interviewing"", ""Shared Decision Making"", ""HIV Care Continuum"", ""Antiretroviral Therapy Adherence"", ""Viral Suppression""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Participants with HIV and opioid use disorder were randomized in HIV clinics to extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), which requires complete cessation of opioid use, versus treatment-as-usual with opioid agonist/partial agonist therapy (buprenorphine or methadone).

Participants who reacted to less than 50 mg of peanut protein were randomized 3.5:1 to receive omalizumab or placebo for 12 weeks, followed by rapid escalation to 250 mg peanut protein on the first day of desensitization, weekly up-dosing over 8 weeks to a maximum of 2000 mg, continuation of omalizumab or placebo for 19 weeks, and then continuation of OIT alone. At 52 weeks (about 8 months after omalizumab discontinuation), many subjects tolerated substantially higher peanut doses than at baseline. Sera from 15 peanut-allergic participants at baseline (week 0) and after OIT (week 52), as well as sera from non-allergic controls, were analyzed.\n\nTo characterize fine specificity of peanut-directed humoral responses, the investigators developed AllerScan, a phage immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-seq)–based platform tailored to peanut allergens. The peanut AllerScan library comprises 397 overlapping 20-mer peptides tiling every 10 amino acids across 12 WHO/IUIS-recognized peanut allergens (Ara h 1–Ara h 17 where applicable), along with saturation mutagenesis variants in which each position is substituted with all other amino acids. The library was cloned into a T7 phage-display vector and quality-controlled by deep sequencing. For each serum sample, phage displaying the peptide library were incubated with serum, and either human IgE or IgG was immunoprecipitated using biotinylated anti-IgE or anti-IgG antibodies plus streptavidin magnetic beads. Bound phage were sequenced, and peptide-level enrichments were quantified as Z-scores relative to mock immunoprecipitations.\n\nUsing baseline peanut-allergic sera, the study mapped linear IgE and IgG epitopes across peanut allergens and identified strongly immunodominant \""public\"" epitopes—peptides recognized by IgE from a large fraction of allergic subjects—especially in Ara h 1, Ara h 2, Ara h 3, and Ara h 7. Many previously reported linear IgE epitopes were recapitulated, validating the method. In contrast, non-allergic donors showed no detectable peanut-specific IgE and only limited, largely distinct IgG reactivity, including one IgG epitope in Ara h 3 that was relatively common in non-allergic but not in allergic subjects. Saturation mutagenesis data were used to derive substitution effects and \""high-resolution antibody footprints\"" for each epitope, revealing critical residues needed for binding. For most public epitopes, different allergic individuals shared highly similar patterns of critical residues, suggesting convergent or public antibody solutions to peanut allergens.\n\nThe longitudinal analysis compared epitope repertoires and binding intensities before and after 52 weeks of OIT. IgE epitope diversity (number of distinct peptides recognized) remained essentially unchanged, although levels of pre-existing IgE specificities generally declined, consistent with an overall decrease in total peanut-specific IgE. In contrast, IgG responses showed a marked expansion in breadth and magnitude; the number of IgG-reactive peptides per subject roughly doubled, and seroprevalence and Z-scores for many epitopes increased. The overlap between IgE and IgG epitope sets increased after OIT, and new IgG epitopes emerged that were not targeted by IgE. A particularly notable finding was a strong induction of Ara h 7–specific IgG, with many more subjects exhibiting IgG binding to Ara h 7 peptides post-OIT, and large increases in peptide-specific Z-scores.\n\nBy comparing saturation-mutagenesis footprints for shared epitopes, the study observed that, within individuals, OIT-induced IgG and pre-existing IgE frequently displayed highly similar or nearly identical residue-level binding patterns. Across 39 shared epitopes, most IgE-IgG footprint correlations within the same subject exceeded 0.75. This suggests that IgE and IgG antibodies may be clonally related or arise through convergent affinity maturation toward the same linear epitope, and that OIT preferentially expands IgG+ B cell lineages related to or targeting the same immunodominant sites as IgE.\n\nThe authors propose that the robust induction and diversification of peanut-specific IgG, combined with reduced levels of pre-existing IgE, could contribute to clinical desensitization through multiple mechanisms: direct competition with IgE for allergen binding (steric hindrance at shared epitopes), formation of immune complexes enhancing allergen clearance, and engagement of inhibitory FcγRIIb receptors on mast cells and basophils. They also note that the pattern of public epitopes and individual variability in epitope recognition could be exploited for personalized immunotherapy—for example, by designing peptide-based vaccines focused on \""missing\"" public epitopes to elicit protective IgG with minimal risk of IgE-mediated reactions.\n\nLimitations highlighted include the focus on linear peptides, which may underrepresent conformational or discontinuous epitopes important for peanut allergy, and the inability of this serologic approach to directly resolve B cell receptor sequences or definitively distinguish clonal relationships versus convergent responses. Nevertheless, the study demonstrates that AllerScan can capture high-resolution maps of IgE and IgG epitope repertoires in allergic patients and track their evolution during oral immunotherapy.""}","{""conditions"": [""Peanut Hypersensitivity"", ""Food Hypersensitivity"", ""Anaphylaxis"", ""Child"", ""Oral Immunotherapy""], ""keywords"": [""Peanut allergy"", ""Ara h 1"", ""Ara h 2"", ""Ara h 3"", ""Ara h 7"", ""Immunoglobulin E"", ""Immunoglobulin G"", ""Epitope Mapping"", ""Phage Display"", ""PhIP-seq"", ""Oral Immunotherapy"", ""Omalizumab"", ""Desensitization, Immunologic"", ""Basophils"", ""Mast Cells"", ""Fc epsilon RI"", ""Fc gamma RIIb"", ""Food Allergy"", ""Children""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Multicenter randomized placebo-controlled study of oral peanut desensitization under cover of anti-IgE (omalizumab) versus placebo, followed by oral immunotherapy; placebo subjects failing to reach the target dose could cross over to open-label omalizumab."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Participants were randomized 3.5:1 to receive either omalizumab or placebo for 12 weeks in a placebo-controlled design; masking details beyond this are not specified."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 10, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Omalizumab plus Peanut Oral Immunotherapy"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Highly peanut-allergic subjects first received omalizumab (anti-IgE) for 12 weeks, then underwent rapid escalation on the first day of desensitization to 250 mg peanut protein followed by weekly up-dosing over 8 weeks to a maximum maintenance dose of 2000 mg peanut protein; omalizumab or placebo was continued for a total of 19 weeks, after which only oral immunotherapy with peanut was continued through week 52."", ""interventionNames"": [""Omalizumab"", ""Peanut Oral Immunotherapy""]}, {""label"": ""Placebo plus Peanut Oral Immunotherapy"", ""type"": ""PLACEBO_COMPARATOR"", ""description"": ""Highly peanut-allergic subjects received placebo instead of omalizumab for 12 weeks, then underwent rapid escalation on the first day of desensitization to 250 mg peanut protein followed by weekly up-dosing over 8 weeks to a maximum maintenance dose of 2000 mg peanut protein; placebo or omalizumab was continued for a total of 19 weeks, after which only oral immunotherapy with peanut was continued through week 52.

All participants had a documented suboptimal response to one or two prior DMTs. Suboptimal response was defined as at least one clinical relapse, or at least one T1‑weighted gadolinium‑enhancing lesion, or at least two new or enlarging T2‑weighted hyperintense lesions on MRI while receiving a stable dose of a DMT for at least 6 months; for patients on the same DMT for more than 1 year, these events had to occur within the last 12 months. Patients could be enrolled based solely on MRI activity, clinical relapse, or both.

The first 600 mg dose was administered as two 300 mg infusions separated by 14 days.

NEDA was defined as absence of: (i) protocol‑defined relapse (PDR; new or worsening neurological symptoms attributed to MS), (ii) 24‑week confirmed disability progression (CDP; increase in EDSS by ≥1.0 point from baseline), (iii) T1‑weighted gadolinium‑enhancing contrast‑enhancing lesions (CELs), and (iv) new and/or enlarging T2‑weighted hyperintense lesions. Patients who discontinued early for lack of efficacy or death were imputed as having a disease‑activity event.\n\nKey secondary endpoints included: NEDA during the first 24‑week and 48‑week intervals; time to first event of any NEDA component; time to first PDR; time to first CDP; time to first new/enlarging T2 lesion; mean change in EDSS from baseline to Week 96; proportions of patients with CDP, stable disability, or confirmed disability improvement (CDI; EDSS decrease ≥1.0 in those with baseline EDSS ≥2); annualized relapse rate (ARR) at Week 96; total number and adjusted rates of CELs and new/enlarging T2 lesions; changes in T2 lesion volume; and percentage changes in whole‑brain volume, white matter volume, and cortical gray matter volume from Week 8 using standardized MRI analysis methods (SIENA/X and paired Jacobian integration). Subgroup analyses were prespecified for demographics (age), disease characteristics (baseline EDSS, relapse history, timing of qualifying event), enrollment reason (MRI only, relapse only, both), and prior/last DMT type (interferon‑based therapies, glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, natalizumab). Exploratory endpoints included NEDA without re‑baselining (MRI from screening), epoch‑specific NEDA (Year 1 vs Year 2), and predictors of NEDA using logistic regression.\n\nThe study enrolled 680 treated patients across 157 centers. Most (60.4%) had received one prior DMT and 39.6% two DMTs. About one quarter (24.6%) were enrolled based on MRI activity alone, while others were enrolled for relapse alone or relapse plus MRI activity. Interferon‑based regimens were the most common prior DMT. The mean time from last DMT to first ocrelizumab dose was about 1.9 months.\n\nIn the modified intention‑to‑treat population, 74.8% (492/658; 95% CI 71.3–78.0) of patients achieved NEDA at Week 96 when MRI was re‑baselined at Week 8. Clinical NEDA (no relapse, no CDP) was seen in 80.4%, and MRI NEDA (no CELs and no new/enlarging T2 lesions) in 91.5%. NEDA rates were similar in the per‑protocol population. NEDA during the first 24 and 48 weeks was also high (87.1% and 82.6%, respectively). More patients had NEDA in Year 2 than Year 1.\n\nSubgroup analyses showed the highest NEDA rate in patients enrolled for MRI activity only, in those with baseline EDSS <2.5, with ≤1 relapse prior to enrollment, and in patients with the qualifying event ≥6 months before study entry. NEDA rates did not differ meaningfully by age or by baseline CEL status. Patients with only one prior DMT had higher NEDA rates than those with two prior DMTs, and NEDA was highest when interferon‑based regimens were the last prior treatment and lowest when fingolimod was the last prior DMT. Only sex (female vs male) emerged as a significant prognostic factor in multivariable analysis, with women somewhat less likely to achieve NEDA.\n\nClinical outcomes were consistent with the primary endpoint. At Week 96, Kaplan–Meier estimated event‑free rates were 76.3% for any disease‑activity event, 88.4% for 24‑week CDP, and 90.0% for first relapse. Among patients with baseline EDSS ≥2, 16.5% experienced 24‑week CDI. Mean EDSS remained essentially stable from baseline to Week 96, and 86.6% of evaluable patients had stable or improved EDSS (change between −0.5 and +0.5 or improvement). The adjusted ARR at Week 96 was 0.030, corresponding to approximately one relapse every 33 years on average.\n\nMRI data showed near‑complete suppression of inflammatory lesion activity from Week 8 onward. Very few CELs and new/enlarging T2 lesions were detected at Weeks 24, 48, and 96, and adjusted lesion rates were very low and decreased over time. Total T2 lesion volume decreased by about 8.5% on average from Week 8 to Week 96. Normalized whole‑brain volume, white matter volume, and cortical gray matter volume decreased modestly over the treatment period, with rates of brain volume loss in the range typical of healthy aging.\n\nSafety analyses showed that ocrelizumab was generally well tolerated and no new safety signals were identified compared with previous trials. Overall, 89.1% of patients experienced at least one adverse event (AE); most were mild to moderate (Grade 1–2). Infusion‑related reactions (IRRs), nasopharyngitis, headache, influenza, and urinary tract infection were the most frequent AEs. IRRs occurred in 43.2% of patients, were mostly Grade 1–2, and were most common with the first infusion. Serious AEs occurred in 7.2% of patients, with serious infections in 1.6%. Neoplasms were rare, with a small number of basal cell carcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, and benign thymic neoplasm cases. AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were infrequent (1.0%). One death (suicide) occurred. No notable safety issues were observed in laboratory parameters, physical or neurological examinations, vital signs, or non‑MS MRI findings.\n\nIn summary, CASTING demonstrates that in RRMS patients with suboptimal responses to one or two prior DMTs, switching to ocrelizumab results in high rates of no evidence of disease activity over 2 years, stable or improved disability, strong suppression of MRI disease activity, and acceptable safety. The results support early switching to a high‑efficacy B‑cell‑depleting therapy such as ocrelizumab in patients with breakthrough disease activity on other DMTs, and suggest that earlier use (first switch) and less advanced disease are associated with better NEDA outcomes.""}","{""conditions"": [""Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis"", ""Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting"", ""Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis""], ""keywords"": [""Ocrelizumab"", ""CD20-Positive B-Cell Depletion"", ""Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis"", ""Multiple Sclerosis"", ""Disease-Modifying Therapies"", ""Interferon-beta"", ""Glatiramer Acetate"", ""Fingolimod"", ""Dimethyl Fumarate"", ""Teriflunomide"", ""Natalizumab"", ""No Evidence of Disease Activity"", ""NEDA"", ""Magnetic Resonance Imaging"", ""MRI Re-baselining"", ""T2 Hyperintense Lesions"", ""Gadolinium-Enhancing Lesions"", ""Contrast-Enhancing Lesions"", ""Expanded Disability Status Scale"", ""EDSS"", ""Relapse Rate"", ""Annualized Relapse Rate"", ""Brain Volume Loss"", ""White Matter Volume"", ""Cortical Gray Matter Volume"", ""Suboptimal Response to Prior Therapy"", ""Treatment Switch"", ""Phase 3b Trial"", ""Open-Label Study""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE3""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""NA"", ""interventionModel"": ""SINGLE_GROUP"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Prospective, international, multicenter, single-arm, open-label phase 3b trial in which all eligible RRMS patients received intravenous ocrelizumab 600 mg every 24 weeks for 96 weeks."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": ""COHORT"", ""timePerspective"": ""PROSPECTIVE"", ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Open-label study with no blinding; all participants and investigators were aware of ocrelizumab treatment."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 680, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Ocrelizumab 600 mg IV every 24 weeks"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Single-arm, open-label treatment: patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and suboptimal response to one or two prior disease-modifying therapies received intravenous ocrelizumab 600 mg every 24 weeks for a total treatment period of 96 weeks (last dose at Week 72).

Adults aged 55 and older with heart failure received Bluetooth-enabled weight scales and activity trackers for 12 weeks and were randomized to either use these sensors alone (control) or sensors plus the SCDG app (intervention). The game used real-time sensor data to trigger in‑game rewards, feedback, and tailored messages to motivate daily weight monitoring and physical activity. The study evaluated feasibility (recruitment, retention, engagement, satisfaction) and preliminary effects on adherence to daily weighing and physical activity, as well as heart failure knowledge, functional status, quality of life, self-care behaviors, self-efficacy, motivation, and heart failure–related hospitalizations over 24 weeks."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This prospective feasibility randomized controlled trial (1:1 allocation) evaluated an innovative sensor-controlled digital game (SCDG) intervention, Heart Health Mountain, designed to improve heart failure (HF) self-management behaviors among older adults. The trial compared two parallel groups: (1) a sensors-only control group that received an activity tracker, a Bluetooth-enabled smart weighing scale, and the Withings Health Mate app to track daily weight and physical activity; and (2) an intervention group that received the same sensors plus access to the Heart Health Mountain SCDG app.\n\nEligible participants were English-speaking adults aged 55 years or older with a diagnosis of HF (New York Heart Association class II or III), who owned a smartphone, could ambulate independently, and had adequate cognition (Mini-Cog score ≥4). Exclusion criteria included severe visual or tactile impairment precluding smartphone use, end-stage renal failure, terminal illness, or lack of confirmed HF diagnosis. Participants were recruited from cardiac rehabilitation and inpatient cardiac units in Texas and, later, also via web-based recruitment in Texas and Oklahoma. The study period spanned November 2019 to January 2021, with adaptation to remote procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Heart Health Mountain SCDG, delivered on a smartphone, is grounded in the Fogg behavioral model, targeting motivation, ability, and triggers for behavior change. In the game, the player helps an avatar climb a mountain while aiming to avoid hospitalization. Real-time data from the Bluetooth scale and activity tracker are synchronized with the game so that actual daily behaviors—weight monitoring and step-based physical activity—drive game progress, rewards (eg, coins to purchase low-salt foods or avatar accessories), competition elements (eg, leaderboards), and tailored feedback (eg, advice in response to weight gain). Step goals are individualized, ranging from 3000 to 15,000 steps per day. Heart failure educational content derived from the \""Living Well With Heart Failure\"" booklet is embedded in the game in small, low-literacy segments, with quizzes and problem-solving scenarios to reinforce knowledge and skills.\n\nBoth groups received standardized HF education; in the intervention group it was integrated into the game, while the control group received equivalent written materials. Sensor and game data were transmitted via the Health Mate app and the SCDG platform to a secure Google Cloud console. During the first week, a nursing research assistant remotely monitored data flow for troubleshooting. Training and installation were initially conducted in person and then transitioned to contactless device delivery and remote (phone/video) support during the pandemic.\n\nFeasibility outcomes included:\n- Recruitment: proportion of approached HF patients who enrolled.\n- Retention: proportion completing 12-week objective behavior tracking and 24-week follow-up surveys.\n- Engagement: proportion of intervention participants who used the SCDG on at least 50% of days over 12 weeks, and number of days with game use.\n- Satisfaction: ratings using the interest/enjoyment subscale of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory and qualitative feedback about likes, dislikes, and perceived motivational elements.\n\nHealth and behavior outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 weeks. Objective primary behavior outcomes were:\n- Daily weight monitoring: number of days with recorded weight from the Bluetooth scale (dichotomous per day: yes/no).\n- Physical activity: daily step counts from the activity tracker, averaged over 6 and 12 weeks.\n\nAdditional self-reported measures included:\n- HF-related functional status and quality of life using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) functional status (items 1–12) and quality-of-life (items 13–15) domains (0–100 scales, higher scores better).\n- HF knowledge using the 30-item Atlanta Heart Failure Knowledge Test.\n- HF self-care behaviors using the 9-item European Heart Failure Self-care Behavior Scale (standardized 0–100 score, higher better).\n- HF self-efficacy using the 6-item self-efficacy section of the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (0–100 scale).\n- Motivation for HF self-management behaviors using an HF-adapted 19-item Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire, computing a Relative Autonomy Index from autonomous and controlled regulation subscales.\n- HF-related hospitalizations via self-report with verification by discharge summaries or provider communication.\n- Depressive symptoms using the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire at all time points.\n\nRandomization used block sizes of 2 and 4, stratified by sex, with concealed allocation generated independently. The intervention and assessment staff were separated, and analysts were blinded to group assignment. Analyses were primarily descriptive, appropriate for feasibility work. Within-group changes were assessed with paired t tests, and effect sizes (Cohen d) were estimated for primary outcomes. Missing data were handled according to intent-to-treat principles using maximum likelihood estimation.\n\nThirty-eight participants were enrolled (19 per group). About half were women, half were ≥65 years, most were White, and over half had been hospitalized for HF in the prior 6 months. Retention was high: 32 of 38 participants provided 12-week objective behavior data, and 27 of 38 completed 24-week follow-up surveys. Among the intervention group, 15 of 19 successfully installed the SCDG app; of these, 11 used the game on more than 50% of days over 12 weeks. Game use days correlated strongly with days of weight monitoring (r≈0.72) and days with activity data (r≈0.90), suggesting that engagement with the SCDG was closely linked to engagement in HF self-management behaviors.\n\nTrends favored the SCDG group for behavior adherence. Compared with baseline self-report, a larger proportion of intervention participants achieved the clinically meaningful goal of weighing at least 5 days per week at 12 weeks, whereas the control group showed a slight decline. The effect size for mean days of weight monitoring at 12 weeks (intervention vs control) was in the medium range. Physical activity steps showed modest increases in the intervention group and modest declines in the control group from week 6 to week 12, though absolute step counts remained below general cardiovascular recommendations, which may reflect age, HF severity, and comorbid frailty.\n\nEngagement in dual behaviors (days with both a weight measurement and activity data) was more tightly coupled in the intervention group than in the control group, suggesting that the game may help integrate multiple HF self-care behaviors into daily routines. Subgroup trends indicated that women tended to weigh less frequently than men overall, but both sexes demonstrated better adherence in the intervention group than in the control group.\n\nBoth groups exhibited within-group improvements in HF functional status and quality of life (KCCQ scores) that were clinically and statistically significant and persisted through 24 weeks. HF knowledge improved modestly but significantly in both groups and was maintained at follow-up. Self-efficacy for HF self-care improved in both arms, with slightly greater trends in the control group, possibly related to continued sensor use. Self-reported HF self-care behaviors improved more consistently and durably in the intervention group than in the control group. Motivation (autonomous regulation) showed minimal change, possibly because participation itself implied an element of external accountability.\n\nHF hospitalization rates declined in both groups at 1 and 6 months; however, interpretations are limited by concurrent global reductions in cardiovascular hospitalizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Technical limitations included outdated activity trackers and sync issues for some participants, as well as challenges in real-time monitoring of unsafe weight changes due to high message volume with the alert system.\n\nOverall, this feasibility trial showed that an SCDG integrating real-time sensor data is acceptable and usable for older adults with HF and can be implemented both in person and remotely. Recruitment, retention, and engagement benchmarks were met or exceeded, and participant feedback highlighted the game’s motivational and educational value, while also identifying desires for more sophisticated game features and individualized step goals. The findings support conducting a larger, fully powered efficacy trial to rigorously test the impact of sensor-controlled digital gaming on HF self-management behaviors, functional outcomes, quality of life, and HF-related health care utilization.""}","{""conditions"": [""Heart Failure"", ""Congestive Heart Failure""], ""keywords"": [""Heart Failure"", ""Self-Management"", ""Self-Care"", ""Telemedicine"", ""Mobile Health"", ""mHealth"", ""Video Games"", ""Serious Games"", ""Gamification"", ""Wearable Electronic Devices"", ""Activity Tracker"", ""Digital Health"", ""Physical Activity"", ""Exercise"", ""Body Weight"", ""Weight Monitoring"", ""Quality of Life"", ""Self Efficacy"", ""Patient Education as Topic"", ""Hospitalization""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Prospective feasibility randomized controlled trial with 1:1 allocation to two parallel groups: sensors-only control versus sensors plus sensor-controlled digital game app, conducted over a 12-week intervention and 24-week follow-up."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""DEVICE_FEASIBILITY"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""SINGLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Outcome assessment and data analysis were blinded: the research assistant collecting baseline and follow-up surveys was different from the assistant delivering the intervention, and the data analyst was blinded to group assignment.

One trial enrolled HIV‑positive pregnant women and the other enrolled HIV‑negative pregnant women. In both trials, all women received assisted partner notification services. Women in the intervention groups additionally received targeted education on oral HIV self‑testing and up to five HIV self‑test kits to give to their partners. The primary outcome was whether the woman’s primary male partner tested for HIV at a health facility within 30 days. A secondary prespecified outcome was male partner HIV testing of any kind (including self‑testing at home) within 30 days. The hypothesis was that combining partner notification with secondary distribution of HIV self‑test kits would increase male partner HIV testing, particularly facility‑based testing that could facilitate linkage to HIV prevention and treatment services."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This research comprised two parallel, individual‑level, unmasked randomized controlled trials conducted at Chipata Level 1 Hospital, a public facility in Lusaka, Zambia, where antenatal HIV prevalence is approximately 16%. The trials evaluated a combination approach to increase HIV testing among male partners of pregnant women, comparing partner notification services alone versus partner notification plus secondary distribution of HIV self‑test kits.\n\nTrial 1 enrolled pregnant women aged 18 years or older with documented HIV‑positive test results in their antenatal record. Trial 2 enrolled pregnant women aged 18 years or older with documented HIV‑negative test results obtained within the previous 3 months of the current pregnancy. Eligible women had at least one current male sexual partner, were willing and able to consent, provide contact information, and adhere to study procedures. Women who had already undergone couples HIV testing with their partner during the current pregnancy or who reported concerns about intimate partner violence (IPV) or social harms at screening were excluded. HIV‑positive and HIV‑negative women were enrolled into separate trials.\n\nParticipants in both trials were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to a control group or an intervention group using permuted block randomization with varying block sizes (2, 4, and 6). Allocation was implemented via sealed, opaque, sequentially numbered envelopes. The study was unmasked: participants and staff knew the group assignments.\n\nIn both trials, all participants received assisted partner notification services, consistent with WHO recommendations and Zambian guidelines. Women were offered four options for encouraging male partner HIV testing: (1) client self‑referral (the woman discloses her status and encourages the partner to seek testing), (2) provider contract referral (the woman agrees to notify the partner within a set period, after which providers may contact the partner if testing has not occurred), (3) provider referral (with the woman’s consent, a provider directly contacts the partner to offer testing), and (4) dual referral (a provider accompanies the woman for joint disclosure and offers testing). HIV‑negative women received an adapted, status‑neutral version of these services focused on HIV prevention rather than treatment. Nearly all women selected client self‑referral.\n\nIn the intervention arms of both trials, women additionally received targeted education on the use of oral fluid HIV self‑test kits (OraQuick) for their partners (and themselves if desired). Written multilingual instructions (English, Bemba, Nyanja) were provided, using materials approved by the Zambia Ministry of Health. Up to five oral HIV self‑test kits were supplied per participant for secondary distribution to male partners. All participants, irrespective of group, were advised that HIV testing at a health facility by trained health‑care providers was recommended, including confirmatory facility‑based testing following any self‑test result.\n\nWomen were scheduled for a follow‑up visit approximately 30 days after enrolment. At this visit, they reported whether their primary male partner had undergone HIV testing in the previous 30 days, including date, test modality, and venue (facility‑based or elsewhere, e.g., home self‑testing). The primary outcome was the proportion of primary male partners reported to have been tested for HIV at a health facility within 30 days after randomization. A prespecified additional outcome (added before study completion) was the proportion of primary male partners reported to have undergone HIV testing of any kind within 30 days, including self‑testing at home or testing at community‑based venues. Partner HIV test results (positive, negative, indeterminate), reported linkage to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and any serious adverse events were also recorded.\n\nSafety assessments included screening for intimate partner violence and social harms potentially related to study participation. A nine‑item IPV questionnaire adapted from the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey and social harm questions adapted from prior Malawian studies were administered at follow‑up. Any affirmative response was considered an incident IPV or social harm event. Participants reporting IPV or social harms were counselled and referred to a gender‑based violence command center on‑site when appropriate.\n\nStatistical analyses used a complete‑case approach with the woman as the unit of analysis, conducted separately for the two trials. The primary analysis compared the proportion of women reporting facility‑based partner HIV testing within 30 days between intervention and control groups using an estimated probability difference (risk difference) with Wald‑based 95% confidence intervals. The same method was used for the outcome of partner HIV testing of any kind. Prespecified sensitivity analyses employed an augmented inverse probability weighted doubly robust approach adjusting for partner age, age difference, travel time to facility, and partner HIV testing history, with bootstrapped confidence intervals. Additional sensitivity analyses included best‑case/worst‑case bounds for missing data and multiple imputation using fully conditional specification. A pooled analysis weighted by site antenatal HIV prevalence (16%) was done to provide population‑level estimates, and time‑to‑event analyses using Kaplan–Meier curves described days from randomization to reported partner HIV testing, with right‑censoring at 30 days.\n\nRecruitment took place from Oct 28, 2019, to May 26, 2020. Of 426 pregnant women approached, 97 (23%) who had already tested with their partner during the current pregnancy were excluded. Of 329 screened for full eligibility, three HIV‑negative women under age 18 were excluded. Ultimately, 116 HIV‑positive women were enrolled in trial 1 (58 intervention, 58 control) and 210 HIV‑negative women in trial 2 (105 intervention, 105 control). Retention at 30 days was 86% (100/116) in trial 1 and 95% (200/210) in trial 2.\n\nIn both trials, the intervention significantly reduced reported facility‑based male partner HIV testing within 30 days but increased overall male partner HIV testing of any kind, driven by self‑testing. Among HIV‑positive women (trial 1), 6% (3/47) of partners in the intervention group versus 28% (15/53) in the control group underwent facility‑based testing (probability difference −21.9 percentage points, 95% CI −35.9 to −7.9). Among HIV‑negative women (trial 2), 3% (3/102) of partners in the intervention group versus 34% (33/98) in the control group had facility‑based testing (probability difference −30.7 percentage points, 95% CI −40.6 to −20.8). In pooled standardized analyses, the estimated probability difference for facility‑based testing was −29.3 percentage points (95% CI −37.9 to −20.7).\n\nConversely, when HIV testing of any kind was considered, the intervention improved overall partner testing rates. In trial 1, 77% (36/47) of women in the intervention group versus 36% (19/53) in the control group reported any partner HIV testing (probability difference 40.7 percentage points, 95% CI 23.0 to 58.4). In trial 2, the corresponding figures were 78% (80/102) versus 55% (54/98), respectively (probability difference 23.3 percentage points, 95% CI 10.7 to 36.0). In pooled standardized analysis, the probability difference for any testing was 26.1 percentage points (95% CI 15.1 to 37.1).\n\nAcross both trials, 14 male partners were reported to have tested HIV‑positive. In trial 1, 13 of 55 tested partners of HIV‑positive women were HIV‑positive and eight were reported to be on ART. Many partners of HIV‑positive women were reported to be HIV‑negative, indicating a high prevalence of HIV‑serodiscordant couples. In trial 2 (HIV‑negative women), most tested partners were reported HIV‑negative; one partner had an indeterminate result and one tested HIV‑positive and initiated ART.\n\nAdverse social outcomes were uncommon. Three cases of intimate partner violence were reported in total: two in control groups and one in an intervention group. One control‑group HIV‑positive woman reported IPV, abandonment, and emotional and legal harms linked to study participation. Two additional IPV events (one intervention, one control) were reported but not attributed to study procedures. No IPV or social harms were reported among HIV‑negative women. One maternal death occurred in an HIV‑positive woman in the intervention group due to meningoencephalitis from advanced HIV disease, considered unrelated to the study.\n\nThe study demonstrates that combining assisted partner notification with secondary distribution of HIV self‑test kits substantially increases overall male partner HIV testing among both HIV‑positive and HIV‑negative pregnant women but simultaneously reduces the proportion of men who present for facility‑based testing, potentially limiting opportunities for counselling, confirmatory diagnosis, HIV treatment initiation, and HIV prevention interventions such as pre‑exposure prophylaxis. The findings highlight a need to strengthen linkages between community‑based and self‑testing approaches and formal health services so that men who test (particularly those living with HIV or at high risk) are effectively connected to comprehensive HIV care and prevention. The trials also underscore the feasibility of a status‑neutral, couples‑based framework for engaging male partners in antenatal HIV services while maintaining a low observed incidence of IPV and social harms among screened participants.""}","{""conditions"": [""HIV Infections"", ""Pregnancy"", ""Prenatal Care"", ""Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV"", ""Sexual Partners"", ""Intimate Partner Violence""], ""keywords"": [""HIV"", ""HIV Infections"", ""HIV Self-Testing"", ""OraQuick"", ""Partner Notification and Contact Tracing"", ""Male Partner HIV Testing"", ""Pregnancy"", ""Antenatal Care"", ""Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV"", ""PMTCT"", ""HIV Serodiscordant Couples"", ""Antiretroviral Therapy"", ""HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis"", ""Zambia"", ""Lusaka"", ""Randomized Controlled Trial"", ""Self-Testing"", ""Couples HIV Counseling and Testing"", ""Intimate Partner Violence"", ""Social Harms""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Two parallel, individual-level, randomized controlled trials conducted in the same setting.

The primary outcome was complete resolution of fever and respiratory symptoms at day 7. Among 203 participants (median age 35 years, mostly without comorbidities), ciclesonide did not significantly increase the proportion with symptom resolution at day 7 or day 14 compared with placebo, and hospitalizations were infrequent in both groups. The study concluded that in this relatively young, healthy outpatient population with prominent respiratory symptoms, inhaled and intranasal ciclesonide did not provide a clear clinical benefit, and further placebo-controlled research in higher-risk populations is needed."", ""detailedDescription"": ""The CONTAIN trial was a multicentre, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study conducted in three Canadian provinces (Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia) to assess whether early administration of inhaled and intranasal ciclesonide improves respiratory symptom resolution in adult outpatients with COVID-19.\n\nAdults aged 18 years or older with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and at least one mandatory symptom (fever, cough—wet or dry—or dyspnoea, including shortness of breath, chest congestion, or chest tightness) were eligible, provided they were not hospitalized and were not already receiving inhaled corticosteroids. Recruitment was done via testing site lists, telehealth clinics, and social media, and enrollment occurred online with electronic informed consent. The trial aimed to recruit participants early in the disease course, initially within five days of symptom onset and later allowing up to six days if same-day delivery of study drug was possible. Vaccinated individuals were excluded once COVID-19 vaccination became widespread, to maintain a relatively homogeneous, unvaccinated outpatient cohort.\n\nParticipants were randomized 1:1 using a centrally generated, sex-stratified permuted block schedule to receive either active ciclesonide or placebo. The intervention consisted of high-dose inhaled ciclesonide 600 μg twice daily (total 1200 μg/day) plus intranasal ciclesonide 200 μg once daily, administered for 14 days. The control group received a saline metered dose inhaler and intranasal saline matched in appearance and dosing schedule. Study medication was shipped to participants, usually overnight, with same-day delivery for those enrolled on day 6 of symptoms. Investigators, participants, and statisticians remained blinded to allocation throughout the trial.\n\nOutcome data were self-reported using structured electronic surveys completed on the day of enrolment, treatment day 0, and days 1, 3, 7, 10, and 14, with an additional day-29 follow-up for longer-term outcomes (reported elsewhere). The prespecified primary endpoint was complete resolution of self-reported fever and all respiratory symptoms (cough and dyspnoea or equivalents) at day 7 after initiation of therapy. Respiratory symptoms were defined as any cough (wet or dry) or dyspnoea (shortness of breath, chest tightness, or chest congestion). Key secondary outcomes included hospital admission or death due to COVID-19, resolution of the primary symptom set by day 14, global improvement in overall feeling by days 7 and 14, resolution of dyspnoea among those with baseline dyspnoea, improvement in cough severity on a 0–10 visual analogue scale, and changes in patient-reported outcomes for dyspnoea, sleep disturbance, and anxiety using PROMIS instruments. Adverse events, including thrush, throat irritation, voice change, wheeze, nausea, and headache, were monitored via questionnaires and direct participant contact.\n\nThe modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population included participants who received at least one dose of study drug and completed at least one follow-up survey. Of 215 randomized individuals, 203 were included in the mITT analysis: 105 in the ciclesonide group and 98 in the placebo group. The median age was 35 years (interquartile range 27–47) and 54% were women. Chronic health conditions were reported by about one-fifth of participants, and only 7% were current smokers. At baseline, 86% reported cough, 50% reported dyspnoea or equivalent symptoms, and 46% reported fever, reflecting a cohort with prominent respiratory involvement.\n\nBy day 7, fever and all respiratory symptoms had resolved in 37% of participants overall. The primary outcome occurred in 40% (42/105) of the ciclesonide group and 35% (34/98) of the placebo group. Using binomial regression adjusted for sex, the absolute risk difference was 5.5% (95% confidence interval −7.8% to 18.8%), which was not statistically significant. The per-protocol analysis, excluding non-adherent participants, yielded a similar adjusted risk difference of 3.4% (95% CI −10.4% to 17.1%). At day 14, 66% (69/105) of the ciclesonide group and 58% (57/98) of the placebo group achieved resolution of fever and respiratory symptoms, with an adjusted risk difference of 7.5% (95% CI −5.9% to 20.8%), again without clear evidence of benefit.\n\nHospitalization was infrequent: six participants in the ciclesonide arm and three in the placebo arm required hospital admission; no deaths occurred. PROMIS-based measures of dyspnoea, sleep disturbance, and anxiety did not show meaningful between-group differences. Overall adherence to study medication was high in both groups (approximately 93–94% took the drug on most survey days or until symptom resolution). Side effects were somewhat more common in the ciclesonide group (22% vs 15%), with headache and nausea being the most frequently reported; however, no major safety concerns emerged, and blinding appeared to be well maintained.\n\nThe original sample size calculation, based on a prior outpatient COVID-19 hydroxychloroquine trial, assumed that 65% of participants would have symptom resolution by day 7 and that ciclesonide would increase this proportion to 80%, requiring 318 participants to provide 80% power with a two-sided α of 0.05, accounting for up to 15% dropout. The CONTAIN trial was halted early, after recruitment slowed markedly due to rising vaccination rates and declining COVID-19 incidence, and after emerging data and practical constraints suggested that the planned sample size and effect size would not be achievable. An interim data safety monitoring board review did not identify safety issues but confirmed lower-than-expected day-7 symptom resolution rates (~37%), likely reflecting the enrichment of participants with respiratory symptoms.\n\nThe investigators concluded that, in this predominantly young, otherwise healthy outpatient cohort with early, symptomatic COVID-19 and prominent respiratory complaints, high-dose inhaled plus intranasal ciclesonide did not confer a statistically significant advantage over placebo in achieving complete symptom resolution by day 7 or day 14. The trial may have been underpowered to detect small effect sizes, and the findings may not generalize to older or higher-risk populations. Given in vitro evidence of antiviral activity for ciclesonide and suggestive but methodologically limited findings from open-label inhaled corticosteroid trials (e.g., with budesonide), the authors recommend further adequately powered, placebo-controlled trials, particularly focusing on higher-risk patients and longer follow-up periods, to clarify whether inhaled corticosteroids meaningfully impact symptom burden or clinical deterioration in COVID-19.""}","{""conditions"": [""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2 Infection"", ""Cough"", ""Dyspnea"", ""Fever""], ""keywords"": [""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""Coronavirus Infections"", ""Ciclesonide"", ""Inhaled Corticosteroids"", ""Intranasal Corticosteroids"", ""Outpatients"", ""Respiratory Symptoms"", ""Cough"", ""Dyspnea"", ""Shortness of Breath"", ""Fever"", ""Randomized Controlled Trial"", ""Placebo-Controlled"", ""Nonhospitalized Adults""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Two-arm, 1:1 parallel-group trial comparing inhaled plus intranasal ciclesonide versus matched inhaled and intranasal saline placebo in nonhospitalized adults with symptomatic COVID-19."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""TRIPLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial in which participants, investigators, and statisticians were blinded to treatment allocation;

Both devices were safe and effective for tissue division and vessel sealing, with similar intraoperative and postoperative complication rates. THUNDERBEAT showed modest advantages in certain aspects of omental dissection, tissue manipulation, and surgeon-reported handling, but these differences were not deemed clinically meaningful."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This study was a prospective, randomized, pilot trial conducted at a single academic institution to compare the performance of two compressive energy devices—THUNDERBEAT (Olympus, Japan) and Maryland LigaSure (Medtronic, USA)—in laparoscopic left colectomy. Adult patients (age ≥18 years, ASA I–III) scheduled for elective laparoscopic left colectomy for neoplasm or diverticulitis were enrolled after informed consent. Key exclusion criteria included morbid obesity (BMI >35), multiple prior abdominal operations, preoperative anticoagulation, coagulopathy, pregnancy, and any contraindication to electrosurgery.\n\nPatients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio using permuted blocks to Group 1 (THUNDERBEAT) or Group 2 (LigaSure). All procedures used standardized laparoscopic equipment and preset generator settings. Surgeons were experienced colorectal laparoscopists and had used each device on at least 10 patients prior to the trial.\n\nTwo primary outcomes were defined. The first was dissection time to specimen removal (DTSR), measured in minutes from the start of colon mobilization to removal of the specimen from the abdominal cavity. The second was a versatility score, a composite metric (range 1–5 per segment, 1 worst to 5 best) incorporating five weighted domains: hemostasis (0.275), sealing (0.275), cutting (0.2), dissection (0.15), and tissue manipulation (0.1). Versatility was evaluated for six predefined surgical segments of left colectomy, including inferior mesenteric artery/vein pedicle division, retroperitoneal dissection, omental dissection/resection, splenic flexure takedown, lateral colonic dissection, and mesenteric/pelvic dissection. Segment-wise scores were averaged to obtain an overall versatility score. A mean score ≥3.5 was considered high versatility.\n\nSecondary measures included a global \""drier surgical field\"" score (1–5) assessing overall oozing and bleeding, detailed vessel sealing performance (number of activations and success of sealing for left colic, sigmoid, superior rectal arteries, and IMA/IMV), estimated blood loss, the need for instrument exchanges, and intraoperative complications including device-related bleeding or thermal injury. Postoperative outcomes comprised gastrointestinal recovery (time to first flatus, bowel movement, and solid food), 30-day complications graded by Clavien–Dindo (including anastomotic leak, rectal bleeding, ileus, wound hematoma, urinary tract infection), reoperation, readmission, length of stay, and mortality. Coagulation parameters (PT, PTT, INR) were checked preoperatively. Follow-up was 30 days for all patients.\n\nSurgeon-reported device usability was assessed immediately postoperatively using an 8-item survey (1–10 scale) covering handle operation, maneuverability, weight balance, fatigue/pain from handle use, ease of activating seal/cut buttons, ease of turning the rotation knob, confidence in sealing large vessels (>5 mm), and overall satisfaction.\n\nA total of 73 patients were enrolled between February 2016 and April 2019; 13 were withdrawn before randomization for reasons such as surgery cancellation or change in surgical plan. Sixty patients were randomized and analyzed (31 THUNDERBEAT, 29 LigaSure). Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics (age, sex, BMI, ASA class, diagnosis, comorbidities) were similar between groups. All procedures were initiated laparoscopically; a small number were converted to open surgery in each group without significant between-group difference.\n\nThere was no statistically significant difference in the primary time outcome. Median DTSR was 91 minutes (range 41–172) for THUNDERBEAT vs 77 minutes (38–175) for LigaSure (p=0.214). Total operative time was also similar: 176 vs 170 minutes (p=0.311). The authors note that a post hoc power analysis suggested the study was underpowered to detect relatively small time differences.\n\nRegarding versatility, both devices achieved high overall scores. THUNDERBEAT had a slightly higher overall versatility mean score (4.8±0.18 vs 4.7±0.22, p=0.045). THUNDERBEAT also showed significantly better scores in segment 3 (omental dissection/resection) overall versatility (4.9±0.25 vs 4.7±0.39, p=0.041), as well as in specific subcomponents of segment 3: dissection (p=0.011) and tissue manipulation (p=0.026). In segment 6 (mesenteric/pelvic dissection), THUNDERBEAT had a higher sealing score (p=0.023). These differences were numerically small and judged by the authors as not clinically consequential given that both devices scored in the high versatility range.\n\nThe dryness of the surgical field, estimated blood loss, need for intraoperative transfusion, and rates of bleeding during sealing or mesenteric dissection were similar between groups. Vessel sealing of major mesenteric vessels (IMA/IMV and branches) was successful in over 93% of cases in both groups, with comparable numbers of applications needed. In rare instances of heavily calcified vessels, additional clips were required in both arms.\n\nNo intraoperative or postoperative complications were directly attributed to device failure or thermal injury. Concerns about higher jaw temperatures and thermal spread with ultrasonic energy were not borne out clinically in this series. Postoperative outcomes—including return of bowel function, length of hospital and postsurgical stay, 30-day complication rates (including anastomotic leaks and postoperative rectal bleeding), reoperations, and readmissions—did not differ significantly between THUNDERBEAT and LigaSure. No deaths occurred.\n\nSurgeon surveys indicated a preference for THUNDERBEAT in several handling aspects: ease of opening/closing the handle (p=0.012), maneuverability (p<0.0001), and ease of pressing seal/cut buttons (p=0.007), as well as higher overall satisfaction (p=0.015). LigaSure showed a nonsignificant trend toward less hand fatigue and pain. The authors caution that these usability findings may be influenced by surgeon familiarity and preference, as only five surgeons participated and one highly experienced surgeon operated on about half the patients.\n\nThe study concludes that both THUNDERBEAT and Maryland LigaSure are safe and effective energy devices for soft tissue division and mesenteric vessel sealing in laparoscopic left colectomy. No meaningful difference was found in operative time or complication rates. THUNDERBEAT demonstrated some advantages in omental dissection, tissue manipulation, and certain aspects of usability, but these did not translate into clear clinical superiority.

The main hypothesis is that proactive linkage to the bridge clinic will reduce hospital length of stay and readmissions, improve linkage to ongoing MOUD care, reduce relapse and overdose, enhance quality of life, and lower overall costs of care compared with usual care."", ""detailedDescription"": ""The Bridging Recovery Initiative Despite Gaps in Entry (BRIDGE) trial is a pragmatic, single-center, superiority, randomized controlled trial conducted at Vanderbilt University Hospital, an ~800-bed tertiary care adult hospital in Nashville, Tennessee. The study is embedded in routine clinical care and evaluates the effectiveness of a newly implemented, multidisciplinary, hospital-based \""bridge\"" clinic designed to provide transitional addiction care for patients with opioid use disorder (OUD).\n\nBackground and Rationale:\nPatients with substance use disorders, particularly OUD, are overrepresented among general hospital inpatients and often experience longer lengths of stay and higher readmission rates. Despite evidence that medications for OUD (MOUD), such as buprenorphine-naloxone and naltrexone, improve treatment retention, reduce illicit use, and decrease overdose deaths, access to MOUD after hospital discharge is limited. Transitional \""bridge\"" clinics have emerged to address care fragmentation by rapidly linking hospitalized patients to low-threshold, multidisciplinary addiction care within the same health system. However, the effectiveness of this model has not been rigorously evaluated.\n\nStudy Objectives and Hypothesis:\nThe primary objective is to determine whether offering referral to the bridge clinic reduces index hospital length of stay (LOS) for patients hospitalized with OUD who initiate MOUD during their admission. Secondary objectives include assessing whether the intervention improves linkage to MOUD care, MOUD prescription fill rates, recurrence of opioid use, emergency department (ED) visits, readmission rates, hospital- and ED-free days, quality of life, overdose, mortality, and total cost of care. Additional objectives among patients with injection-related infections include evaluating infection outcomes and the feasibility of outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT). The central hypothesis is that proactive linkage via the bridge clinic will reduce LOS and healthcare utilization while improving clinical and patient-centered outcomes compared with usual discharge planning.\n\nDesign and Population:\nThe trial began on 25 November 2019 and is planned to run for approximately 18 months. It enrolls adults (≥18 years) hospitalized with active OUD who are being considered for MOUD by the addiction consult service and who accept a transitional prescription for buprenorphine-naloxone or intramuscular naltrexone. Eligible patients must not already have a fixed outpatient MOUD plan (e.g., a pre-existing MOUD provider relationship they intend to continue) and must reside in Middle Tennessee counties to ensure feasible follow-up. Exclusions include severe active psychiatric disorders requiring a higher level of psychiatric care, patients for whom methadone maintenance is deemed the most appropriate MOUD, prior randomization in the trial, or prior referral to the bridge clinic before trial initiation.\n\nRandomization and Arms:\nPatients are identified via electronic consult orders or referrals to the addiction consult service. After clinical evaluation and confirmation of eligibility, the addiction consult service social worker randomizes patients through REDCap using a pre-specified sequence with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Randomization is capacity-constrained: the bridge clinic has fixed weekly intake capacity, and randomization is used to allocate limited clinic slots fairly and to create a comparison group among those who could otherwise be referred.\n\nIntervention arm (Bridge clinic referral):\nPatients randomized to the intervention are offered referral to a co-located, multidisciplinary bridge clinic operating all day on Fridays. The clinic provides wraparound services regardless of insurance status, with grant-funded medications and institutional write-off of visit and laboratory charges for uninsured patients. The clinical team includes addiction psychiatry, internal medicine, infectious diseases, pain-anesthesia physicians, a psychiatric nurse practitioner, social workers, a nurse case manager, and recovery coaches. Patients are initially asked to attend weekly visits for the first 8 weeks (if maintaining abstinence), then twice monthly, with an intended stabilization and transition period of up to 3 months (flexible up to about a year). Each visit typically includes at least one medical provider and one non-medical provider (for psychotherapy, peer support, or case management), urine toxicology testing, and close coordination of care, including prescription refills for controlled medications (e.g., buprenorphine) in short (e.g., 7-day) supplies during early treatment.\n\nThe bridge clinic supports transitions from inpatient care, the emergency department, and other institutional settings, and facilitates referral to longer-term addiction treatment (e.g., primary care-based MOUD, intensive outpatient, residential programs) and management of co-occurring conditions. Team huddles are used to coordinate care and identify patients needing a higher level of care. For certain patients with injection-related infections, the trial incorporates a structured assessment of candidacy for outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT), including evaluation of housing stability, caregiver support, and feasibility of home-based intravenous antibiotic administration.\n\nControl arm (Usual care):\nPatients randomized to usual care receive standard discharge planning by the primary medical team’s social worker. The addiction consult service continues usual inpatient care, including MOUD initiation and management of comorbidities. The primary team’s social worker then arranges outpatient MOUD and recovery resources tailored to the patient's insurance coverage, transportation options, and preferences. The bridge clinic is not available outside the trial for otherwise study-eligible patients during the study period.\n\nOutcomes and Data Collection:\nData are drawn from the electronic health record (EHR) and ancillary systems as part of usual care and managed in REDCap. Demographic and clinical data, as well as hospital utilization metrics, are routinely captured.\n\nPrimary outcome:\n- Index hospital length of stay (LOS).\n\nSecondary outcomes (over 16-week follow-up):\n- Linkage to a MOUD provider (at least one post-discharge MOUD visit, self-reported).\n- Self-reported buprenorphine-naloxone or naltrexone prescriptions filled.\n- Hospital readmission rates and number of ED visits.\n- Hospital-free days and ED-free days.\n- Recurrent opioid use, including self-reported relapse and frequency of use in the preceding 30 days.\n- Overall quality of life and psychological well-being measured by the Schwartz Outcome Scale-10 (SOS-10) and EQ-5D-5L.\n- Overdose events.\n- All-cause mortality.\n- Costs of care for the index admission and subsequent resource utilization (e.g., readmissions, ED use), as provided by institutional finance systems.\n\nAdditional infection-related outcomes among patients with injection-related infections considered for OPAT include:\n- New, persistent, or recurrent infection (based on positive cultures and/or change in antibiotic regimen).\n- Completion of antibiotic therapy.\n- Days from first negative blood culture to initial hospital discharge.\n\nImplementation outcomes include: willingness to accept referral to the bridge clinic, attendance rates among those offered bridge clinic care, cross-over between arms, and reasons for ineligibility or non-participation.\n\nFollow-up Procedures:\nAs part of routine addiction consult service practice, patients initiated on MOUD receive a 16-week follow-up phone call, regardless of trial arm. During this call, staff collect information on MOUD follow-up attendance, relapse to illicit opioid use, overdose occurrences, and self-reported quality of life metrics. Up to three call attempts are made, supplemented by text messages through institutional mobile devices or the patient portal to improve response rates. Alternative contacts are used when possible; some patients may be unreachable due to incarceration, death, or other barriers.\n\nStatistical Considerations:\nAnalyses will follow an intent-to-treat principle. The primary analysis will compare LOS between groups using generalized linear models with covariate adjustment; alternative models (e.g., proportional hazards or gamma with log link) may be used if LOS is strongly skewed. Binary secondary outcomes (e.g., linkage to MOUD, readmission, overdose) will be analyzed with logistic regression, ordinal outcomes with proportional odds models, and cost outcomes with models appropriate for skewed data (e.g., gamma or time-to-event approaches). Multiple imputation will address missing covariates. A two-sided significance level of 0.05 will be used for the primary endpoint.\n\nPower and Sample Size:\nInitial pre-implementation data suggested a mean LOS of 15 days (SD ~15). A sample size of 700 patients (350 per arm) was initially targeted to provide ≥80–90% power to detect clinically meaningful reductions in LOS (e.g., 3 days). Due to COVID-19-related disruptions and lower than expected enrollment, an interim blinded re-estimation found a mean LOS of 9 days (SD 11). Assuming a 1.5-day reduction in LOS is clinically meaningful, approximately 168 patients per group (336 total) would provide ≥80% power. With an accrual rate of ~4 patients per week, the revised sample size is considered achievable.\n\nEthics and Trial Status:\nThe study is conducted within the Vanderbilt Learning Healthcare System framework and is approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board with a waiver of informed consent (IRB #191269), recognizing that the intervention is an operational clinical program being evaluated pragmatically. Patients can decline attending the bridge clinic if offered, but participation in the randomized evaluation itself is not consent-based. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04084392). At the time of the report, the trial was ongoing with enrollment expected to complete in fall 2021.\n\nPlanned Dissemination:\nUpon completion, results will be published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at conferences, and posted on ClinicalTrials.gov. De-identified datasets and statistical code will be made available upon reasonable request with appropriate ethical approvals. Findings are intended to guide local and broader practice regarding integration of hospital-based addiction services and transitional bridge clinics for patients with OUD.""}","{""conditions"": [""Opioid Use Disorder"", ""Substance-Related Disorders"", ""Injection Drug Use"", ""Opioid-Related Disorders"", ""Substance Use Disorders"", ""Hospitalization"", ""Infective Endocarditis"", ""Drug-Related Infections""], ""keywords"": [""Opioid Use Disorder"", ""OUD"", ""Substance Use Disorder"", ""SUD"", ""Medications for Opioid Use Disorder"", ""MOUD"", ""Buprenorphine-Naloxone"", ""Naltrexone"", ""Addiction Consultation"", ""Bridge Clinic"", ""Transitional Care"", ""Continuity of Care"", ""Outpatient Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy"", ""OPAT"", ""Injection-Related Infections"", ""Hospital Length of Stay"", ""Readmission"", ""Emergency Department Visits"", ""Quality of Life"", ""Schwartz Outcome Scale-10"", ""SOS-10"", ""EQ-5D-5L"", ""Overdose"", ""Mortality"", ""Health Care Costs"", ""Pragmatic Clinical Trial""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Single-center, pragmatic, superiority randomized controlled trial with patients allocated 1:1 to referral to a co-located transitional multidisciplinary bridge clinic versus usual care with referral to community MOUD providers."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Open-label pragmatic trial; all providers are aware of the trial and of each patient's randomization status."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 336, ""type"": ""ESTIMATED""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Bridge Clinic Referral"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Hospitalized adults with opioid use disorder (OUD) who are initiated on medications for OUD (MOUD) by the addiction consult service and randomized to be offered referral to a co-located, transitional, multidisciplinary bridge clinic for post-acute care.

The study included people with knee pain caused by degenerative conditions (such as osteoarthritis or other non-surgical knee pathology) and those with persistent post-surgical pain after procedures like total knee arthroplasty. All patients first had to respond to a diagnostic nerve block before receiving RF. The main goal was to see how many patients reported at least 50% overall improvement at 6 weeks and how long any pain relief lasted. Secondary goals included changes in pain scores, use of strong opioids, functional improvement, need for additional procedures, and safety. About one-third of patients achieved meaningful clinical benefit, with an average duration of pain relief of about 8 months, and the procedure showed a favorable safety profile."", ""detailedDescription"": ""The RECORGEN trial is a retrospective observational cohort study conducted at the multidisciplinary chronic pain center of Hospital Oost-Limburg (Genk, Belgium) between September 1, 2017, and June 30, 2020. It investigates the effectiveness and safety of ultrasound-guided conventional radiofrequency (RF) ablation of the genicular nerves in patients with chronic anterior knee pain that is refractory to conventional medical management.\n\nTwo main etiologic subgroups were studied: (1) patients with persistent post-surgical knee pain (PPSP), most commonly following total knee arthroplasty (TKA), and (2) patients with degenerative knee pain (DP), including osteoarthritis, soft-tissue (e.g., ligament) disease, and post-traumatic knee pain. Patients with chronic widespread pain were excluded. Each treated knee (including bilateral and repeat procedures) was analyzed as a separate observation.\n\nBefore RF, all patients underwent diagnostic blocks of the superomedial, inferomedial, and superolateral genicular nerves using 2% lidocaine (1 ml per nerve). A positive response was defined as at least 50% pain reduction. Patients with a positive diagnostic response subsequently received conventional RF ablation of the same three genicular nerves. RF was performed under ultrasound guidance in sterile conditions without sedation, using a 10 cm 21G Cosman cannula with a 5 mm active tip. Sensory stimulation was used to confirm proximity to the target nerve (threshold \u001e0.5 V), and motor stimulation at 1.0 V was used to avoid motor fibers. RF lesions were applied at 70\u0000b0C for 90 seconds per nerve.\n\nBaseline data collection included age, sex, pain intensity on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), pain duration, indication (PPSP vs degenerative pain), use of strong opioids (all opioids except tramadol and codeine), and history of knee surgery. Follow-up assessments were performed at 6 weeks post-procedure for the entire cohort, and at a later cross-sectional \""second time point\"" (up to 27 months after RF) only for patients who reported treatment success at 6 weeks.\n\nThe primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with treatment success at 6 weeks, defined as a global perceived effect (GPE) of at least 50% improvement compared with baseline. GPE was rated from 0% to 100%. Secondary endpoints included: (1) proportion of patients with treatment success at the second time point; (2) proportion of patients achieving at least 50% reduction in NRS pain at 6 weeks and at the second time point; (3) subjective functional improvement at the second time point; (4) duration of the treatment effect in months; (5) changes in strong opioid use at 6 weeks and at the second time point; (6) need for additional invasive treatments (e.g., injections, platelet-rich plasma, surgery); and (7) adverse events (AEs) including type, frequency, and severity.\n\nIn total, 68 RF procedures were initially identified, with 61 included after exclusion of patients with chronic widespread pain. Fifty-nine procedures (13 degenerative pain, 46 PPSP) had complete 6-week follow-up and formed the main analysis set. Nineteen of 59 (32.2%) achieved the predefined treatment success based on GPE at 6 weeks, with similar success rates in degenerative (30.8%) and PPSP (32.6%) subgroups. Overall, 42.4% had some degree of improvement on GPE. NRS scores decreased significantly from a mean of 7.4 at baseline to 6.0 at 6 weeks (p=0.001) in the total cohort. A reduction in NRS of at least 50% at 6 weeks was observed in 22% of patients.\n\nResponders at 6 weeks were contacted by mail and telephone in October 2020 to obtain cross-sectional long-term outcome data. The mean time to this second assessment was 17 months (SD 10). Of the 19 initial responders, 17 provided follow-up data. At this second time point, 35.3% still met the GPE treatment success criterion, and 45.1% maintained a positive effect. The mean duration of RF treatment effect in the whole cohort was 8.3 months (SD 6.8). Some patients with temporary benefit received rescue treatments such as platelet-rich plasma or intra-articular corticosteroid injections; no patients proceeded to TKA during the observation window.\n\nConcerning functional outcomes, nearly half (47.1%) of the patients with initial treatment success reported improved functionality at the second time point, and most of them also reported ongoing pain improvement. Strong opioid use decreased from 27.1% of patients at baseline to 18.6% at 6 weeks, irrespective of treatment success, possibly reflecting optimization of non-cancer pain management. At long-term follow-up, 35.3% of followed patients used strong opioids, with some new initiations and some discontinuations, particularly within the PPSP group.\n\nThe safety profile of ultrasound-guided genicular nerve RF was generally favorable. At 6 weeks, therapy-related AEs were reported in 15.3% of patients, predominantly mild, localized, and transient. The most frequent AE was hypoesthesia (6.8%). Other isolated AEs included gait instability, increased pain, a self-limiting hematoma, and a flare of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) in a PPSP patient, the latter classified as a serious adverse event. At the second time point, no new AEs were reported; one patient noted persistent lateral knee paresthesia, while others reported resolution of earlier sensory symptoms.\n\nThe study highlights that conventional RF of three genicular nerves produces meaningful clinical benefit in slightly more than 30% of patients with refractory degenerative knee pain or PPSP in a real-world setting, with an average duration of effect of about 8 months and a low incidence of serious complications. The authors discuss potential reasons for lower success rates compared to earlier, mostly fluoroscopy-guided, prospective RF studies in osteoarthritis, including heterogeneity of the degenerative group, younger mean age, a learning curve for an ultrasound-guided technique, altered nerve anatomy and neuropathic mechanisms in PPSP, and the limited targeting of only three of the multiple genicular nerves innervating the anterior knee. They suggest that future research should refine patient selection, incorporate updated anatomical knowledge to target additional genicular branches, and evaluate long-term outcomes in larger, prospective cohorts.""}","{""conditions"": [""Osteoarthritis, Knee"", ""Chronic Pain"", ""Persistent Post-Surgical Pain"", ""Postoperative Pain"", ""Knee Injuries"", ""Ligament Injuries"", ""Post-Traumatic Pain"", ""Complex Regional Pain Syndromes""], ""keywords"": [""knee osteoarthritis"", ""chronic knee pain"", ""persistent post-surgical knee pain"", ""post-total knee arthroplasty pain"", ""radiofrequency ablation"", ""radiofrequency neurotomy"", ""genicular nerve"", ""ultrasound-guided procedures"", ""neuropathic pain"", ""degenerative knee disease"", ""postoperative complications"", ""opioid analgesics"", ""pain management"", ""functional outcome"", ""minimally invasive procedures""]}","{""studyType"": ""OBSERVATIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": ""P27M"", ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""NA"", ""interventionModel"": ""SINGLE_GROUP"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Retrospective single-center observational cohort of all consecutive patients with chronic knee pain who received ultrasound-guided conventional radiofrequency treatment of the three genicular nerves between September 1, 2017 and June 30, 2020; each treated knee/procedure considered a unique observation."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": ""COHORT"", ""timePerspective"": ""RETROSPECTIVE"", ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Retrospective cohort using data from medical records and follow-up questionnaires; no blinding or masking was described."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 59, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Radiofrequency treatment of the genicular nerves"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""Single-arm retrospective cohort of patients with chronic anterior knee pain (degenerative knee pain or persistent postsurgical pain) who underwent ultrasound-guided conventional radiofrequency treatment of three genicular nerves (superomedial, inferomedial, superolateral) following a positive diagnostic block."", ""interventionNames"": [""Ultrasound-guided conventional radiofrequency ablation of genicular nerves""]}], ""interventions"": [{""type"": ""PROCEDURE"", ""name"": ""Ultrasound-guided conventional radiofrequency ablation of genicular nerves"", ""description"": ""Ultrasound-guided conventional radiofrequency (RF) treatment targeting three anterior sensory genicular nerves (superomedial, inferomedial, and superolateral).

The primary goal was to determine whether RIST4721 reduces fresh and total pustule counts compared with placebo, reflecting a benefit in this neutrophil‑mediated inflammatory skin disease. Overall, RIST4721 was generally well tolerated but did not show superiority to placebo on the primary endpoints; exploratory and post hoc analyses in patients with progressing disease suggested a potential treatment effect."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This exploratory phase 2a clinical study investigated RIST4721, a small‑molecule CXC chemokine receptor type 2 (CXCR2) antagonist, as a potential oral treatment for palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP), a rare, chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by sterile pustules on the palms and soles and associated symptoms such as erythema, scaling, pain, and pruritus. PPP is strongly associated with smoking and driven in part by neutrophilic infiltration of the epidermis, with interleukin‑8 (IL‑8) and other CXCR2 ligands implicated in neutrophil recruitment and activation.\n\nThe trial (RIST4721‑201; NCT03988335) was a multicenter, randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled study conducted at sites in Canada and Germany. Adults 18–70 years of age with at least a 6‑month history of PPP, moderate to severe disease (Palmoplantar Pustulosis Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PPPASI] ≥ 8 and Palmoplantar Pustulosis Physician Global Assessment [PPPGA] ≥ 3), and predefined minimum numbers of fresh pustules (≥ 8 at screening and ≥ 20 at baseline) were eligible. Fresh pustules were defined as macroscopically visible white/yellow pustules without brown coloration, with or without crust, on the glabrous skin of palms and/or soles.\n\nEligible participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either RIST4721 300 mg oral solution or matching placebo once daily for 28 days, following an up to 30‑day screening period and a 14‑day post‑treatment follow‑up. The 300‑mg dose and once‑daily regimen were selected based on phase 1 pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data indicating dose‑dependent, reversible reductions in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) without causing moderate or severe neutropenia. Randomization was stratified by consent to skin biopsy collection.\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoints were the relative change from baseline to day 28 in fresh pustule count and total pustule count. Secondary endpoints included absolute change from baseline in fresh and total pustule counts at day 28, and the proportion of subjects achieving at least a 50% reduction in fresh and total pustule counts. Exploratory endpoints included the proportion of subjects achieving at least a 50% reduction in PPPASI (PPPASI‑50) and Palmoplantar Pustulosis Severity Index (PPSI) scores over time, changes in PPPGA, pain visual analogue scale (VAS), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and plasma concentrations of RIST4721.\n\nEfficacy analyses were conducted in the modified intent‑to‑treat population (all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study drug), using mixed‑model repeated measures for continuous outcomes and Fisher’s exact test for dichotomous response endpoints. Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations, vital signs, and electrocardiograms. Particular attention was paid to changes in ANC as an on‑target pharmacodynamic marker of CXCR2 blockade.\n\nA total of 35 subjects were randomized, and 34 received study treatment (15 RIST4721, 19 placebo). The majority were female and current smokers, consistent with known PPP epidemiology. Baseline mean fresh and total pustule counts and PPPASI/PPPGA scores indicated moderate to severe disease in both arms.\n\nTreatment with RIST4721 was generally well tolerated. A higher proportion of RIST4721‑treated subjects experienced treatment‑emergent AEs compared with placebo, most of which were mild gastrointestinal or musculoskeletal disorders and resolved without leading to treatment discontinuation. Two subjects in the RIST4721 group developed mild, transient, asymptomatic neutropenia; ANCs remained above 1.0 × 10^9/L and normalized by day 42. Mean ANC decreased in the RIST4721 arm but remained within the reference range, with no corresponding change in the placebo group, consistent with the expected pharmacologic effect of CXCR2 antagonism. No serious AEs or deaths occurred.\n\nFor the primary efficacy endpoints, no statistically significant differences were observed between RIST4721 and placebo at day 28. Mean relative changes from baseline in fresh pustule count were 0.86 (SD 0.692) for RIST4721 and 0.53 (SD 0.561) for placebo (P = 0.240), and in total pustule count were 0.99 (SD 0.667) and 0.96 (SD 0.672), respectively (P = 0.804). Secondary analyses similarly showed no significant advantage of RIST4721 over placebo; for example, the absolute reduction in fresh pustule count from baseline to day 28 was numerically smaller with RIST4721 (−2.1 ± 19.68) than with placebo (−18.3 ± 24.05; P = 0.053), and the proportion of patients achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in fresh pustule count at day 28 did not differ significantly between groups.\n\nPPPASI, PPSI, PPPGA, pain VAS, and DLQI scores improved over 28 days in both treatment arms, reflecting overall clinical benefit and placebo response, but without statistically significant differences between RIST4721 and placebo in the intent‑to‑treat population. A numerically higher proportion of RIST4721‑treated subjects achieved PPPASI‑50 at day 28 compared with placebo (40% vs 26.3%), but this difference did not reach statistical significance.\n\nGiven the fluctuating nature of PPP and the observation that some subjects improved between screening and baseline, a post hoc subgroup analysis was performed in patients with progressing disease, defined as an increase in total pustule count from screening to baseline. In this subgroup, the proportion of subjects achieving PPPASI‑50 at day 28 was significantly higher with RIST4721 (71%) than with placebo (15%) (P = 0.022), and improvement in pustule count on a target palm or sole was significantly greater with RIST4721. These findings suggest that RIST4721 may be more effective in patients experiencing active disease flares, potentially by blocking neutrophil migration to inflamed skin.\n\nThe study had several limitations, including a small sample size, short 28‑day treatment duration, and substantial inter‑ and intra‑subject variability in pustule counts. Counting fresh pustules proved challenging and may have introduced measurement variability and limited the power to detect differences. Future studies are suggested to include longer treatment periods, more homogeneous patient selection (possibly aided by central image review), and alternative or additional endpoints such as PPPASI and PPPGA to better capture disease activity and treatment response.\n\nIn conclusion, once‑daily RIST4721 300 mg oral solution for 28 days was generally well tolerated in adults with moderate to severe PPP and produced expected, reversible reductions in neutrophil counts. Although the primary efficacy endpoints were not met in the overall study population, exploratory and post hoc analyses in patients with progressing disease provide preliminary evidence that RIST4721 may have clinical benefit in PPP, warranting further evaluation in larger and longer‑term clinical trials.""}","{""conditions"": [""Palmoplantar pustulosis""], ""keywords"": [""Palmoplantar pustulosis"", ""PPP"", ""Neutrophilic dermatoses"", ""Neutrophil-mediated inflammatory disease"", ""CXCR2 antagonist"", ""CXC chemokine receptor type 2"", ""Interleukin-8"", ""IL-8"", ""Pustular psoriasis of the palms and soles"", ""Palmoplantar Pustulosis Psoriasis Area and Severity Index"", ""PPPASI"", ""Palmoplantar Pustulosis Physician Global Assessment"", ""PPPGA"", ""Palmoplantar Pustulosis Severity Index"", ""PPSI"", ""RIST4721""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Two-arm, parallel-group trial with subjects randomized 1:1 to oral RIST4721 300 mg once daily or placebo for 28 days."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Double-blind study in which both participants and study personnel were unaware of treatment allocation (RIST4721 vs placebo)."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT"", ""CARE_PROVIDER"", ""INVESTIGATOR"", ""OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 35, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""RIST4721 300 mg once daily"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Adult subjects with moderate to severe palmoplantar pustulosis received oral RIST4721 300 mg solution once daily for 28 days."", ""interventionNames"": [""RIST4721 oral solution 300 mg""]}, {""label"": ""Placebo once daily"", ""type"": ""PLACEBO_COMPARATOR"", ""description"": ""Adult subjects with moderate to severe palmoplantar pustulosis received matching oral placebo solution once daily for 28 days."", ""interventionNames"": [""Placebo oral solution""]}], ""interventions"": [{""type"": ""DRUG"", ""name"": ""RIST4721 oral solution 300 mg"", ""description"": ""RIST4721, a small molecule CXCR2 antagonist, administered as a 300 mg oral solution once daily for 28 days to treat moderate to severe palmoplantar pustulosis."", ""armGroupLabels"": [""RIST4721 300 mg once daily""]}, {""type"": ""DRUG"", ""name"": ""Placebo oral solution"", ""description"": ""Matching placebo oral solution administered once daily for 28 days, used as a comparator to RIST4721 in subjects with moderate to severe palmoplantar pustulosis."", ""armGroupLabels"": [""Placebo once daily""]}]}","{""primaryOutcomes"": [{""measure"": ""Relative change from baseline in fresh pustule count"", ""description"": ""Relative change from baseline in the number of fresh pustules on the palms and/or soles, where fresh pustules are defined as macroscopically visible pustules that are white/yellow in color with no brown color, with or without crust, present on the glabrous skin of the palms and/or soles."", ""timeFrame"": ""Day 28""}, {""measure"": ""Relative change from baseline in total pustule count"", ""description"": ""Relative change from baseline in the total number of pustules (fresh plus non-fresh) on the palms and/or soles."", ""timeFrame"": ""Day 28""}], ""secondaryOutcomes"": [{""measure"": ""Absolute change from baseline in fresh pustule count"", ""description"": ""Absolute change from baseline in the number of fresh pustules on the palms and/or soles."", ""timeFrame"": ""Day 28""}, {""measure"": ""Absolute change from baseline in total pustule count"", ""description"": ""Absolute change from baseline in the total number of pustules (fresh plus non-fresh) on the palms and/or soles."", ""timeFrame"": ""Day 28""}, {""measure"": ""Proportion of subjects achieving at least a 50% reduction in fresh pustule count"", ""description"": ""Proportion of subjects with at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the number of fresh pustules on the palms and/or soles."", ""timeFrame"": ""Day 28""}, {""measure"": ""Proportion of subjects achieving at least a 50% reduction in total pustule count"", ""description"": ""Proportion of subjects with at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the total number of pustules (fresh plus non-fresh) on the palms and/or soles."", ""timeFrame"": ""Day 28""}], ""otherOutcomes"": [{""measure"": ""Proportion of subjects achieving PPPASI-50"", ""description"": ""Proportion of subjects achieving at least a 50% reduction from baseline in Palmoplantar Pustulosis Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PPPASI)."", ""timeFrame"": ""Each visit (Days 7, 14, 21, and 28;

The app combines HIV prevention information, automated reminders, and a mobile phone imaging feature that interprets the results of at-home OraQuick HIV self-tests and provides real-time feedback and guidance. Participants are randomized to: (1) mLab App plus HIV home test kits and standard preventive care, (2) standard preventive care only, or (3) HIV home test kits plus standard preventive care. The main hypothesis is that access to the mLab App will increase the proportion of youth who test for HIV and improve linkage to confirmatory testing and care among those with reactive results."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This study tests the effectiveness of the mLab App, a mobile phone-based, FDA-regulated investigational device, in improving HIV testing behaviors and linkage to care among Black, Latino, and other young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and young transgender women (YTGW) aged 18–29 years living in and around New York City and Chicago. These populations bear a disproportionate burden of HIV in the United States and face substantial social (e.g., stigma, homophobia, transphobia, racism) and healthcare system barriers (e.g., limited youth-centered HIV services) to HIV testing and care.\n\nThe mLab App integrates HIV prevention education, email/text reminders, and an automated image-processing algorithm that analyzes photographs of completed OraQuick rapid home HIV self-tests. Users log in with assigned credentials, receive personalized greetings, see their intervention progress, access daily HIV prevention facts, and receive automated reminders to test every 3 months. After performing an OraQuick self-test, participants visually interpret their test following manufacturer instructions, then upload a photo to the app. The app’s algorithm provides an experimental, real-time interpretation of the test image and sends both the user and research team the interpreted result to support ongoing monitoring, repeat testing for non-reactive tests, and rapid linkage to confirmatory testing and treatment for reactive tests. The app’s automated data collection feature captures user-submitted test results and images for further analysis.\n\nThe trial uses a three-arm randomized controlled design with 525 participants allocated in a 2:2:1 ratio, stratified by site (Chicago, NYC): Arm 1 receives the mLab App, two OraQuick home HIV tests at baseline plus two more at 6 months, and standard HIV preventive care; Arm 2 receives standard preventive care only; Arm 3 receives two OraQuick home HIV tests at baseline plus two more at 6 months and standard preventive care, but not the app. Standard preventive care for all arms at baseline includes in-person HIV testing, HIV prevention and testing education (including PrEP information), condoms, and links to mobile-optimized CDC HIV prevention resources. All participants are scheduled for follow-up assessments at 6 and 12 months, with brief check-ins via text at 2, 4, 8, and 10 months.\n\nEligibility criteria include age 18–29 years, assigned male sex at birth (any current gender identity), English proficiency, smartphone ownership, self-reported HIV-negative or unknown status (confirmed by baseline HIV testing), and being sexually active and at risk for HIV infection per CDC guidance (e.g., YMSM or YTGW with recent anal sex with men). Individuals with known HIV infection or for whom participation is judged potentially detrimental are excluded.\n\nThe primary outcome is the proportion of participants who self-report having been tested for HIV in the previous 6 months. For participants in the mLab App arm, self-reported testing is cross-checked with uploaded test images. The study will describe potential bias in self-report and characterize the app’s test interpretation performance. Secondary analyses include comparing HIV testing frequency across arms, evaluating linkage to care among those with reactive tests (measured as the proportion attending an HIV care appointment and time to linkage), and assessing the sensitivity and specificity of four methods of result interpretation: user self-reading, study team reading of uploaded images, automated mLab algorithm, and confirmatory laboratory testing (gold standard). McNemar’s test will compare paired sensitivities and specificities across these methods.\n\nAnalyses will use an intention-to-treat framework. Logistic regression models will compare HIV testing rates between the mLab App arm and control arms, with subgroup analyses by race/ethnicity, age, gender group (YMSM vs YTGW), and risk level. Multiple imputation will address missing data under a missing-at-random assumption, and sensitivity analyses based on selection models for dropout will assess robustness. Because the number of expected HIV-positive cases is relatively small (approximately 25–40), linkage-to-care comparisons may not be powered to detect statistically significant differences.\n\nThe trial is conducted under FDA oversight because the mLab App functions as a diagnostic support tool for HIV self-testing. The device operates under an FDA Investigational Device Exemption (IDE #18348), with labeling specifying that the participant’s visual interpretation of the OraQuick test is the reference for their result. The study aims to generate evidence on whether combining at-home HIV testing with a tailored mobile app can increase HIV testing uptake and improve linkage to care among high-risk youth, and to inform the broader use and regulation of mobile medical apps in HIV prevention, particularly in contexts where in-person services are limited, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic.""}","{""conditions"": [""HIV Infections"", ""HIV Testing"", ""High-Risk Sexual Behavior"", ""Men who have Sex with Men"", ""Transgender Persons""], ""keywords"": [""HIV"", ""HIV Infections"", ""HIV Self-Testing"", ""OraQuick"", ""Mobile Health"", ""mHealth"", ""Mobile Applications"", ""HIV Prevention"", ""HIV Screening"", ""Young Adult"", ""Men who have Sex with Men"", ""Transgender Women"", ""Linkage to Care"", ""Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis"", ""PrEP"", ""United States"", ""New York City"", ""Chicago"", ""Racial and Ethnic Minorities"", ""Black"", ""Latino""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Three-arm randomized controlled trial with participants allocated in a 2:2:1 ratio to: (1) mLab App + HIV home test kits + standard preventive care, (2) standard preventive care only, or (3) HIV home test kits + standard preventive care only."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""DIAGNOSTIC"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""No blinding is described; participants and study staff are aware of assigned study arm and the specific components provided (app access, home test kits, or standard care only)."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 525, ""type"": ""ESTIMATED""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""mLab App + HIV home test kits + standard of preventive care"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Participants receive access to the mLab mobile app plus two OraQuick HIV home test kits at baseline (and two additional OraQuick kits at 6 months), along with standard HIV preventive care, including HIV testing education, condoms, and PrEP education.

Recrudescence at lower doses was associated with emergent mutations in the parasite eEF2 gene, supporting further development of M5717 in combination regimens or for prophylaxis."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This study was a first-in-human clinical trial designed to characterise the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antimalarial activity of M5717 (formerly DDD107498), a novel inhibitor of Plasmodium translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2). M5717 has shown potent in vitro and in vivo activity against multiple Plasmodium species life-cycle stages and favourable preclinical pharmacokinetics.\n\nThe trial, conducted at a single centre in Brisbane, Australia, comprised two executed parts:\n\nPart A: Single Ascending Dose (SAD) Study\n- Design: Double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study.\n- Population: Healthy men and women of non-childbearing potential, 18–55 years; in practice, all enrolled were male.\n- Randomisation: Within each cohort, participants were randomised 3:1 to a single oral dose of M5717 or matching placebo, with sentinel dosing (one active and one placebo) per cohort before dosing the remainder.\n- Dosing cohorts: 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 1000, 1250, 1800, and 2100 mg. The 2100 mg cohort was limited to the two sentinel participants due to emerging transient neurological adverse events.\n- Procedures: Participants fasted ≥8 hours before dosing and received M5717 or placebo capsules with water, then remained inpatient for intensive safety and pharmacokinetic sampling, followed by outpatient follow-up.\n- Primary outcome: Safety and tolerability, including frequency and severity of adverse events, and changes in vital signs, ECGs, and clinical laboratory parameters.\n- Secondary outcomes: Pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, tmax, AUC, t1/2, CL/F, Vz/F, and time above preclinically predicted MIC [3 ng/mL] and minimum parasiticidal concentration [10 ng/mL]).\n\nPart C: Volunteer Infection Study (VIS) Using Induced Blood-Stage Malaria\n- Design: Open-label, non-randomised study employing the Plasmodium falciparum induced blood-stage malaria model.\n- Population: Healthy, malaria-naive adults (all enrolled were male) aged 18–55 years.\n- Malaria challenge: Participants were inoculated intravenously with P. falciparum–infected erythrocytes (approximately 2800 viable parasites). Parasitaemia was monitored by qPCR for P. falciparum 18S rRNA.\n- Dosing cohorts: Following safety and PK review from the SAD part, three dose cohorts were selected—400 mg (first VIS cohort), 150 mg (second cohort, to refine exposure–response), and 800 mg (third cohort, to further define the exposure–response relationship). Each participant received a single oral dose of M5717 when parasitaemia was expected to be at least 5000 parasites/mL (actual baseline parasitaemia varied by cohort).\n- Rescue therapy: All participants subsequently received artemether–lumefantrine either upon recrudescence or at day 21 after M5717 dosing if no recrudescence occurred.\n- Primary VIS outcomes: Pharmacokinetics of M5717 and parasite clearance kinetics, quantified by the parasite reduction ratio over 48 hours (PRR48) and parasite clearance half-life, with explicit modelling of a biphasic clearance pattern using segmented (piecewise) regression and random-effects meta-analysis.\n- Secondary VIS outcomes: Safety and tolerability; incidence and timing of recrudescence up to day 28; malaria clinical score (to be reported elsewhere); and estimation of MIC, minimum parasiticidal concentration, parasite clearance time, and lag phase using pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic modelling.\n- Exploratory outcomes: Sequencing of the parasite PfeEF2 gene in recrudescent isolates to detect resistance-associated mutations.\n\nKey Findings\n\nSafety and Tolerability:\n- No serious adverse events occurred, and no participant discontinued due to adverse events. All treatment-related events were mild or moderate and transient.\n- In the SAD study, 76% of M5717 recipients and 76% of placebo recipients experienced at least one adverse event. M5717-related events were infrequent up to 1250 mg. No treatment-related events were reported at 50, 100, or 200 mg; low rates were observed at 400–1250 mg; all participants receiving 1800 or 2100 mg reported at least one M5717-related event.\n- The most common M5717-related adverse events were headache, blurred vision, dizziness, and oral hypoesthesia. Transient oral hypoesthesia and blurred vision occurred only at 1800 and 2100 mg and were considered previously unrecognised, concentration-related neurological risks, prompting suspension of further escalation beyond the sentinel 2100 mg cohort.\n- In the VIS, almost all participants experienced adverse events, predominantly mild-to-moderate malaria-like symptoms (e.g., fever, chills, myalgias) that diminished over about 7 days after dosing. Only one VIS participant (400 mg cohort) had an event assessed as related to M5717 (mild, self-limiting rhinorrhoea).\n\nPharmacokinetics:\n- Following single oral dosing, M5717 was rapidly absorbed, with median tmax between 1 and 7 hours across dose groups.\n- Blood concentration–time profiles showed an initial peak around 2 hours, followed by a biexponential decline with secondary peaks (around 6–10 hours and ~30 hours), suggesting complex absorption or distribution processes.\n- Exposure (AUC and Cmax) increased approximately dose-proportionally, with slight greater-than-proportionality suggested by formal assessment.\n- The apparent terminal half-life was long: at doses >200 mg it ranged approximately 146–193 hours, confirming a substantially longer half-life in humans than in preclinical species. At lower doses, t1/2 estimates were less reliable due to early fall of concentrations below the assay lower limit of quantification.\n- The apparent volume of distribution was large (approximately 6–9 L/kg equivalent), and clearance was low relative to typical hepatic blood flow.\n- Time above the mouse-estimated MIC (3 ng/mL) and minimum parasiticidal concentration (10 ng/mL) increased with dose; at doses ≥150 mg, all participants had concentrations ≥3 ng/mL for at least 7 days; at doses ≥400 mg, all had concentrations ≥10 ng/mL for at least 7 days.\n\nAntimalarial Activity (VIS):\n- All participants in the VIS achieved initial clearance of asexual blood-stage P. falciparum parasitaemia after a single M5717 dose. Parasite clearance followed a biphasic pattern in all dose groups: an initial slow clearance phase lasting approximately 35–55 hours, followed by a faster clearance phase.\n- The breakpoint between slow and fast phases occurred later at higher doses (approximately 36 hours at 150 mg vs about 54–56 hours at 400–800 mg). Parasite clearance was substantially faster in the second phase in all cohorts.\n- In the 800 mg cohort, the first-phase parasite clearance half-life was estimated at 24.7 hours, with PRR48 of 3.86; the second-phase half-life was 5.5 hours with much higher PRR48, indicating a potent killing phase once the lag was overcome.\n- Recrudescence occurred in 3 of 6 participants at 150 mg and 2 of 8 at 400 mg, with onset around 10–19 days after dosing; no recrudescence was observed up to 21 days in the 800 mg cohort.\n- All recrudescent infections were successfully treated with artemether–lumefantrine, and all participants were aparasitaemic by end of study.\n\nResistance Findings:\n- Sequencing of the full-length PfeEF2 gene in recrudescent parasite populations revealed single-nucleotide polymorphisms in four of the five cases (two at 150 mg and two at 400 mg), producing amino acid substitutions at positions 134, 183, 474, and 754. These positions coincide with or are near mutations previously associated with M5717 resistance in vitro and were generally linked to reduced susceptibility (5–40-fold increases in inhibitory concentrations) and some fitness cost.\n- The emergence of PfeEF2 mutations under single-dose exposure supports the need for combination therapy with a fast-acting partner drug to limit resistance selection.\n\nConclusions and Implications:\n- M5717 is generally well tolerated as a single oral dose in healthy adults up to 1250 mg and has an exceptionally long half-life, supporting potential single-dose use.\n- A single 800 mg dose effectively cleared low-density induced blood-stage P. falciparum infections in malaria-naive adults without recrudescence over 21 days and with a characteristic biphasic clearance pattern reflecting the compound’s mode of action (inhibition of protein synthesis and possible lag before functional parasite death).\n- The observed emergence of resistance-associated PfeEF2 mutations in recrudescent parasites following lower-dose monotherapy highlights the importance of deploying M5717 in combination with a rapidly acting antimalarial partner with a distinct target.\n- Future studies are warranted to evaluate M5717-containing combinations in patients with clinical malaria, as well as its potential roles in chemoprotection, prophylaxis, and transmission blocking, including evaluation across sexes and diverse endemic populations, and assessment of food effects and drug–drug interactions (particularly via CYP3A4).""}","{""conditions"": [""Malaria"", ""Malaria, Falciparum"", ""Plasmodium falciparum infection""], ""keywords"": [""M5717"", ""DDD107498"", ""Malaria"", ""Malaria, Falciparum"", ""Plasmodium falciparum"", ""Plasmodium infections"", ""Antimalarials"", ""Drug Resistance, Parasite"", ""Protozoan Proteins"", ""Elongation Factor 2"", ""Protein Synthesis Inhibitors"", ""Chemoprevention"", ""Malaria Prophylaxis"", ""Volunteer infection study"", ""Induced blood-stage malaria"", ""Pharmacokinetics"", ""Parasite Clearance"", ""Parasite Reduction Ratio"", ""Recrudescence""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE1""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""First-in-human two-part trial: Part A was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single ascending oral dose study with parallel M5717 vs placebo groups within nine dose cohorts; Part C was an open-label, non-randomized, single-group volunteer infection study using the induced blood-stage malaria model with three sequential M5717 dose cohorts."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": ""COHORT"", ""timePerspective"": ""PROSPECTIVE"", ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Part A used double-blind masking with participants and investigators blinded to M5717 vs placebo; treatment identity concealed by identical packaging and appearance.

Participants were randomized to receive sugammadex at 2, 4, or 16 mg/kg (16 mg/kg for rocuronium only) or neostigmine plus glycopyrrolate for reversal of neuromuscular block. The main focus was on treatment-emergent cardiac rhythm changes, including sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, and other arrhythmias, as well as other adverse events of clinical interest, to determine if sugammadex has a favorable cardiac and overall safety profile compared with neostigmine/glycopyrrolate in this medically vulnerable population."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This trial was a randomized, active comparator-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind safety study conducted at 27 sites in four countries between December 2017 and September 2019 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03346057). It enrolled adult men and women (≥18 years, BMI <40 kg/m²) scheduled for surgical procedures requiring moderate or deep neuromuscular block with rocuronium or vecuronium who were classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Class 3 (severe systemic disease) or 4 (severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life).\n\nParticipants were stratified by ASA class (3 vs 4) and by neuromuscular blocking agent (rocuronium vs vecuronium), then randomized via an interactive voice response system to one of several maintenance/reversal combinations. Within the rocuronium stratum, patients were assigned in a 2:1:2:2 ratio to: (1) moderate neuromuscular block with reversal using sugammadex 2 mg/kg; (2) moderate neuromuscular block with reversal using neostigmine (50 µg/kg, up to 5 mg) plus glycopyrrolate (10 µg/kg, up to 1 mg); (3) deep neuromuscular block with reversal using sugammadex 4 mg/kg; or (4) deep neuromuscular block with reversal using sugammadex 16 mg/kg (the dose indicated for urgent reversal of high-dose rocuronium). Within the vecuronium stratum, patients were randomized in a 2:1:2 ratio to moderate block with sugammadex 2 mg/kg, moderate block with neostigmine/glycopyrrolate, or deep block with sugammadex 4 mg/kg. Vecuronium was not paired with the 16 mg/kg sugammadex dose because that dose is only indicated for high-dose rocuronium.\n\nAnesthesiologists were blinded to the reversal agent in the moderate block arms and to the sugammadex dose in the deep block arms; a separate safety assessor was blinded to all treatment assignments, depth of block, and drug preparation. Neuromuscular block was maintained per local practice, targeting train-of-four (TOF) counts of 1–3 for moderate block and post-tetanic count <5 for deep block. Reversal was given as an intravenous bolus (in two masked syringes) within 5 minutes after TOF count reappeared at 1–4 (moderate block) or when post-tetanic count was ≥1 with TOF count 0 (deep block).\n\nThe primary safety endpoints were the incidences of treatment-emergent (TE) sinus bradycardia, TE sinus tachycardia, and other TE cardiac arrhythmias occurring from just before through 35 minutes after administration of the reversal agent. Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring began at least 5 minutes before and continued for at least 30 minutes after study drug administration. Sinus bradycardia was defined as heart rate <60/min or a >20% decrease from baseline; sinus tachycardia as heart rate ≥100/min or a >20% increase from baseline; and other arrhythmias as new or worsened rhythm disturbances (e.g., atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation). Events had to be sustained for at least 1 minute to be counted.\n\nPre-specified events of clinical interest (ECIs) included clinically relevant (CR) arrhythmias (sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, or other arrhythmias requiring intervention), potential hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis (adjudicated by an external blinded committee), and drug-induced liver injury defined by protocol-specified liver function test thresholds. Additional safety assessments included general adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), laboratory parameters (including liver tests and creatinine clearance), and vital signs up to 7 days post-treatment, with supplemental AE follow-up through 14 days.\n\nThe All Participants as Treated population comprised 331 treated patients (61% male, mean BMI 28.5 kg/m², mean age 69 years; 67% ≥65 years; approximately 75% ASA Class 3 and 25% ASA Class 4). Rocuronium was used in 231 and vecuronium in 100 participants.\n\nTE cardiac rhythm events were infrequent. Compared with neostigmine/glycopyrrolate, sugammadex 2 mg/kg was associated with a significantly lower incidence of TE sinus bradycardia. Sugammadex 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg were both associated with significantly lower incidences of TE sinus tachycardia than neostigmine/glycopyrrolate. No statistically significant differences were observed between sugammadex groups and neostigmine/glycopyrrolate for other TE cardiac arrhythmias. These findings were generally consistent across ASA class (3 vs 4) and neuromuscular blocking agent (rocuronium vs vecuronium) strata.\n\nClinically relevant arrhythmias and other ECIs were rare in all treatment arms. No cases of adjudicated hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis and no cases of drug-induced liver injury occurred. Liver enzyme and bilirubin elevations were uncommon and similar across groups. No participants developed creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min up to 14 days post-treatment, and no clinically meaningful effects on vital signs were attributed to sugammadex.\n\nOverall adverse event and serious adverse event rates up to 7 days were similar among treatments, with no meaningful imbalances in drug-related AEs. Two deaths occurred in patients who received sugammadex (one each in the 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg groups); investigators judged both to be unrelated to study medication. One serious drug-related AE (cardiac arrest) occurred in the 16 mg/kg sugammadex group and resolved.\n\nThe study concluded that in ASA Class 3 and 4 surgical patients, sugammadex demonstrates a favorable safety and tolerability profile, including cardiac safety, for reversal of moderate and deep rocuronium- or vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block. The incidences of TE sinus bradycardia and sinus tachycardia were lower with sugammadex at labeled doses than with neostigmine/glycopyrrolate, and there were no excess risks identified for other arrhythmias, hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, or hepatic injury. These data support the use of sugammadex in higher-risk surgical populations.""}","{""conditions"": [""Postoperative Complications"", ""Cardiac Arrhythmias"", ""Sinus Bradycardia"", ""Sinus Tachycardia"", ""Neuromuscular Blockade"", ""Rocuronium"", ""Vecuronium"", ""Anesthesia"", ""ASA Physical Status Classification System Class III"", ""ASA Physical Status Classification System Class IV""], ""keywords"": [""Sugammadex"", ""Neostigmine"", ""Glycopyrrolate"", ""Neuromuscular Block Reversal"", ""Rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade"", ""Vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade"", ""Sinus bradycardia"", ""Sinus tachycardia"", ""Cardiac arrhythmias"", ""Treatment-emergent arrhythmias"", ""Hypersensitivity"", ""Anaphylaxis"", ""Drug-induced liver injury"", ""American Society of Anesthesiologists Class 3"", ""American Society of Anesthesiologists Class 4"", ""Perioperative safety"", ""Anesthesia recovery"", ""Cyclodextrins"", ""Modified cyclodextrin""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""PHASE4""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Randomized, active comparator-controlled, multi-site, parallel-group safety study with four treatment arms (three sugammadex dose regimens and one neostigmine/glycopyrrolate regimen), stratified by ASA class and neuromuscular blocking agent (rocuronium or vecuronium)."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Double-blind study: anesthesiologist was blinded to reversal agent in moderate block arms and to sugammadex dose in deep block arms;

The study aims to determine which intervention type and intensity works best for which women and whether adding text and phone support improves outcomes for early non-responders."", ""detailedDescription"": ""The trial tests weWomen Plus, an adaptive, multi-component, technology-based intervention designed for foreign-born immigrant women in the U.S. who have experienced intimate partner violence (IPV) in the past 12 months. The intervention is trauma-informed and culturally tailored to address the unique risks, barriers, and safety planning needs of immigrant women, including those related to immigration status, language, cultural norms, lack of familiarity with U.S. systems, and limited social support.\n\nDesign and randomization:\nThe study uses a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design to optimize intervention type and intensity based on participant response. In the first randomization stage, eligible women (aged 18–64, immigrant, IPV within past year, with safe access to internet-enabled devices and phone/text) are randomized to either:\n1) An online/web-based intervention website delivering a culturally adapted version of the myPlan safety decision and planning app; or\n2) A control website with usual safety planning information modeled on national and state domestic violence resources (no Danger Assessment-based tailoring).\n\nData are collected via web or smartphone-based questionnaires at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. Primary outcomes include severity and frequency of IPV and measures of empowerment; secondary outcomes include depression and PTSD symptoms.\n\nIntervention components:\nThe core online component is a culturally adapted myPlan app. myPlan is grounded in Dutton’s empowerment model and includes: (a) education on relationship \""red flags\""; (b) a validated Danger Assessment (DA) adapted for immigrant women to estimate risk for severe or lethal IPV, with immediate feedback on danger level; and (c) a priority-setting activity to help women clarify what matters most (e.g., children’s safety, resources, health). Inputs are combined via an evidence-based algorithm to produce a tailored safety plan with links to local (when available) and national resources. An onboarding process provides guidance on safe technology use and requires creation of a PIN-protected login.\n\nWomen initially allocated to usual care receive standard, non-tailored online safety planning resources, including risk assessment items based on formative research identifying additional immigrant-specific risk factors, but they do not receive DA-informed tailored planning.\n\nSecond-stage randomization for non-responders:\nAt 3 months, women in both initial arms are classified as responders or non-responders based on changes from baseline in IPV severity/frequency and empowerment. Non-response is defined as less than a 0.25 standard deviation improvement in both decreased IPV and increased empowerment. Women who are non-responders are re-randomized to one of two additional, technology-delivered supports:\n1) A structured text messaging intervention; or\n2) A combination of the same text messaging plus two phone sessions with a trained facilitator.\n\nResponders continue with their original allocation and complete further follow-up assessments only.\n\nText messaging intervention:\nThe text component is based on an empowerment and strengths-based framework, informed by a psychosocial readiness model. Over 4 weeks, women receive tailored weekly text sessions at pre-selected safe times. Sessions assess current feelings of safety, readiness to take safety actions, past use and barriers to safety strategies, and self-perceived danger. Messages provide information on safety planning elements, local and national resources, formal and informal supports, and self-care strategies for mental and physical health. If a woman rates her future risk of severe violence higher than a specified threshold, she receives a short form of the Danger Assessment to further evaluate risk. Content is tailored according to readiness to change, usefulness of prior resources, living situation and relationship status. All text sessions end with emergency resource information and safety reminders (e.g., deleting messages).\n\nPhone call intervention:\nThe phone component augments the text messages and is delivered by trained facilitators using a trauma-informed, strengths-based, motivational enhancement and solution-focused approach. Two calls are conducted: the first one week after completion of the text series, and the second one week later. In the first call, facilitators build rapport, validate experiences, highlight strengths and protective factors, reframe deficits, explore primary concerns, use scaling questions to enhance motivation, encourage \""change talk,\"" and collaboratively establish realistic, participant-driven goals related to safety and well-being. Safety assessment is conducted during each call. The second call reviews progress toward goals, identifies barriers, explores exceptions (times when problems are less severe), and reinforces both general and culturally specific strengths and resources, while refining safety and empowerment strategies.\n\nOutcomes and measures:\nPrimary outcomes:\n- Severity and frequency of IPV: measured with an adapted Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2), including subscales for physical aggression, injury, psychological aggression, and sexual coercion. Frequency in the past 12 months is recorded with standard CTS2 categories, and items are aggregated using severity-times-frequency weighted scores.\n- Empowerment (overall): assessed with the Personal Progress Scale-Revised (PPS-R), a 28-item self-report measure capturing self-evaluation, self-esteem, emotional regulation, cultural and gender identity awareness, self-efficacy, self-care, problem-solving, assertiveness, and access to resources. Items are rated from 1 (Almost Never) to 7 (Almost Always), summed to yield higher scores for greater empowerment.\n- Empowerment related to safety: measured with the 13-item Measure of Victim Empowerment Related to Safety (MOVERS), which assesses safety-related goal-setting, perceived ability to accomplish safety goals, perceived costs or difficulties triggered by safety efforts, and knowledge of and access to supports. Items are rated from 1 (never true) to 5 (always true), with higher total scores indicating greater safety-related empowerment.\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n- Depression: assessed using the PHQ-9, a 9-item measure of depressive symptoms over the past 2 weeks, scored 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day); total scores reflect depression severity.\n- Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): assessed with the 16-item Harvard Trauma Questionnaire PTSD subscale, measuring symptoms over the past week in intrusion, avoidance/numbing, and hyperarousal domains, with items scored from 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Extremely); higher scores indicate more severe PTSD symptoms.\n\nAnalysis plan:\nPrimary analyses follow intention-to-treat principles. T-tests and chi-square tests will assess baseline balance across randomized groups. Missing data will be addressed using multiple imputation via Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods, with predictors of missingness included in models. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) with robust variance estimation will evaluate group-by-time interactions for primary and secondary outcomes, comparing the online/web-based myPlan adaptation versus usual care across 3, 6, and 12 months.\n\nLogistic regression will identify baseline predictors of non-response (for safety and empowerment) among those assigned to the online intervention in the first stage, including demographics, acculturation, attitudes toward violence against women, and social support. These predictors will also be used as covariates in subsequent models.\n\nTo test the effect of adaptive augmentation for non-responders, GEE models will compare three groups: (1) initial responders from both original arms, (2) non-responders re-randomized to text messaging alone, and (3) non-responders re-randomized to text plus phone. Analyses will assess whether non-responders who receive additional support can reach outcomes comparable to initial responders. A weighted and replicated estimation method will be used to simultaneously estimate effects of embedded adaptive interventions, with inverse probability weights based on the number of randomizations.\n\nSample size and power:\nInvestigators estimate that 30% of women in the online intervention arm will be non-responders at 3 months. With 80% retention at 12 months and an effect size of 0.25, a sample of 253 participants per first-stage group (total N=1266; 633 per arm) provides 80% power (alpha=0.05) to detect differences in change over time between the online myPlan intervention and usual care. Under these assumptions, approximately 190 non-responders from the intervention arm will be re-randomized (95 per text-only vs. text+phone), and 316 non-responders in the control arm (158 per text-only vs. text+phone), allowing detection of small-to-moderate effects, particularly for the phone-augmented condition.\n\nSafety, ethics, and data monitoring:\nThe study is approved by the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine IRB. Participants provide verbal and electronic written consent. Safety protocols include guidance on private and secure use of devices, safe timing and modes of contact, and confidentiality procedures (use of non-identifying study IDs, separate storage of contact and survey data, SSL encryption, and strict access control). Women may stop participation at any time. The team performs periodic safety check-ins, provides information about emergency and IPV support resources, and follows a structured suicide risk protocol. Mandated reporting procedures apply for identified child abuse or imminent risk of suicide or homicide.\n\nA Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) comprising independent experts in ethics, intervention research, biostatistics, and immigrant/IPV work oversees participant safety and protocol adherence. The DSMB reviews interim analyses approximately every 6 months and may recommend continuing, modifying, or stopping the trial based on safety or other concerns.\n\nImplications:\nThis trial aims to generate rigorous evidence on a culturally tailored, adaptive, technology-based intervention for immigrant women exposed to IPV, addressing a major gap in IPV and immigrant health research. By leveraging web, text, and phone modalities in a SMART design, the study seeks to identify which combinations and intensities of support best improve safety, mental health, and empowerment for diverse immigrant women, and to inform scalable interventions for healthcare, social service, and IPV-focused settings.""}","{""conditions"": [""Intimate Partner Violence"", ""Domestic Violence"", ""Depression"", ""Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders"", ""Violence Against Women"", ""Homicide Risk""], ""keywords"": [""Intimate Partner Violence"", ""Domestic Violence"", ""Immigrants"", ""Women"", ""Trauma-Informed Care"", ""Empowerment"", ""Safety Planning"", ""Mobile Applications"", ""Text Messaging"", ""Telemedicine"", ""Depression"", ""Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder"", ""Mental Health"", ""Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial"", ""SMART design"", ""Technology-Based Intervention"", ""Culturally Tailored Intervention"", ""Danger Assessment"", ""myPlan"", ""Psychosocial Readiness""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""SEQUENTIAL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) in two stages.

Patients were treated for 8 weeks with secukinumab 150 mg or placebo; from Week 8 to Week 24 all patients received secukinumab 150 or 300 mg, with non-responders eligible for dose escalation. The primary outcome was achieving an average spinal pain score below 4 (0–10 scale) at Week 8. Secukinumab showed significantly higher pain response and improvements in disease activity scores versus placebo, with sustained or further benefits up to Week 24 and no new safety signals."", ""detailedDescription"": ""SKIPPAIN (NCT03136861) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase IIIb, multicenter trial designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of secukinumab in adults with active axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), including both radiographic axSpA (ankylosing spondylitis) and non-radiographic axSpA. The trial specifically focused on spinal pain as the primary endpoint, reflecting a key treatment priority from the patient perspective.\n\nEligible patients were ≥18 years old, fulfilled Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) criteria for axSpA, and had active disease defined by a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) ≥4 and an average spinal pain score >4 on a 0–10 numerical rating scale (NRS). All had an inadequate response or intolerance to at least two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Prior exposure to a single TNF-α inhibitor was allowed following an appropriate washout. Key exclusions included prior treatment with other biologic immunomodulators (beyond one TNF inhibitor), other active inflammatory diseases, significant mechanical spinal disease, serious infections, malignancy within 5 years, and major uncontrolled comorbidities.\n\nThe study comprised two treatment periods. In Treatment Period 1 (TP1, baseline to Week 8), 380 patients were randomized 3:1 to receive secukinumab 150 mg or placebo, administered subcutaneously at baseline and Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 with blinding maintained via identical-appearing injections. The primary objective was to demonstrate superiority of secukinumab 150 mg over placebo in achieving an average spinal pain NRS score <4 at Week 8. Average spinal pain was calculated as the mean of total spinal pain (pain at any time) and nocturnal spinal pain (pain during the night), each self-reported on an 11-point NRS. The key secondary objective was superiority of secukinumab versus placebo in achieving BASDAI <4 at Week 8.\n\nAt Week 8, patients entered Treatment Period 2 (TP2, Week 8 to Week 24), during which all received active secukinumab 150 or 300 mg every 4 weeks (Weeks 8–20). Patients initially on secukinumab 150 mg who achieved average spinal pain <4 were classified as responders and reassigned to continue secukinumab 150 mg (Arm A1). Non-responders from the original secukinumab group were re-randomized to either continue 150 mg (Arm A2) or escalate to 300 mg (Arm A3) without loading. Patients originally on placebo were re-randomized 1:1 to secukinumab 150 mg (Arm B1) or 300 mg (Arm B2). This design allowed evaluation of both early pain response and a step-up dose optimization strategy in suboptimal responders.\n\nExploratory objectives included: (1) proportions of patients achieving spinal pain NRS <4 at Weeks 1–4 and Week 24; (2) BASDAI <4 at Week 24; (3) Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) <2.1 (low disease activity) and <1.3 (inactive disease) at Week 8 and Week 24; (4) changes in fatigue using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy–Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue); and (5) changes in overall health and functioning using the ASAS Health Index (ASAS-HI). Safety and tolerability of secukinumab 150 and 300 mg were characterized by adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and AEs of special interest (e.g., infections, inflammatory bowel disease, major adverse cardiovascular events) over both treatment periods and 12 weeks of follow-up.\n\nThe primary analysis used a logistic regression model including treatment, country, and prior TNF inhibitor exposure, applied to the full analysis set for TP1. At Week 8, 31.9% of secukinumab-treated versus 20.0% of placebo-treated patients achieved average spinal pain NRS <4, corresponding to an odds ratio of 1.89 (95% CI 1.08–3.33; p=0.0264). Secukinumab also improved nocturnal spinal pain, with a statistically significant odds ratio versus placebo, and showed numerically higher response for total spinal pain. The proportion of pain responders was higher with secukinumab as early as Week 1 and remained greater through Week 8.\n\nFor disease activity, 33.3% of secukinumab versus 23.2% of placebo patients achieved BASDAI <4 at Week 8 (OR 1.75; 95% CI 1.01–3.04; p=0.0466). Mean BASDAI and ASDAS scores decreased more with secukinumab than with placebo by Week 8. In TP2, all arms receiving secukinumab demonstrated further improvements in spinal pain and disease activity up to Week 24, with the greatest numerical gains in patients who were responders at Week 8 and continued on 150 mg (Arm A1). This arm also showed the highest proportions achieving ASDAS <2.1 and <1.3, and the largest improvements in FACIT-Fatigue and ASAS-HI, indicating better fatigue and overall health status.\n\nAmong Week 8 non-responders originally on 150 mg secukinumab, dose escalation to 300 mg (Arm A3) led to modestly higher numerical improvements in pain and disease activity compared with continuing 150 mg (Arm A2), particularly for high-hurdle endpoints such as ASDAS <2.1 and <1.3. However, these comparisons were exploratory, the study was not powered for direct dose comparisons, loading doses were not re-applied at up-titration, and Week 8 may have been too early to capture the full effect of 150 mg in some patients.\n\nSecukinumab exhibited a safety profile consistent with previous axSpA trials. Overall exposure in TP1 was about 4 weeks and in TP2 approximately 12 weeks. Across the entire 24-week treatment period, 2.4% of patients experienced serious AEs, 2.4% discontinued due to AEs, and no deaths occurred. Common AEs included headache, nasopharyngitis, oropharyngeal pain, and upper respiratory tract infection. Events of special interest, such as ulcerative colitis, major adverse cardiovascular events, neutropenia, and uveitis, were infrequent.\n\nOverall, the study demonstrates that secukinumab 150 mg provides rapid and clinically meaningful reductions in spinal pain and improvements in disease activity in patients with axial spondyloarthritis inadequately controlled by NSAIDs, with benefits sustained or enhanced through 24 weeks. The data suggest that a step-up strategy to 300 mg may be useful for suboptimal responders, though this requires confirmation in studies specifically powered for dose comparisons. The trial also underscores the importance and feasibility of using patient-reported spinal pain as a primary endpoint in axSpA clinical research.""}","{""conditions"": [""Axial Spondyloarthritis"", ""Spondyloarthritis, Ankylosing"", ""Ankylosing Spondylitis"", ""Non-Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis"", ""Back Pain"", ""Spinal Pain""], ""keywords"": [""Axial Spondyloarthritis"", ""Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis"", ""Non-Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis"", ""Ankylosing Spondylitis"", ""Spinal Pain"", ""Back Pain"", ""Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index"", ""BASDAI"", ""Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score"", ""ASDAS"", ""ASAS Health Index"", ""ASAS-HI"", ""FACIT-Fatigue"", ""Secukinumab"", ""Interleukin-17"", ""IL-17 Inhibitors"", ""Biologic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs"", ""bDMARDs"", ""Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors"", ""NSAID-Refractory Axial Spondyloarthritis"", ""Randomized Controlled Trial"", ""Dose Escalation"", ""Pain Management"", ""Nocturnal Pain"", ""Chronic Back Pain""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE3""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Randomized 3:1 to secukinumab 150 mg or placebo for an initial 8‑week double‑blind, placebo‑controlled period, followed by re-randomization/re-assignment at Week 8 into five secukinumab treatment arms (150 or 300 mg) through Week 24."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Treatment Period 1 (baseline to Week 8), with study drugs (active and placebo) identical in packaging, labelling, schedule of administration, and appearance; Treatment Period 2 (Week 8–24) used double-blind secukinumab treatment."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT"", ""CARE_PROVIDER"", ""INVESTIGATOR"", ""OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 380, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Group A – Secukinumab 150 mg (Treatment Period 1)"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Patients with active axial spondyloarthritis randomized 3:1 to receive secukinumab 150 mg during Treatment Period 1 (baseline to Week 8).

Sixty-six New York University Langone Health primary care and endocrinology clinics are randomized to receive either the BE-EHR module plus standard care or standard care alone for 18 months. The main outcome is patient-level adherence to Choosing Wisely–concordant glycemic control, with secondary outcomes describing how often the nudges fire and how clinicians interact with them."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This study evaluates the effectiveness of a behavioral economics–electronic health record (BE-EHR) intervention aimed at improving guideline-concordant diabetes care and reducing overtreatment in older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The trial targets patients aged 76 years or older with type 2 diabetes, who are receiving pharmacologic therapy and are seen within the New York University Langone Health (NYULH) system. The focus is on adherence to the American Geriatrics Society Choosing Wisely guideline that recommends less aggressive hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) targets and reduction in diabetes medications among older adults, tailored by life expectancy.\n\nDesign and Setting:\nA pragmatic, investigator-blind, cluster randomized controlled trial is conducted across 66 NYULH primary care and endocrinology clinics (including sites in the New York City area and two in Florida). Clinics, rather than individual patients, are randomized 1:1 to either (1) a 6-component BE-EHR module plus standard care or (2) standard care only. Eligible clinics must be active Epic users and have at least one prior patient encounter meeting the study’s patient-level eligibility criteria. Randomization is stratified by practice size (≤57 vs >57 eligible patients in 2019) and location (Manhattan/Brooklyn vs other locations) to balance clinic characteristics.\n\nParticipants:\nPatients are automatically included based on EHR data and a waiver of informed consent. Inclusion criteria are: age ≥76 years and a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes recorded on the EHR problem list or encounter diagnosis. Exclusion criteria include not taking any diabetes medication, allergy to metformin, or an estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m².\n\nIntervention:\nClinicians at intervention clinics receive a toolbox of six behavioral economics–based nudges integrated into the Epic EHR and email communications. These components are:\n1. **Tailored Advisory**: A noninterruptive alert within the EHR for patients who are noncompliant with Choosing Wisely glycemic targets, providing life-expectancy–tailored treatment recommendations. Clinicians can agree and indicate action taken, or document that recommendations are clinically inappropriate, with optional free-text justification. They can suppress the alert for that patient for about six months.\n2. **Refill Protocol**: An alert in the medication refill workflow for older adults on diabetes therapy, prompting clinicians to consider metformin as a first-line agent if not already used, or to consider dose reduction or discontinuation of metformin where appropriate. Comments are optional.\n3. **Preference List**: A system-level default ordering list that displays metformin at the top of the “First-line Type 2 Diabetes” medication list, without restricting access to other therapies.\n4. **Lab Result Nudge**: An alert in the lab results section when a new HbA1c value is available for a patient who is out of the Choosing Wisely–recommended range for their life expectancy category. The alert displays guideline-based ranges using prominent formatting and remains active for seven days after result posting.\n5. **Peer Comparison Email**: Monthly secure emails sent outside the EHR that compare each clinician’s Choosing Wisely compliance to their practice and to the overall NYULH system, presenting individualized, site-level, and system-level compliance graphics. The message text is framed positively or negatively depending on whether the clinician is above or below their practice average.\n6. **Campaign Materials**: Monthly game show–themed educational materials (e.g., animations modeled on The Price is Right, Jeopardy, and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, plus flashcards) sent outside the EHR to increase awareness of the Choosing Wisely guideline, with versions tailored by life expectancy category.\n\nAll components were developed using user-centered design methods, including interviews, design workshops, and in-clinic observations, and they draw on behavioral economics principles such as defaults, framing, social norming, peer comparison, suggestion of alternatives, affirmation, emotional appeal, accountable justification, gamification, and competition.\n\nLife Expectancy Algorithm and Glycemic Targets:\nTo operationalize the Choosing Wisely guideline, a life expectancy algorithm is implemented in the EHR, using age, gender, and a weighted count of chronic conditions with reference to Medicare-based life expectancy tables. Each patient is categorized into one of three life expectancy groups:\n- High life expectancy (>10 years): HbA1c target 7.0–7.5%\n- Medium life expectancy (3–10 years): HbA1c target 7.5–8.0%\n- Low life expectancy (≤3 years): HbA1c target 8.0–9.0%\n\nWithin each category, patients are classified as Choosing Wisely–compliant or noncompliant based on whether their measured HbA1c falls within the recommended range.\n\nOutcomes and Data Collection:\nThe primary outcome is patient-level Choosing Wisely compliance (binary), assessed longitudinally. Compliance is defined relative to life-expectancy–specific HbA1c ranges. Secondary outcomes include:\n- Frequency of activation of each BE-EHR nudge (e.g., tailored advisory firings, refill prompts, lab result alerts).\n- Measures of provider interaction with each component (e.g., alert acknowledgments, clicks, workflow patterns within Epic, free-text comments in accountable justification fields).\n- Email engagement metrics for the peer comparison and campaign nudges (e.g., read receipts).\n- Safety outcomes: rates of inpatient hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and deaths in intervention versus control arms.\n\nStatistical Analysis and Power:\nThe primary analysis uses a three-level logistic mixed-effects model with patient-level Choosing Wisely compliance as the dependent variable. Fixed effects include treatment group, time (4-week intervals), and their interaction. Random effects at the patient, provider, and practice levels account for clustering and repeated measures. Exploratory adjustment for covariates such as gender, age, life expectancy category, and number of visits (to assess dose-response to the intervention) will be considered.\n\nPower calculations, informed by a prior pilot study that showed a 5.1% increase in Choosing Wisely compliance and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.01, indicate that 66 practices (33 per arm), with an assumed average of 10 providers per site, provide approximately 93% power (two-sided α=0.05) to detect an effect size of 0.1 (about a 5 percentage point reduction in noncompliance). The trial is powered to evaluate the combined six-component module, not individual nudges, due to complexity and sample size limitations.\n\nImplementation and Timeline:\nAll six BE-EHR components were activated in the NYULH Epic EHR on December 7, 2020, and the intervention is planned to run for 18 months, with possible extension if clinic visit activity is substantially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The principal investigators remain blinded to group assignment; only the statistician, Epic data team, and clinicians receiving alerts (by necessity) are unblinded.\n\nThe study aims to provide evidence on whether a toolbox of behavioral economics–based nudges embedded in EHR and clinical decision support tools can promote appropriate deprescribing and less aggressive glycemic control in older adults with type 2 diabetes, and to generate detailed information on clinician workflows and interactions with digital nudges to inform optimization and future applications in other chronic disease contexts.""}","{""conditions"": [""Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus"", ""Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"", ""Hyperglycemia"", ""Overtreatment"", ""Deprescriptions"", ""Aged, 80 and over"", ""Aged""], ""keywords"": [""Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus"", ""Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"", ""Hyperglycemia"", ""Glycemic Control"", ""Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated"", ""Aged"", ""Aged, 80 and over"", ""Chronic Disease"", ""Deprescriptions"", ""Drug Therapy"", ""Primary Health Care"", ""Endocrinology"", ""Electronic Health Records"", ""Clinical Decision Support Systems"", ""Behavioral Economics"", ""Nudge Theory"", ""Choosing Wisely"", ""Practice Guidelines as Topic"", ""Pragmatic Clinical Trial"", ""Cluster Analysis"", ""Physician-Patient Relations"", ""Medication Overuse""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Pragmatic, investigator-blind, cluster randomized controlled trial in which 66 clinics are randomized 1:1 to receive either a 6-component BE-EHR module plus standard care or standard care only for 18 months."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""SINGLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Investigator-blind design: principal investigators and most of the study team are blinded to clinic assignment, while the study statistician, Epic data management team, clinicians receiving alerts, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board are unblinded."", ""whoMasked"": [""INVESTIGATOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": null, ""type"": null}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""BE-EHR module + standard care"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Clinicians at these 33 NYULH primary care and endocrinology clinics receive a 6-component Behavioral Economics–Electronic Health Record (BE-EHR) module in addition to usual care.

The study compared progression-free and overall survival between patients with and without detectable cfDNA BRAFV600E/K, and assessed the sensitivity and specificity of a digital droplet PCR assay against tumor tissue testing."", ""detailedDescription"": ""North Central Cancer Treatment Group (now Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology) N0879 was a randomized phase 2 trial in patients with unresectable stage IV melanoma. The trial compared a chemotherapy regimen of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab with or without everolimus. Importantly, no BRAF-targeted therapies were used, allowing evaluation of circulating biomarkers without confounding from BRAF inhibitors.\n\nThe objective of this analysis was to determine the prognostic value of detectable circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) harboring BRAFV600E/K mutations in this population. BRAFV600 mutations are present in 40%–60% of advanced melanomas and are central to the RAF–MEK–ERK signaling pathway. Standard practice uses archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue to determine BRAF mutation status, but tissue may be unavailable, mutation status can evolve over time, and heterogeneity between primary and metastatic sites can occur. cfDNA released from dying tumor cells offers a minimally invasive alternative for mutation detection and disease monitoring.\n\nThe study included 149 patients with histologically confirmed unresectable stage IV melanoma enrolled between May 5, 2010 and May 2, 2014, with one or fewer prior chemotherapy regimens. Key exclusions were prior taxane-based chemotherapy, prior anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy, brain metastases before enrollment, and significant comorbidities or other malignancies.\n\nArchived tumor tissue was analyzed using a clinical 50-gene hotspot next-generation sequencing panel (Illumina MiSeq) to detect somatic BRAFV600 mutations (exons 11 and 15, codons 594, 596, 600). Pretreatment plasma samples, collected at enrollment and stored at –80 °C, were used for cfDNA extraction. A clinically validated digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) assay (RainDrop/Bio-Rad platform) with TaqMan probes specific for wild-type BRAF and BRAFV600E/K mutations was applied to detect cfDNA BRAFV600E/K, reported qualitatively as “detected” or “not detected.” Laboratory personnel were blinded to clinical data.\n\nOf the 149 enrolled patients, plasma samples were available for 134, and both tumor tissue and plasma for 63. Among these 63, 20 (31.7%) had tumor tissue–confirmed BRAF V600E/K mutations and 43 were BRAF wild type. Of the 20 with tumor BRAF mutations, 11 (55.0%) had detectable cfDNA BRAFV600E/K. One of 43 patients with BRAF wild-type tissue had detectable cfDNA BRAFV600E/K. Using tissue as the reference, the cfDNA assay had a sensitivity of 55%, specificity of 97.7%, positive predictive value of 91.7%, and negative predictive value of 82.4%.\n\nTime-to-event outcomes (progression-free survival [PFS] and overall survival [OS]) were analyzed using Kaplan–Meier estimates, pooling both treatment arms because the parent trial showed no difference between regimens. Among patients with BRAF-mutant tumors, those with detectable cfDNA BRAFV600E/K had shorter PFS (median 5.8 vs 12.0 months; P = .051) and OS (median 9.2 vs 27.1 months; P = .054) than those without detectable cfDNA mutation, suggesting that the presence of cfDNA BRAFV600E/K is associated with worse prognosis. Patients without detectable BRAF mutations in either tissue or blood had superior outcomes compared with patients with both tissue BRAF mutation and positive cfDNA. In multivariate analysis, elevated baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was strongly associated with shorter PFS and OS, and male sex with shorter OS, although the analysis was underpowered.\n\nThe study concludes that in advanced melanoma, approximately half of patients with BRAF-mutant tumors have detectable cfDNA BRAFV600E/K, and that detectable cfDNA BRAFV600E/K is associated with poorer survival outcomes in a setting without BRAF-targeted therapy. The cfDNA assay showed high specificity but modest sensitivity relative to tissue testing, reflecting the low fraction of tumor-derived DNA in circulation, especially in patients with low tumor burden. The findings support the use of cfDNA BRAFV600E/K as a minimally invasive prognostic biomarker and a potential tool for risk stratification and patient selection in future melanoma clinical trials. Further research in larger cohorts and in the context of modern targeted and immunotherapies is recommended to refine its prognostic, predictive, and diagnostic roles.""}","{""conditions"": [""Melanoma"", ""Stage IV Melanoma"", ""Metastatic Melanoma"", ""Skin Neoplasms"", ""BRAF V600E Mutation-Positive Melanoma"", ""BRAF V600K Mutation-Positive Melanoma""], ""keywords"": [""Melanoma"", ""Advanced Melanoma"", ""Metastatic Melanoma"", ""Stage IV Melanoma"", ""Unresectable Melanoma"", ""Skin Neoplasms"", ""BRAF V600E"", ""BRAF V600K"", ""BRAF Mutations"", ""Cell-Free DNA"", ""Circulating Tumor DNA"", ""cfDNA"", ""Digital Droplet PCR"", ""ddPCR"", ""Prognosis"", ""Progression-Free Survival"", ""Overall Survival"", ""Carboplatin"", ""Paclitaxel"", ""Bevacizumab"", ""Everolimus""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Randomized phase 2 trial of two parallel arms comparing carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab with or without everolimus in patients with unresectable stage IV melanoma."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""No masking described;

Twenty-eight adults with measurable ENKTL received sintilimab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 24 months. The main goal was to see how many patients had tumor shrinkage (objective response rate) using Lugano 2014 criteria. Sintilimab achieved a high response rate with durable overall survival and a mostly mild to moderate side-effect profile, suggesting it may be an effective and tolerable treatment option for this difficult-to-treat lymphoma."", ""detailedDescription"": ""ORIENT-4 is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 clinical trial conducted at six hospitals in China to assess sintilimab, a recombinant humanized anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody, in patients with relapsed or refractory extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (r/r ENKTL). ENKTL is an aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by frequent Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) association, poor response to conventional anthracycline-based chemotherapy, and limited options after failure of asparaginase-based regimens, where median survival is typically less than 6 months.\n\nKey eligibility criteria included age 18–70 years, histologically confirmed ENKTL with at least one measurable lesion (>15 mm or positive 18F-FDG PET uptake), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0–2, adequate organ and bone marrow function, prior receipt of at least one asparaginase-based chemotherapy regimen (with local radiotherapy for stage I/II disease), and relapse or refractoriness to previous treatment. Exclusion criteria included aggressive NK-cell leukemia, primary or secondary central nervous system lymphoma, severe hemophagocytic syndrome at initial diagnosis, and prior exposure to checkpoint inhibitors.\n\nPatients received sintilimab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until disease progression, death, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or completion of 24 months of therapy. Treatment beyond radiologic progression was permitted when investigators suspected pseudo-progression based on imaging, laboratory markers, and clinical status. Tumor assessments used 18F-FDG PET at baseline and weeks 6, 15, and 24, and contrast-enhanced CT at baseline, weeks 24, 36, 48, and every 24 weeks thereafter, with responses evaluated according to Lugano 2014 criteria. The best overall response was defined as the best response from treatment start to progression or relapse.\n\nThe primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR = complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) to sintilimab monotherapy. Secondary endpoints included CR and PR rates, disease control rate (DCR = CR + PR + stable disease), time to response (TTR), duration of response (DOR), overall survival (OS) at 1 and 2 years, safety, and health-related quality of life measured using EQ-5D-5L and EORTC QLQ-C30. Safety was graded by CTCAE v4.03. Anti-drug antibody (ADA) and neutralizing antibody (NAb) sampling was performed longitudinally.\n\nFrom August 31, 2017 to February 7, 2018, 34 patients were screened and 28 enrolled; all had failed asparaginase-based treatment. The median age was 37 years; most patients had advanced disease (67.9% stage IV), ECOG PS 1–2 (89.3%), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (64.3%), and a median of 3 prior lines of chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 30.4 months, the ORR was 75.0% (21/28; 95% CI 55.1–89.3%), incorporating 5 patients with initial apparent progression later deemed pseudo-progression. CR and PR rates were 21.4% and 53.6%, respectively, and the DCR was 85.7% (95% CI 67.3–96.0%). Median TTR was 1.3 months (95% CI 1.3–3.4), and median DOR was 4.1 months (95% CI 2.1–15.2). Subgroup analyses suggested higher ORR in patients with normal lactate dehydrogenase and without bone marrow involvement.\n\nSeven deaths occurred by data cut-off. The 1-year OS rate was 82.1% (95% CI 62.3–92.1%) and the 2-year OS rate was 78.6% (95% CI 58.4–89.8%), with median OS not reached. Pseudo-progression and fluctuating radiologic responses, such as transient new lesions or increased FDG uptake followed by regression, were observed in a notable subset of patients and were not associated with inferior survival, highlighting the need for cautious interpretation of early imaging under PD-1 blockade and potentially extended response assessment windows beyond the conventional 4–6 months.\n\nSafety analyses showed that 96.4% of patients experienced at least one treatment-related adverse event (TRAE), most of which were grade 1–2. The most frequent TRAEs included decreased lymphocyte count, pyrexia, and decreased white blood cell count. Only one grade 4 TRAE (diabetes) was reported, and no grade 5 TRAEs occurred. Serious adverse events were seen in 25.0% of patients, with only ketoacidosis considered related to sintilimab. Two TRAEs (diabetes and thrombocytopenia) led to treatment discontinuation. No positive ADA or infusion-related reactions were detected. Overall, the safety profile compared favorably with conventional chemotherapy regimens used in ENKTL.\n\nQuality-of-life scores improved during therapy, with significant gains in EQ-5D-5L index, EQ-5D-5L visual analog scale, and EORTC QLQ-C30 scores starting around weeks 15–24 and maintained through extended follow-up.\n\nA retrospective historical control cohort of 46 patients with r/r ENKTL who failed asparaginase-based regimens showed an ORR of 32.8% and median OS of 4.8 months, underscoring the poor prognosis with conventional salvage therapies. Compared with these data and other reported regimens, sintilimab monotherapy demonstrated a higher response rate and encouraging long-term survival.\n\nThe study was designed to test the hypothesis that sintilimab could achieve an ORR greater than 30% in r/r ENKTL; with the lower bound of the 95% CI for ORR exceeding 30%, this hypothesis was met despite early termination of enrollment at 28 patients. Limitations include the single-arm design, reliance on investigator-based response assessment using Lugano 2014 criteria (which may not optimally capture immune-related response patterns), incomplete planned sample size, and heterogeneous post-trial treatments. Nonetheless, ORIENT-4 provides prospective evidence that sintilimab is active and generally well tolerated in r/r ENKTL, supporting further evaluation of sintilimab-based regimens, including combination approaches, in this population.""}","{""conditions"": [""Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type"", ""Relapsed extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma"", ""Refractory extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma"", ""Non-Hodgkin lymphoma"", ""Peripheral T-cell lymphoma""], ""keywords"": [""Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma"", ""ENKTL"", ""NKTCL"", ""Nasal-type lymphoma"", ""Non-Hodgkin lymphoma"", ""Peripheral T-cell lymphoma"", ""Relapsed lymphoma"", ""Refractory lymphoma"", ""PD-1 inhibitor"", ""Programmed cell death 1 receptor"", ""Sintilimab"", ""Immune checkpoint inhibitors"", ""Epstein-Barr Virus"", ""EBV-associated lymphoma"", ""Asparaginase-based chemotherapy"", ""Gemcitabine"", ""Avelumab"", ""Pembrolizumab"", ""Nivolumab"", ""Overall survival"", ""Objective response rate"", ""Lugano 2014 criteria"", ""Positron-Emission Tomography"", ""FDG-PET"", ""Pseudo-progression"", ""Phase II clinical trial"", ""Single-arm study"", ""Salvage therapy""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""NA"", ""interventionModel"": ""SINGLE_GROUP"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Multicenter, single-arm phase 2 trial in which all enrolled patients received sintilimab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 24 months."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": ""OTHER"", ""timePerspective"": ""PROSPECTIVE"", ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Open-label single-arm trial with no blinding; investigators assessed outcomes."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 28, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Sintilimab Monotherapy"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Single-arm, phase 2 study in which patients with relapsed/refractory extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma who had failed at least one prior asparaginase-based regimen received sintilimab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 24 months.

The AHCL system consists of a MiniMed 670G insulin pump running a next-generation version 4.0 algorithm (MiniMed 780G-type) integrated with the Guardian Sensor 3 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system and Guardian Link 3 transmitter. The algorithm provides automated basal insulin delivery (Auto Basal), automated correction boluses (Auto Correction) up to every 5 minutes, predictive low glucose management features, and a meal detection module that can intensify correction boluses when a meal is suspected. Users can choose a glucose target of 100 mg/dL or 120 mg/dL and may temporarily set a target of 150 mg/dL.\n\nThe study employed a multicenter, open-label, single-arm design. Eligible participants had type 1 diabetes for at least 2 years, used insulin pump therapy for more than 6 months, required at least 8 units of insulin per day, and had screening hemoglobin A1C <10%. Exclusion criteria included recent severe hypoglycemia requiring assistance, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), recent hospitalization for uncontrolled diabetes, hypoglycemia unawareness, and significant skin issues preventing sensor use.\n\nParticipants completed a baseline run-in period of approximately 14 days using the AHCL hardware as a sensor-augmented pump (SAP) with or without predictive low glucose management (PLGM) or with Auto Basal only; automated correction bolus (Auto Correction) was generally disabled during this phase. This run-in served as the comparator for subsequent closed-loop outcomes. Following run-in, participants entered a study phase of approximately 90 days in which both Auto Basal and Auto Correction were enabled. Each participant used one programmed glucose target (100 or 120 mg/dL) for about 45 ± 5 days, then switched to the alternate target for the remaining 45 ± 5 days, allowing within-subject comparison of different target settings. Active insulin time (AIT) settings were clinician- and user-selected and examined post hoc for their association with glycemic outcomes.\n\nThe intent-to-treat cohort included 157 participants (39 adolescents and 118 adults); 152 completed the full study phase. The primary efficacy endpoints were exploratory and included change in mean time in range (TIR, 70–180 mg/dL) and mean hemoglobin A1C from the end of run-in to the end of the study phase. Additional glycemic endpoints included mean sensor glucose (SG), coefficient of variation (CV) of SG, time below range (TBR) at thresholds <70, <54, and <50 mg/dL, time above range (TAR) at thresholds >180, >250, and >300 mg/dL, and day (6 AM–12 AM) vs night (12 AM–6 AM) metrics. Insulin delivery endpoints included total daily insulin dose, basal (including microboluses), user-initiated boluses, and automated correction boluses in absolute units and as a proportion of total bolus insulin. Safety endpoints included serious adverse events (SAEs), serious adverse device effects (SADEs), unanticipated adverse device effects, severe hypoglycemia, and DKA.\n\nAnalyses were performed primarily in the intent-to-treat population, with a per-protocol sensitivity analysis yielding similar results. Within-participant comparisons between run-in and study phase used Wilcoxon signed-rank tests or paired t-tests, and associations between AIT and glycemic metrics used Spearman correlations.\n\nDuring the study phase, participants spent on average about 95% of time in closed-loop mode, with roughly 1.2 exits per week. Compared with run-in therapy (SAP/PLGM/Auto Basal without Auto Correction), use of full AHCL (Auto Basal + Auto Correction) reduced mean A1C from 7.5% to 7.0%, increased 24-hour TIR from 68.8% to 74.5%, and reduced TBR (<70 mg/dL) from 3.3% to 2.3%, without severe hypoglycemia or DKA. Improvements were observed in both adolescents and adults and were more pronounced overnight, where TIR exceeded 80% and both TBR and TAR decreased. The fraction of participants achieving an A1C <7% and TIR >70% increased substantially, and a larger proportion met international consensus CGM targets for TIR and limited hypoglycemia (TBR <70 mg/dL <4% and TBR <54 mg/dL <1%).\n\nSubgroup analyses showed that setting the glucose target to 100 mg/dL yielded higher TIR than 120 mg/dL, and more aggressive AIT settings (as short as 2 hours) at the 100 mg/dL target further improved TIR without a meaningful increase in TBR. Automated correction boluses accounted for about 20–22% of total bolus insulin over the full day and more than 60% of bolus insulin overnight, indicating that the algorithm assumed a substantial part of corrective dosing burden, especially during sleep. Total insulin and total bolus doses increased modestly from run-in to the study phase, particularly in adolescents, while basal insulin decreased somewhat in adults over the full day and daytime.\n\nAcross more than 20,000 device days in the entire study and more than 14,000 days with Auto Basal and Auto Correction enabled, the safety profile was favorable: no device-related SAEs, no SADEs or unanticipated device effects, and no DKA. One severe hypoglycemia event occurred during the run-in period (before full AHCL use) and was not attributed to the investigational device. The AHCL system performance and safety were consistent with, and extended, prior smaller randomized controlled trials and cross-over studies of this algorithm in camp, supervised, and at-home settings.\n\nOverall, the study demonstrates that the MiniMed AHCL system is safe and effective for improving glycemic control in adolescents and adults with type 1 diabetes who are already experienced pump users, enabling more users to attain international CGM-based targets for time in range and hypoglycemia. The findings suggest that appropriate selection of glucose target and active insulin time settings can further optimize glycemic outcomes and may reduce day-to-day management burden by shifting more corrective dosing to the automated system.""}","{""conditions"": [""Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus""], ""keywords"": [""Type 1 Diabetes"", ""Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1"", ""Advanced Hybrid Closed-Loop"", ""Hybrid Closed-Loop"", ""Automated Insulin Delivery"", ""Insulin Infusion Systems"", ""Insulin Pump"", ""Continuous Glucose Monitoring"", ""Sensor-Augmented Pump"", ""Predictive Low Glucose Management"", ""Glycemic Control"", ""Hemoglobin A1c"", ""Time in Range"", ""Time Below Range"", ""Time Above Range"", ""Adolescent"", ""Adult""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""NON_RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""SINGLE_GROUP"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Multicenter open-label single-arm study in which all enrolled adolescents and adults with type 1 diabetes used the same advanced hybrid closed-loop MiniMed AHCL system through a run-in period followed by a ~90-day study phase."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": ""COHORT"", ""timePerspective"": ""PROSPECTIVE"", ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Open-label study with no blinding; participants and investigators were aware of treatment."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 157, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Advanced Hybrid Closed-Loop (AHCL) System"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Single-arm, open-label study in adolescents (14–21 years) and adults (22–75 years) with type 1 diabetes using the MiniMed advanced hybrid closed-loop (AHCL) insulin delivery system.

Eight healthy volunteers received artemether-lumefantrine plus either ruxolitinib or placebo for 3 days. The study assessed safety, tolerability, blood levels (pharmacokinetics) of all drugs, and the biological activity of ruxolitinib by measuring inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation (pSTAT3) in blood cells. The combination was well tolerated, with only mild adverse events and no serious safety signals. Coadministration did not meaningfully change exposure to artemether, its metabolite dihydroartemisinin, or lumefantrine, and ruxolitinib produced about threefold greater pSTAT3 inhibition than placebo with a direct relationship between ruxolitinib blood levels and pSTAT3 inhibition. These results support further studies of ruxolitinib added to artemether-lumefantrine in controlled Plasmodium falciparum infection models."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This was a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center phase 1 trial conducted in healthy male and female volunteers aged 18 to 55 years in Brisbane, Australia. The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of combining the approved artemisinin-based antimalarial regimen artemether-lumefantrine with the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of artemether, its major active metabolite dihydroartemisinin, lumefantrine, and ruxolitinib when coadministered, and to characterize the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of ruxolitinib through inhibition of IL‑6–induced phosphorylation of STAT3 (pSTAT3) in white blood cells.\n\nThe immunologic rationale is based on evidence that type I interferons and downstream JAK–STAT signaling contribute to parasite-induced immune dysregulation in Plasmodium falciparum infection, including expansion of regulatory Tr1 cells and impaired antiparasitic CD4+ T‑cell responses. Ruxolitinib, an oral JAK1/2 inhibitor approved for myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease, can block type I IFN signaling and reduce pSTAT3, thereby potentially restoring more effective antiparasitic immunity when given with standard antimalarial therapy.\n\nEight healthy participants were enrolled and randomized: six to artemether-lumefantrine plus ruxolitinib 20 mg twice daily and two to artemether-lumefantrine plus placebo twice daily for 3 days. Artemether-lumefantrine was administered at the standard adult dose for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria (four 20/120 mg tablets per dose, six doses over 3 days, total 480/2880 mg), each dose taken with full-fat milk. Ruxolitinib or matching placebo was administered orally 2 hours after each artemether-lumefantrine dose (total ruxolitinib dose 120 mg). The 2‑hour separation was chosen to minimize any potential inhibition of intestinal CYP3A4 by ruxolitinib, as artemether and lumefantrine are CYP3A4 substrates.\n\nParticipants were intensively monitored during in-clinic confinement (day −1 through day 4) and at outpatient follow‑up visits through day 29. Safety assessments included adverse event recording (MedDRA terms, CTCAE v5.0 grading), vital signs, 12‑lead ECGs with QTcF evaluation, clinical laboratory testing (hematology, chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis), physical examinations, and concomitant medication review.\n\nFor PK assessment, serial blood samples were collected over 72 hours after the first artemether-lumefantrine dose and at later time points up to 672 hours. Plasma concentrations of artemether, dihydroartemisinin, lumefantrine, and ruxolitinib were quantified by validated LC–MS/MS assays. Noncompartmental PK analysis generated parameters such as Cmax, Tmax, AUC over various intervals, and apparent half-life where feasible.\n\nEx vivo PD assessment of JAK–STAT pathway inhibition used IL‑6 stimulation of whole blood followed by measurement of pSTAT3 and total STAT3 in white blood cells. Percent pSTAT3 inhibition was calculated relative to baseline (average of three pre‑dose time points). Area under the effect–time curve over the dosing interval (AUECT) was used to summarize PD effects. The relationship between ruxolitinib plasma concentration and %pSTAT3 inhibition was characterized using a direct effect sigmoid Emax model within a PK/PD modeling framework. One‑compartment PK with first-order absorption and elimination, and a sigmoidal Emax effect model without delay, best described the data, indicating minimal hysteresis between concentration and effect.\n\nSix of eight participants experienced treatment-emergent adverse events, all mild. One participant in the ruxolitinib group had a headache considered related to study drugs; in the placebo group, headache and a maculopapular rash (onset 12 days after first dosing, resolving within 3 days with topical corticosteroids) were considered drug-related. There were no serious adverse events, no discontinuations due to adverse events, and no deaths. No clinically relevant trends were noted in vital signs, laboratory parameters, or ECGs; two ruxolitinib recipients had QTcF prolongations >30 ms, but no QTcF exceeded 450 ms.\n\nIn the small placebo group, artemether was rapidly absorbed (median Tmax ~2.4 h) with declining concentrations thereafter; dihydroartemisinin showed a similar pattern. Lumefantrine exposure (AUC) and elimination half-life (~200 h) were consistent with known profiles. In the ruxolitinib group, overall exposure to artemether, dihydroartemisinin and lumefantrine was broadly similar to placebo. Artemether Cmax decreased by day 3 compared to day 1 in both groups, but on day 3 it was statistically lower in the ruxolitinib group than in the placebo group in a post hoc analysis. Ruxolitinib itself was rapidly absorbed (median Tmax ~1.5 h), with an estimated half-life of about 2.5 h from PK/PD modeling. Apparent lower ruxolitinib exposure on day 3 vs day 1 was observed, though comparisons are limited by different sampling schedules.\n\nRuxolitinib coadministration produced marked inhibition of pSTAT3 compared with placebo. The geometric mean AUECT for %pSTAT3 inhibition was 544 ng·h/ml in the ruxolitinib group and 181 ng·h/ml in the placebo group, yielding a geometric mean ratio of 3.01 (90% CI 2.14–4.24), i.e., approximately threefold greater inhibition with ruxolitinib plus artemether-lumefantrine. PK/PD modeling confirmed a direct and predictable relationship between ruxolitinib plasma concentrations and %pSTAT3 inhibition without appreciable temporal delay.\n\nThe authors conclude that ruxolitinib administered 2 hours after artemether-lumefantrine is well tolerated in healthy volunteers and does not appear to substantially alter the PK of artemether, dihydroartemisinin, or lumefantrine in this small exploratory study. The observed robust pSTAT3 inhibition supports further evaluation of ruxolitinib as a host-directed adjunct to artemether-lumefantrine in controlled human Plasmodium falciparum infection studies, with the long-term goal of enhancing protective antiparasitic immunity and potentially reducing malaria reinfection or severe disease.

Thirty-seven participants with ASD and IQ ≥ 70, along with their social coaches (mainly parents), were randomized to an immediate treatment group or a delayed treatment (waitlist) group. The intervention consisted of 16 weekly 90‑minute group sessions for young adults and parallel sessions for social coaches. The study examined whether PEERS®-YA-K improved social skills knowledge, observable social functioning, adaptive behavior, and reduced depression and anxiety, and whether gains were maintained at 4‑month follow‑up."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This study investigated the effectiveness and cultural feasibility of the Korean version of the Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills for Young Adults (PEERS®-YA-K) for young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Because social difficulties, including challenges in friendships and romantic relationships, often persist into adulthood for individuals with ASD, and evidence-based interventions for this age group are scarce, the authors aimed to translate and culturally adapt the original American PEERS®-YA curriculum and then test it in a randomized controlled trial (RCT).\n\nThe intervention manual was first translated into Korean by PEERS®-certified providers and reviewed by autism specialists. To ensure cultural and ecological validity, the team conducted intensive interviews with 29 typically developing Korean young adults to gather detailed information about dating etiquette, common social activities, peer groups, and strategies for handling bullying in Korea. Based on these interviews, specific rules and examples, especially those related to dating and social activities, were modified, while preserving the original structure and core treatment principles.\n\nThe PEERS®-YA-K program consists of 16 weekly 90‑minute group sessions delivered concurrently to young adults and their social coaches (primarily mothers, but also fathers and one mentor) in separate groups. Didactic lessons and behavioral rehearsal target conversational skills, electronic communication, developing friendship networks, using humor appropriately, entering and exiting peer groups, organizing get-togethers, handling teasing and bullying, managing peer pressure and conflict, as well as skills specific to dating such as showing romantic interest, asking someone on a date, going on dates, and following general dating guidelines. Social coaches are trained in the same content to support practice and generalization at home and in the community. Treatment fidelity was high (average 0.95).\n\nParticipants were recruited from a university hospital clinic and community ASD-related organizations. Inclusion criteria included age 18–35 years, high school graduate or about to graduate, clinically recognized social difficulties, a confirmed or suspected ASD diagnosis, verbal fluency, full-scale IQ ≥ 70 (K-WAIS-IV), and motivation to participate. Exclusion criteria included major mental illness (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, psychosis, acute self-harm risk), significant sensory or physical disabilities, serious neurological or medical conditions limiting group participation, and inability of the social coach to engage in the program. ASD diagnosis was confirmed by board-certified child psychiatrists using DSM‑5 criteria supported by ADOS‑2 and ADI‑R.\n\nThirty-seven young adults with ASD and their social coaches were randomized via block randomization to an immediate treatment group (TG; n=19) or a delayed treatment group (DTG; n=18; waitlist control). Formal social skills group training and new therapies were prohibited for DTG during the waiting period; however, usual care (e.g., individual counseling, follow-up visits, pharmacotherapy) was allowed. Ultimately, 31 participants (TG=17, DTG=14) completed the 16‑week intervention; the overall completion rate was 83.78%. The sample was predominantly male (only one female), with mean age around 23.4 years and average IQ around 100. Most were students or unemployed, and the majority of social coaches were mothers.\n\nOutcome assessments were conducted at multiple time points. The TG and DTG both completed measures at baseline and immediately post-intervention; the DTG also completed an additional pre-treatment assessment at the end of their waitlist period; both groups completed a 4‑month post-treatment follow‑up. Primary outcomes addressed ASD-related social difficulties and included: ADOS‑2 Module 4 (clinician-observed social communication and restricted/repetitive behaviors), the Test of Young Adult Social Skills Knowledge (TYASSK), the Korean Social Skills Rating System (K-SSRS; self and parent report), and the Social Responsiveness Scale‑2 (SRS‑2; self and caregiver report). Secondary outcomes included adaptive functioning (communication, daily living skills, socialization) measured by the Korean Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (K‑VABS) and depressive symptoms measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Exploratory measures included the Quality of Socialization Questionnaire (QSQ; frequency of get-togethers and dates), the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), and anxiety measures (Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI] and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI-S, STAI-T]).\n\nStatistical analyses included baseline comparisons, repeated measures ANOVA with treatment (TG vs DTG) by time interactions, and paired t‑tests for within-group pre/post and follow‑up comparisons. Several models progressively controlled for age, IQ, medication use, and homework completion rate as covariates. Effect sizes were estimated using Cohen’s d.\n\nBetween-group analyses showed a significant treatment-by-time effect favoring the PEERS®-YA-K group for social skills knowledge as measured by the TYASSK, indicating that the intervention effectively improved understanding of targeted social skills beyond changes observed in the waitlist group. Covariates such as age, IQ, medication, and homework completion were associated with some outcomes, but the primary consistent effect was on social knowledge.\n\nIn within-group analyses pooling all participants who eventually received PEERS®-YA-K, significant improvements were observed from pre- to post-treatment in TYASSK scores and self-rated social skills (K‑SSRS), as well as in parent-rated adaptive communication (K‑VABS). Although immediate post-treatment changes were limited on some functional social behavior measures and mood/anxiety scales, several domains showed significant improvement at the 4‑month follow‑up. These longer-term gains included maintained improvements in social skills knowledge (TYASSK), better parent-rated social responsiveness (SRS‑2), enhanced ADOS‑2 social interaction scores, improved communication and daily living skills on the K‑VABS, and reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms (BAI, BDI).\n\nHomework completion, which indexed participant engagement in practicing skills between sessions, was around 50% on average. Participants with higher homework completion rates showed broader and larger improvements, including greater gains in social skills knowledge (TYASSK), socialization (K‑VABS), and social skills (K‑SSRS), as well as anxiety reduction, underscoring the importance of real-life practice and caregiver-supported generalization.\n\nOverall, the study suggests that a modestly culturally adapted PEERS®-YA program is feasible and acceptable for Korean young adults with high-functioning ASD, achieving high attendance, strong treatment fidelity, and good satisfaction. The intervention reliably improved social skills knowledge and, over time, was associated with improvements in observed social interaction, adaptive functioning, and emotional symptoms. However, immediate, robust changes in functional social behavior (e.g., frequency of get-togethers and dates) were less evident than in some previous US trials. The authors discuss potential reasons, including cultural context (stigma towards ASD, limited social opportunities for young adults, heavy academic/work demands) and limitations of available outcome measures for real-world social functioning in Korean adults with ASD. They note that while increased social skills knowledge was clearly demonstrated, translation into real-world functional gains may depend on individual factors, environmental opportunities, and sustained practice.\n\nLimitations include reliance on self- and parent-report measures, the use of ADOS‑2 as a primary observational outcome despite its design as a diagnostic tool, lack of blinded third-party raters, small sample size, medication heterogeneity, and the waitlist (rather than active control) design. The authors conclude that PEERS®-YA-K is a promising, culturally adapted, evidence-based social skills intervention for Korean young adults with ASD and highlight the need for further research on predictors of functional change and the interplay between social skills, anxiety, and depression.""}","{""conditions"": [""Autism Spectrum Disorder"", ""Asperger Syndrome"", ""Pervasive Developmental Disorder"", ""Social Skills Deficits"", ""Social Communication Disorder"", ""Depressive Disorder"", ""Anxiety Disorders""], ""keywords"": [""Autism Spectrum Disorder"", ""ASD"", ""High-Functioning Autism"", ""Young Adult"", ""Social Skills Training"", ""Social Skills"", ""Social Communication"", ""Social Functioning"", ""Interpersonal Relations"", ""Friendship"", ""Dating Behavior"", ""Romantic Relationships"", ""Group Therapy"", ""Cognitive Behavioral Therapy"", ""PEERS"", ""PEERS for Young Adults"", ""PEERS-YA"", ""PEERS-YA-K"", ""Cultural Adaptation"", ""Cross-Cultural Comparison"", ""Korea"", ""Randomized Controlled Trial"", ""Waitlist Control"", ""Adaptive Behavior"", ""Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales"", ""ADOS-2"", ""Social Responsiveness Scale"", ""Depression"", ""Anxiety""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Randomized controlled trial with participants assigned either to an immediate treatment group or a delayed treatment (waitlist) group, each receiving the PEERS-YA-K intervention in parallel at different time points."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Open-label waitlist-controlled RCT; participants and intervention providers were aware of group assignment.

Twenty‑three participants aged 13–22 years with molecularly confirmed FMR1 full mutation and moderate‑to‑severe neurobehavioral impairment received OV101 5 mg once, twice, or three times daily. The main goal was to determine whether OV101 is safe and well tolerated, and secondarily to explore its impact on core behavioral problems such as irritability, anxiety, social withdrawal, hyperactivity, and other maladaptive behaviors commonly seen in FXS. OV101 was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events, and clinician‑ and caregiver‑rated measures showed an initial signal of improvement in several behavioral domains, supporting further evaluation in larger, placebo‑controlled trials."", ""detailedDescription"": ""Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, resulting from a full‑mutation expansion (>200 CGG repeats) in the 5′ untranslated region of the FMR1 gene, leading to epigenetic silencing and deficiency or absence of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Individuals with FXS typically show a broad spectrum of neurobehavioral abnormalities including cognitive and language impairment, anxiety, social withdrawal, hyperarousal, sensory processing difficulties, repetitive behaviors, attention deficits, irritability, aggression, and self‑injury. Evidence from Fmr1 knockout mouse models indicates reduced expression of the GABAA receptor δ subunit, decreased GABA synthesis and levels, and impaired tonic inhibition, suggesting that GABAergic dysfunction contributes to the pathophysiology of FXS and may be a therapeutic target.\n\nGaboxadol (OV101) is a δ‑subunit–selective, extrasynaptic GABAA receptor agonist that enhances tonic inhibition. In Fmr1 knockout mice, OV101 restored tonic inhibition in the amygdala, reduced sensory hypersensitivity and motor hyperactivity, and improved repetitive, social, and anxiety‑like behaviors. OV101 has also been previously studied in adults with insomnia, where it was generally well tolerated and improved sleep induction. Based on these preclinical and clinical data, this first interventional FXS trial was designed as a proof‑of‑concept to assess the safety, tolerability, and optimal daily dose of OV101, and to explore its effects on core behavioral symptoms in adolescent and adult males with FXS.\n\nThis multicenter, randomized (1:1:1), double‑blind, parallel‑group phase 2a trial (NCT03697161) was conducted at seven sites in the United States and one site in Israel. Male participants aged 13–22 years with clinically and molecularly confirmed FMR1 full mutation, Clinical Global Impressions–Severity (CGI‑S) score ≥4 (moderate‑to‑severe illness), and Full Scale IQ <75 were eligible. To focus on individuals with minimal FMRP expression, females were excluded. Participants with uncontrolled seizures, recent seizure episodes or changes in anticonvulsant therapy, regular use of GABAergic agents or cannabinoid derivatives, significant suicidal history, or clinically significant comorbid medical conditions were excluded. Concomitant antiepileptic or psychoactive medications (up to three) were allowed if doses were stable for at least four weeks prior to randomization and maintained throughout the study.\n\nParticipants were randomized to receive OV101 5 mg once daily (QD), twice daily (BID), or three times daily (TID) for 12 weeks. All participants took study medication three times per day (morning, afternoon, evening); OV101 was always given in the morning, and matching OV101 or placebo capsules were given in the afternoon and evening to preserve blinding across regimens. Dose adjustments were not permitted. Clinic visits occurred at weeks 2, 6, and 12 (end of treatment), with a follow‑up end‑of‑study visit between weeks 16 and 18. Adverse events, concomitant medications, and suicidality were also monitored via scheduled phone calls. Caregivers or legally authorized representatives (LARs) kept sleep diaries, and participants wore actigraphs for seven‑day intervals around key visits.\n\nThe primary objective was to evaluate safety and tolerability of OV101 over 12 weeks. Key safety endpoints included treatment‑emergent adverse events (TEAEs), treatment‑related AEs, TEAEs leading to study discontinuation, and serious adverse events (SAEs). Treatment compliance was assessed from caregiver medication diaries, with ≥80% considered compliant. The secondary objective was to explore the effect of OV101 on behavioral and emotional outcomes using a battery of clinician‑ and caregiver‑rated instruments. Clinician‑rated measures included CGI‑Improvement (CGI‑I) and CGI‑Severity (CGI‑S), including subdomains (communication and connectedness, anxiety, ADHD, and Vineland‑3 activities of daily living [ADLs]). Caregiver‑rated measures included the Aberrant Behavior Checklist–Community (ABC‑C) and its FXS‑specific factor scoring (ABC‑CFXS), the Anxiety, Depression, and Mood Scale (ADAMS), the Repetitive Behavior Scale–Revised (RBS‑R), the Short Sensory Profile‑2, and the Conners 3 scales. Exploratory endpoints included Parent Global Impressions–Severity (PGI‑S), Parent Global Impressions–Improvement (PGI‑I), and clinician‑rated visual analog scale (VAS) scores for the top three caregiver‑identified concerns (e.g., anxiety, disruptive behavior, ADLs).\n\nDescriptive statistics were used for primary safety and secondary efficacy outcomes. Mixed‑effects models for repeated measures (MMRM) were applied to explore trends over time and potential effects of dose regimen and age group, with fixed effects for dosing regimen, visit, age group, and interaction terms, and baseline values as covariates where appropriate. Post‑hoc analyses of change or percent change from baseline for selected scales (CGI‑S, ABC‑CFXS, ADAMS) were performed using Student’s t‑tests.\n\nTwenty‑three male participants (13 adolescents, 10 adults) were randomized: 8 to OV101 5 mg QD, 8 to 5 mg BID, and 7 to 5 mg TID. The cohort exhibited severe neurobehavioral impairment, with mean Stanford‑Binet‑5 Full Scale IQ 41.5 (SD 3.29) and verbal IQ 44.5 (SD 3.23); 82.6% met DSM‑5 criteria for autism spectrum disorder. One participant in each dose group discontinued early: two due to withdrawn consent (QD and TID) and one due to a TEAE of agitation (BID). Mean exposure duration to OV101 was approximately 73–77 days across regimens, and mean treatment compliance was 95.4%, with 21 of 22 evaluable participants meeting the ≥80% compliance threshold.\n\nOV101 was generally well tolerated across all three regimens. Sixteen of 23 participants (69.6%) experienced at least one TEAE (QD 28.6%, BID 100%, TID 75%). The most common TEAEs, occurring in ≥2 participants overall, were upper respiratory tract infection (17.4%), headache (13.0%), diarrhea (8.7%), and irritability (8.7%). All TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity, and most were mild. Eight participants (34.8%) had at least one TEAE considered possibly or probably related to study drug, with the highest number of treatment‑related TEAEs observed in the 5 mg BID group. No SAEs or deaths occurred, and no withdrawals related to serious toxicity were reported. Clinical laboratory values, vital signs, physical examination findings, and ECG measures showed no clinically meaningful trends or differences among dose groups.\n\nIn terms of efficacy, clinician‑rated CGI‑I at week 12 indicated that 60% of OV101‑treated participants were responders (CGI‑I ≤3), including 40% rated as \""much improved\"" and 20% as \""minimally improved.\"" The responder rate was highest in the 5 mg BID group (71.5%), followed by QD (66.6%) and TID (42.9%). CGI‑S total score demonstrated a statistically significant mean reduction (−0.4 points, p<0.01) from baseline to week 12, with significant improvements in subdomains related to communication and connectedness, anxiety, ADHD symptoms, and activities of daily living.\n\nCaregiver‑rated outcomes also suggested behavioral improvements. The ABC‑CFXS total score improved by approximately 26% from baseline (p<0.01), with significant reductions in lethargy/social withdrawal (38%), hyperactivity (29%), stereotypic behavior (21%), and irritability (20%) subscales. Similar patterns were seen when using the original ABC‑C scoring. ADAMS total score decreased significantly (−0.7 points, p<0.01), with notable improvements in general anxiety, social avoidance, and manic/hyperactive subscales. Other secondary measures such as RBS‑R, Short Sensory Profile‑2, and Conners 3 did not show consistent or clinically meaningful changes. Exploratory PGI‑I ratings indicated modest caregiver‑perceived global improvement in 55% of participants, with the highest rate again in the 5 mg BID group (71.4%). The most frequently endorsed top caregiver concerns centered on anxiety, disruptive behaviors, and daily living skills. No clear effect of age group (adolescent vs adult) was observed on behavioral outcomes.\n\nThe trial has important limitations. It lacked a placebo control arm, which is critical in FXS studies where large placebo responses on behavioral scales are well documented and in some cases similar in magnitude to drug effects. The sample size was small overall (n=23) and per treatment arm, limiting the precision of safety estimates and the ability to compare dose regimens or conduct subgroup analyses. Only males with FMR1 full mutation and moderate‑to‑severe impairment were included, so results may not generalize to females or to individuals with milder phenotypes or mosaicism. Objective biomarkers of target engagement and neural function were not incorporated, which would be valuable for reducing reliance on subjective caregiver‑reported outcomes.\n\nOverall, this phase 2a study demonstrates that OV101 at 5 mg QD, BID, or TID is generally safe and well tolerated in adolescent and adult males with FXS and provides an initial signal of behavioral efficacy across multiple clinician‑ and caregiver‑rated domains, particularly at the BID dose. Given the absence of an approved targeted therapy for FXS and the limitations of this small, uncontrolled study, these findings support further investigation of OV101 in larger, randomized, placebo‑controlled trials, with careful selection of outcome measures, incorporation of objective biomarkers, and consideration of optimal dosing and patient subgroups.""}","{""conditions"": [""Fragile X Syndrome"", ""Intellectual Disability"", ""Autism Spectrum Disorder"", ""Anxiety Disorders"", ""Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder""], ""keywords"": [""Fragile X Syndrome"", ""FMR1 Gene"", ""Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein"", ""Autism Spectrum Disorder"", ""Intellectual Disability"", ""Anxiety"", ""Social Withdrawal"", ""Hyperactivity"", ""Irritability"", ""Self-Injurious Behavior"", ""GABAergic Dysfunction"", ""GABAA Receptor"", ""Delta Subunit"", ""Tonic Inhibition"", ""Gaboxadol"", ""OV101"", ""Aberrant Behavior Checklist"", ""ABC-CFX"", ""Anxiety Depression and Mood Scale"", ""ADAMS"", ""Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised"", ""RBS-R"", ""Short Sensory Profile"", ""Conners 3"", ""Clinical Global Impressions"", ""Parent Global Impressions""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Randomized (1:1:1), double-blind, parallel-group, phase 2a study comparing three OV101 5 mg dosing regimens (once daily, twice daily, three-times daily) over 12 weeks in adolescent and adult males with fragile X syndrome."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Double-blind study in which all patients received study medication three times daily; OV101 was administered in the morning and either OV101 or matching placebo in the afternoon and evening to maintain blinding of the assigned dosing regimen."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT"", ""CARE_PROVIDER"", ""INVESTIGATOR"", ""OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 23, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""OV101 5 mg Once Daily (QD)"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Adolescent and adult males with fragile X syndrome received gaboxadol (OV101) 5 mg once daily in the morning plus matching placebo capsules in the afternoon and evening for 12 weeks."", ""interventionNames"": [""Gaboxadol (OV101)"", ""Placebo""]}, {""label"": ""OV101 5 mg Twice Daily (BID)"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Adolescent and adult males with fragile X syndrome received gaboxadol (OV101) 5 mg twice daily (morning and either afternoon or evening per protocol) plus matching placebo capsule for the remaining daily time point so that medication was taken three times per day for 12 weeks."", ""interventionNames"": [""Gaboxadol (OV101)"", ""Placebo""]}, {""label"": ""OV101 5 mg Three Times Daily (TID)"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Adolescent and adult males with fragile X syndrome received gaboxadol (OV101) 5 mg three times daily (morning, afternoon, and evening) for 12 weeks."", ""interventionNames"": [""Gaboxadol (OV101)""]}], ""interventions"": [{""type"": ""DRUG"", ""name"": ""Gaboxadol (OV101)"", ""description"": ""Gaboxadol (OV101) is a δ-subunit–selective, extrasynaptic GABAA receptor agonist.

A total of 256 participants aged 18 years and older were stratified into three age groups (18–55, 56–69, and ≥70 years) and randomized 3:1 to receive two intramuscular doses of AZD1222 or saline placebo 4 weeks apart. The main goals were to assess whether AZD1222 could induce antibody responses against the SARS-CoV-2 spike and receptor-binding domain (RBD) antigens and neutralizing antibodies, and to characterize local and systemic adverse events, serious adverse events, and laboratory safety parameters up to Day 57. AZD1222 induced strong humoral immune responses across all age groups and showed an acceptable safety profile without vaccine-related serious adverse events or deaths."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This ongoing phase 1/2, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multi-centre clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04568031) was designed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of the replication-deficient simian adenovirus–vectored vaccine AZD1222 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) in Japanese adults. The trial is conducted at five centres in Japan, with planned follow-up of 1 year after first dosing; the current report covers data up to Day 57.\n\nEligible participants were adults aged 18 years or older who were seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 at screening and had a negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test. Individuals with a history of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, pregnant women, those with new-onset fever, significant immunodeficiency, recent or planned receipt of vaccines that could interfere with interpretation, or severe/uncontrolled comorbidities were excluded. Mild to moderate, well-controlled comorbidities were permitted.\n\nParticipants were stratified into age cohorts: 18–55 years and ≥56 years, with the ≥56-year cohort further divided into 56–69 years and ≥70 years; approximately 30% of the ≥56-year cohort were aged ≥70 years. Within each cohort, participants were randomized in a 3:1 ratio using an Interactive Response Technology system to receive either AZD1222 or placebo (0.9% saline). AZD1222 was given as two intramuscular injections of 5 × 10^10 viral particles per dose into the deltoid muscle on Days 1 and 29. Study drug preparation was done by an unblinded pharmacist, while participants, investigators, and sponsor staff remained blinded until safety data lock at Day 57.\n\nThe coprimary endpoints were: (1) immunogenicity, defined as seroresponse to the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen at Day 57 (≥4-fold rise in anti-spike antibody titre vs Day 1 baseline); and (2) safety, including solicited local and systemic reactogenicity during the first 6 days after each dose, unsolicited adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and adverse events of special interest (AESIs) for 28 days after each dose, and changes from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters.\n\nImmunogenicity assessments included measurement of anti-spike, anti-RBD, and anti-nucleocapsid antibodies using a validated multiplex electrochemiluminescent assay, and neutralizing antibodies using a validated HIV-1–based pseudovirus neutralization assay. Samples for serology were collected on Days 1, 15, 29, 43, and 57; neutralizing antibody samples were collected on Days 1, 29, and 57. The fully vaccinated analysis set included participants who received both doses, had no major protocol deviations affecting immune response interpretation, and did not show nucleocapsid seroresponse (which would suggest intercurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection) up to Day 57.\n\nSafety assessments included 30 minutes of post-vaccination observation, participant-recorded solicited local and systemic AEs for 6 days after each dose using electronic diaries, and unsolicited AEs for 28 days after each dose. Clinical laboratory safety (haematology and chemistry) was evaluated on Days 1, 8, 29, 36, and 57. AE severity was graded using scales adapted from U.S. FDA toxicity grading guidance. Analyses were descriptive, with Fisher’s exact test used to compare seroresponse proportions and neutralizing antibody response rates between AZD1222 and placebo at a two-sided 5% alpha level; no multiplicity adjustment was performed.\n\nAmong 256 enrolled participants (192 AZD1222 and 64 placebo in the total vaccinated analysis set), baseline characteristics were balanced between groups. All participants were Japanese. The prevalence of key comorbidities at baseline included hypertension (approximately 27%), obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m^2; about 4%), cardiac disorders, and type 1 or type 2 diabetes at lower frequencies.\n\nFor the coprimary immunogenicity endpoint, 100% (174/174) of participants who received two doses of AZD1222 achieved seroresponse to the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen at Day 57, compared with 0% (0/60) in the placebo group (P<0.001 in both age cohorts). Similarly, seroresponse to the RBD antigen at Day 57 was observed in 100% (174/174) of AZD1222 recipients and 0% of placebo recipients. Anti-spike and anti-RBD antibody titres rose substantially after the first dose (Day 29), increased further after the second dose, peaked around Day 43, and remained above pre–second-dose levels at Day 57 across all age cohorts.\n\nNeutralizing antibody responses at Day 57 (defined as ≥4-fold increase vs baseline) were seen in 67.5% of AZD1222 recipients aged 18–55 years, 60.3% aged 56–69 years, and 50.0% aged ≥70 years, with no neutralizing antibody responses in placebo groups. Corresponding neutralizing antibody geometric mean titres (GMTs) at Day 57 were 107.3 (95% CI 84.2–136.7) for 18–55 years, 101.5 (95% CI 74.3–138.5) for 56–69 years, and 70.2 (95% CI 45.6–108.1) for ≥70 years. There was a trend toward lower titres with increasing age, though confidence intervals overlapped. In placebo recipients, antibody titres to spike and RBD and neutralizing antibodies remained at baseline levels.\n\nFor the coprimary safety endpoints, solicited AEs within 6 days of any dose occurred more frequently in AZD1222 recipients than in placebo recipients and were generally mild to moderate. In the 18–55-year cohort, solicited AEs were reported by 85.4% of AZD1222 and 37.5% of placebo recipients; in the 56–69-year group, by 72.3% and 19.0%, respectively; and in the ≥70-year group, by 51.6% and 27.3%, respectively. The most common solicited local AEs were pain and tenderness at the injection site; common systemic AEs included malaise, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, and elevated body temperature. Severe solicited AEs were observed in 9.4% of AZD1222 recipients aged 18–55 years but not in older age groups, and no potentially life-threatening solicited AEs were reported. Reactogenicity tended to be more frequent after the first dose than the second, and was milder and less frequent in participants aged ≥70 years compared with younger adults.\n\nUnsolicited AEs occurring within 28 days after each dose were reported by 28.1%, 21.5%, and 22.6% of AZD1222 recipients aged 18–55, 56–69, and ≥70 years, respectively, versus 9.4%, 28.6%, and 27.3% of placebo recipients in the corresponding age groups. Most unsolicited AEs were mild or moderate, with severe events infrequent and observed in small numbers of both AZD1222 and placebo recipients. The most common unsolicited AEs were consistent with post-vaccination reactions such as injection site pain and tenderness, fatigue, and elevated body temperature. There were no notable imbalances for events not typically associated with vaccination.\n\nNo deaths, vaccine-related SAEs, or AESIs were observed in AZD1222 recipients up to Day 57. One SAE (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3) occurred in a placebo recipient and was considered unrelated to study intervention. Clinical laboratory assessments showed no clinically meaningful differences between AZD1222 and placebo groups. A transient grade 3 neutrophil decrease in one AZD1222 recipient resolved without sequelae, and no clinically relevant changes in platelet counts were seen.\n\nThe study demonstrates that AZD1222 induces robust humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD antigens, as well as neutralizing antibodies, in Japanese adults including older adults, and has an acceptable short-term safety and reactogenicity profile. Immunogenicity results were generally consistent with those observed in non-Japanese populations, particularly in trials with similar dose intervals. Longer-term follow-up and additional data from other studies and real-world use are needed to fully characterize durability of immune responses, cellular immunity, and clinical efficacy, including in special populations not included in this trial.""}","{""conditions"": [""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2 Infection"", ""Coronavirus Infections""], ""keywords"": [""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""ChAdOx1 nCoV-19"", ""AZD1222"", ""COVID-19 Vaccines"", ""Adenovirus-Vectored Vaccines"", ""Neutralizing Antibodies"", ""Humoral Immunity"", ""Immunogenicity"", ""Vaccine Safety"", ""Japan"", ""Older Adults""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": ""P1Y"", ""phases"": [""PHASE1"", ""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Phase 1/2 randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial in Japanese adults evaluating two doses of AZD1222 versus placebo given 4 weeks apart."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""PREVENTION"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Participants, clinical investigators, and sponsor staff were blinded to whether AZD1222 or placebo was administered; an unblinded pharmacist prepared study injections."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT"", ""CARE_PROVIDER"", ""INVESTIGATOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 256, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""AZD1222"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Participants received two doses of AZD1222 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19), 5 × 10^10 viral particles per dose, administered as intramuscular injections into the deltoid muscle on Days 1 and 29."", ""interventionNames"": [""AZD1222 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19)""]}, {""label"": ""Placebo"", ""type"": ""PLACEBO_COMPARATOR"", ""description"": ""Participants received two doses of placebo (0.9% saline), administered as intramuscular injections into the deltoid muscle on Days 1 and 29."", ""interventionNames"": [""Placebo (saline 0.9%)""]}], ""interventions"": [{""type"": ""BIOLOGICAL"", ""name"": ""AZD1222 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19)"", ""description"": ""AZD1222 is a replication-deficient simian adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccine encoding the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

The study found fremanezumab to be generally well tolerated, with mainly mild to moderate injection‑site reactions and nasopharyngitis, a low rate of discontinuations, and infrequent anti‑drug antibody development, along with sustained reductions in migraine frequency and disability over 12 months."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This multicenter, randomized, open‑label, parallel‑group trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03303105) was conducted in Japanese patients with chronic migraine (CM) or episodic migraine (EM) to assess the long‑term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of fremanezumab for migraine prevention. The trial included a 4‑week screening period, a 52‑week treatment period, and a 225‑day post‑treatment follow‑up for anti‑drug antibody (ADA) assessment.\n\nNewly enrolled adult patients had a history of migraine for at least 12 months and fulfilled International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (beta version) criteria (or clinical judgment consistent with migraine). During the 28‑day screening period, EM patients had headache on ≥4 and ≤14 days and CM patients had headache on ≥15 days, with a minimum number of days fulfilling migraine criteria (≥4 days for EM, ≥8 days for CM). A separate cohort of rollover patients from prior phase IIb/III CM and EM trials (Japanese and Korean) was included for immunogenicity evaluation only and did not receive fremanezumab in this study.\n\nNewly enrolled patients were randomized 1:1 using interactive‑response technology, stratified by migraine subtype (CM or EM), to receive either monthly or quarterly fremanezumab by subcutaneous injection. For CM, the monthly regimen consisted of a 675‑mg loading dose (three injections of 225 mg/1.5 mL) at baseline followed by 225 mg monthly. For EM, the monthly regimen was 225 mg at baseline and 225 mg monthly thereafter. For both CM and EM, the quarterly regimen was 675 mg once every 3 months (at baseline, months 3, 6, 9, and 12).\n\nSafety assessments included collection and coding of treatment‑emergent adverse events (TEAEs) by MedDRA, evaluation of their severity, seriousness, and relationship to study drug, and documentation of TEAEs leading to discontinuation. Injection‑site reactions (erythema, induration, ecchymosis, pain) were systematically monitored and graded for size and pain intensity. TEAEs of special interest mirrored those in previous phase IIb/III studies and included injection‑site reactions, potential drug‑induced liver injury, ophthalmic events of at least moderate severity, anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity reactions, and cardiovascular events. Safety monitoring also comprised clinical laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, coagulation, urinalysis), 12‑lead ECGs, physical examinations, vital signs, body weight, and suicidality screening with the Electronic Columbia‑Suicide Severity Rating Scale.\n\nImmunogenicity was assessed in a larger cohort (newly enrolled plus rollover patients) with serial ADA testing. Patients who were ADA‑negative before any fremanezumab exposure and became positive after treatment were classified as having treatment‑emergent ADA. Neutralizing antibody assays were also performed, and potential associations with safety or efficacy outcomes were explored.\n\nEfficacy endpoints for newly enrolled patients were analyzed descriptively in a full analysis set requiring at least 10 days of baseline and post‑baseline entries in an electronic headache diary. Primary efficacy measures included changes from baseline in average monthly migraine days and in monthly headache days of at least moderate severity, normalized to a 28‑day period when ≥10 diary days were available. Additional efficacy outcomes included average monthly headache days of any severity, monthly days with use of any acute headache medication, monthly days with nausea/vomiting, and monthly days with photophobia and phonophobia. Responder analyses examined the proportions of patients achieving ≥50% reductions from baseline in monthly migraine days or monthly headache days of at least moderate severity at months 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12.\n\nDisability and functional impact were measured with validated instruments: the 6‑Item Headache Impact Test (HIT‑6) in CM patients and the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) questionnaire in EM patients. Higher HIT‑6 and MIDAS scores indicate greater headache impact and disability, respectively; changes from baseline at month 12 were summarized.\n\nFifty Japanese patients were newly enrolled and treated (25 monthly, 25 quarterly; 34 with CM and 16 with EM). Most were female (84%), with a mean age of 46.3 years and a long migraine history (mean 20.2 years). Nearly half (46%) were using preventive migraine medications at baseline, and almost all (98%) used acute headache medications; 92% used migraine‑specific acute treatments (triptans or ergot derivatives). The mean baseline monthly migraine days and monthly headache days of at least moderate severity were 13.9 and 12.3, respectively.\n\nTEAEs occurred in 90% of patients overall, most commonly nasopharyngitis (64%) and injection‑site reactions, primarily erythema (24%), induration (10%), pain (8%), and pruritus (6%). All injection‑site reactions were mild or moderate and resolved; one patient discontinued due to an injection‑site reaction. Serious TEAEs occurred in two patients (8%) in the quarterly group (rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and subarachnoid hemorrhage), none considered related to fremanezumab. No deaths, anaphylaxis, severe hypersensitivity reactions, or trial‑agent‑induced liver injury were reported. Cardiovascular TEAEs included hemiparesis (in the context of subarachnoid hemorrhage), tachycardia, increased blood pressure, and hypertension in single patients; these were not judged drug related. Changes in vital signs and ECGs were minor, and no patient developed suicidal ideation or behavior on the C‑SSRS.\n\nIn the immunogenicity cohort of 587 patients, 14 (2.4%) developed treatment‑emergent ADAs, and 12 developed neutralizing antibodies. No clear relationship between ADA positivity and clinical efficacy or safety was identified, and no ADA‑associated anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity occurred.\n\nEfficacy analyses showed that fremanezumab led to early and sustained reductions in migraine and headache frequency. By month 1, monthly migraine days decreased by about 4 days from baseline in both dosing groups, and monthly headache days of at least moderate severity declined by roughly 3.6–4.7 days. At month 12, the mean reduction in monthly migraine days was approximately 5.9 days in the monthly group and 1.6 days in the quarterly group, with corresponding reductions of 4.3 and 2.1 days, respectively, in monthly headache days of at least moderate severity. Similar patterns were seen for headache days of any severity and days with acute medication use, with sustained improvements over 12 months. Responder analyses showed that at 12 months, 43.5% of patients in the monthly group and 22.7% in the quarterly group achieved ≥50% reduction in monthly migraine days; for monthly headache days of at least moderate severity, the corresponding proportions were 34.8% and 18.2%.\n\nHeadache‑related disability improved over time. Among CM patients, mean HIT‑6 scores decreased by about 5 points from baseline to month 12 across both dosing schedules, indicating a clinically meaningful reduction in headache impact. Among EM patients, MIDAS scores also decreased on average, reflecting reduced migraine‑related disability, though variability was high due to the small sample size.\n\nOverall, long‑term monthly or quarterly fremanezumab treatment in Japanese patients with CM or EM showed a favorable safety and immunogenicity profile and produced sustained reductions in migraine frequency, acute medication use, and headache‑related disability over 12 months. The main limitations include the open‑label design, absence of a placebo comparator, and relatively small sample size, which constrain definitive efficacy inferences but support the long‑term safety and tolerability profile established in larger international studies.""}","{""conditions"": [""Chronic Migraine"", ""Episodic Migraine"", ""Migraine Disorders""], ""keywords"": [""Fremanezumab"", ""Monoclonal Antibodies"", ""Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide"", ""CGRP"", ""Migraine Prevention"", ""Chronic Migraine"", ""Episodic Migraine"", ""Headache Disorders"", ""Japanese Population"", ""Long-Term Safety"", ""Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events"", ""Injection-Site Reactions"", ""Immunogenicity"", ""Anti-Drug Antibodies"", ""HIT-6"", ""MIDAS""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""PHASE3""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial comparing monthly vs quarterly subcutaneous fremanezumab dosing regimens in Japanese patients with chronic or episodic migraine over 52 weeks."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""PREVENTION"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Open-label study; no blinding of participants or investigators."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 50, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Fremanezumab Monthly"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Japanese patients with chronic migraine or episodic migraine received fremanezumab in a monthly subcutaneous regimen for 52 weeks.

Twenty‑nine patients who had received at least two prior lines of rituximab-based chemotherapy were randomized 1:1:1 to three combination regimens: avelumab + utomilumab (4‑1BB agonist) + rituximab (arm A), avelumab + utomilumab + azacitidine (arm B), or avelumab + bendamustine + rituximab (arm C). The main goals were to characterize dose‑limiting toxicities and objective response per Lugano criteria. One dose‑limiting toxicity case (two grade 3 events) occurred in arm A; no dose‑limiting toxicities were seen in arms B or C, and no new safety signals for avelumab emerged. Antitumor activity was limited overall: arm A had one partial response, arm C had three complete responses, and arm B had no responses. Because of insufficient activity in arms A and B and infeasibility of expanding arm C, the trial was discontinued before the planned phase III component."", ""detailedDescription"": ""JAVELIN DLBCL (NCT02951156) was designed as a seamless, two‑component (phase Ib followed by planned phase III), multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel‑arm clinical trial to investigate avelumab-based combination regimens in adults with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B‑cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The scientific rationale was based on preliminary evidence that DLBCL may be responsive to PD‑1/PD‑L1 blockade and on preclinical and early clinical data suggesting that combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with other immunomodulatory agents or chemotherapy might augment antitumor immunity.\n\nIn the phase Ib component reported here, patients aged ≥18 years with histologically confirmed DLBCL and relapsed or refractory disease after at least two and up to four prior lines of rituximab‑based multiagent chemotherapy (or at least one rituximab‑containing regimen if ineligible for intensive second‑line therapy) were enrolled. Patients had to have fluorodeoxyglucose‑avid, measurable disease on PET/CT and no prior exposure to PD‑1/PD‑L1, CTLA‑4, 4‑1BB, or other immune checkpoint or costimulatory pathway–targeted therapies. Patients with active CNS lymphoma, prior organ or allogeneic stem cell transplant, or recent anticancer therapy were excluded.\n\nParticipants were randomized 1:1:1 to one of three avelumab‑based regimens:\n- Arm A: avelumab + utomilumab + rituximab. Avelumab 10 mg/kg IV was given every 2 weeks with premedication. Rituximab 375 mg/m² IV was administered on day 1 of each 28‑day cycle for up to 8 cycles. Utomilumab 100 mg IV was given on day 2 of cycles 1–2 (then day 1 from cycle 3 onward if tolerated), at least 1 hour after rituximab, and continued while clinical benefit persisted.\n- Arm B: avelumab + utomilumab + azacitidine. Avelumab and utomilumab dosing mirrored arm A. Azacitidine 40 mg/m² was administered subcutaneously on days 1–5 of each cycle until loss of clinical benefit.\n- Arm C: avelumab + bendamustine + rituximab. Rituximab 375 mg/m² IV was given on day 1 of each cycle for up to 8 cycles. Bendamustine 90 mg/m² IV was given on days 2–3 of cycles 1–2, and if well tolerated, days 1–2 from cycle 3 onward, for a maximum of 6 cycles. Avelumab was administered at least 1 hour after bendamustine, every 2 weeks as in the other arms.\n\nNo dose reductions were allowed for avelumab, rituximab, utomilumab, or azacitidine; bendamustine could be modified by schedule as described. Patients with radiographic progression who were still deriving clinical benefit could continue avelumab and/or utomilumab at the investigator’s discretion.\n\nThe primary endpoints of phase Ib were (1) identification of dose‑limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the DLT evaluation period, graded per NCI CTCAE v4.03, and (2) objective response (complete or partial response) as assessed by investigators using the Lugano Response Classification for lymphoma. Secondary endpoints included PD‑L1 expression and other tumor microenvironment biomarkers at baseline, minimal residual disease (MRD) dynamics via tumor clonotype tracking in plasma (clonoSEQ), duration of response, time to response, disease control rate (CR + PR + stable disease), progression‑free survival and overall survival (Kaplan–Meier analyses), and overall safety. Additional translational objectives included central assessment of cell of origin (activated B‑cell‑like vs germinal center B‑cell‑like) and immunohistochemical characterization of PD‑L1, CD4, CD8, CD68, and 4‑1BB expression.\n\nOf 41 screened patients, 29 were enrolled and randomized (arm A: 9; arm B: 9; arm C: 11) between December 2016 and October 2018. Median age was 70 years and most patients were male. Both relapsed and primary refractory disease were represented, and cases spanned Ann Arbor stages I–IV. Patients had received two to four prior systemic regimens, reflecting a heavily pretreated R/R DLBCL population.\n\nFor DLT evaluation, 7 patients in arm A, 5 in arm B, and 10 in arm C were evaluable. One patient (14.3%) in arm A experienced two grade 3 DLTs (herpes zoster and ophthalmic herpes zoster), considered related to rituximab; these events led to interruption of avelumab and utomilumab and discontinuation of rituximab, and subsequently resolved. No DLTs were reported in arms B or C.\n\nTreatment‑related adverse events (TRAEs) were generally consistent with known profiles of the individual agents. In arm A, 50% of patients experienced a TRAE and 25% had grade ≥3 TRAEs; common events included chills and neutropenia. In arm B, 55.6% had TRAEs and 11.1% had grade ≥3 TRAEs, with neutropenia and chills observed. In arm C, 90.9% had TRAEs and 72.7% had grade ≥3 TRAEs, including high rates of neutropenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia, consistent with bendamustine‑based chemoimmunotherapy. No treatment‑related deaths occurred, and no new safety concerns for avelumab were identified.\n\nEfficacy was limited. In arm A (avelumab/utomilumab/rituximab), the objective response rate (ORR) was 11.1% (95% CI 0.3–48.2), with one partial response and one additional patient achieving stable disease (disease control rate 22.2%). The duration of response in the responding patient was 1.81 months. In arm B (avelumab/utomilumab/azacitidine), no objective responses were observed (ORR 0%; disease control rate 0%). In arm C (avelumab/bendamustine/rituximab), ORR was 27.3% (95% CI 6.0–61.0), with three complete responses and one additional stable disease (disease control rate 36.4%). All three complete responses were ongoing at data cutoff, with durations of at least 6, 8.4, and 19.5 months respectively.\n\nMedian progression‑free survival was short across arms: 1.8 months in arm A, 1.5 months in arm B, and 2.7 months in arm C. Median overall survival was 14.8 months in arm A, 4.0 months in arm B, and 5.2 months in arm C, though interpretation is limited by small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals.\n\nExploratory biomarker analyses suggested heterogeneous biology. Among the three patients with complete responses in arm C, two had germinal center B‑cell‑like and one had activated B‑cell‑like cell of origin. One complete responder converted from MRD‑positive to MRD‑negative status on therapy, with sustained MRD negativity through at least cycle 6. Immunohistochemistry showed variable expression of PD‑L1, T‑cell (CD4, CD8) and macrophage (CD68) markers, and 4‑1BB; the single partial responder in arm A had low 4‑1BB expression (1%). Overall, the limited number of responders precluded robust correlation between biomarker profiles and clinical outcomes.\n\nArms A and B demonstrated insufficient antitumor activity, and although arm C showed some complete responses comparable to historical outcomes with bendamustine/rituximab alone, accrual limitations and the evolving standard of care (including broader use of CAR T‑cell therapies and other novel agents) prevented expansion of this cohort to clarify the incremental contribution of avelumab. Consequently, the study was terminated before proceeding to the planned phase III component.\n\nThe overall findings suggest that, in this heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory DLBCL population, the clinical activity of avelumab‑based combinations with utomilumab, azacitidine, or bendamustine/rituximab was modest and that PD‑L1 inhibition may have limited efficacy in this setting. The choice of partners, timing relative to prior immunosuppressive chemotherapy, and underlying disease biology may all influence the impact of PD‑L1 blockade in DLBCL.""}","{""conditions"": [""Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma"", ""Relapsed Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma"", ""Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma"", ""Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma""], ""keywords"": [""Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma"", ""DLBCL"", ""Relapsed/Refractory DLBCL"", ""Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma"", ""Programmed Death-Ligand 1"", ""PD-L1"", ""Avelumab"", ""Utomilumab"", ""4-1BB"", ""CD137"", ""Rituximab"", ""Bendamustine"", ""Azacitidine"", ""Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors"", ""Monoclonal Antibodies"", ""Salvage Therapy"", ""Chemoimmunotherapy"", ""Minimal Residual Disease"", ""Cell of Origin"", ""Germinal Center B-cell-like"", ""Activated B-cell-like""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""PHASE1"", ""PHASE3""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Multicenter, randomized, open-label, seamless two-component (phase Ib planned to be followed by phase III), parallel-arm trial with three combination-therapy arms in phase Ib."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Open-label study; no blinding of participants, investigators, or outcome assessors."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 29, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Arm A: Avelumab + Utomilumab + Rituximab"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Patients received avelumab 10 mg/kg as a 1-hour intravenous infusion every 2 weeks with mandatory premedication (antihistamine and acetaminophen).

Children who required ophthalmologic treatment for ROP had poorer neurodevelopmental scores, more motor impairment and hearing loss, and worse visual acuity than children with untreated milder ROP."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This investigation is a secondary analysis of the \""Inositol to Reduce Retinopathy of Prematurity\"" randomized controlled trial (NCT01954082), which enrolled infants born extremely preterm (<28 weeks’ gestation) at 18 centers in the NICHD Neonatal Research Network between April 2014 and September 2015. The original trial evaluated whether myo-inositol affected the incidence or severity of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). For this secondary analysis, infants who survived to final ROP status and completed follow-up at 22–26 months’ corrected age were included.\n\nParticipants were classified into three groups based on their ROP history: (1) no ROP, (2) ROP stage ≤3 without ophthalmologic intervention, and (3) ROP with ophthalmologic intervention (retinal ablation, scleral buckling, vitrectomy, or anti-VEGF therapy). The primary objective was to determine whether children with lower stage ROP that regressed without intervention had worse neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years’ corrected age than children without ROP. A secondary objective was to compare these two groups with children who required intervention for ROP.\n\nNeurodevelopment was assessed at 22–26 months’ corrected age using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd Edition (Bayley-III), providing composite motor, cognitive, and language scores (mean 100, SD 15). Children who were untestable because of severe delay were assigned standardized low scores. Behavioral outcomes were evaluated using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), yielding standardized T-scores across syndrome scales, internalizing, externalizing, total problems, and DSM-oriented scales. Neurologic outcomes included results of a detailed neurologic examination, diagnosis of cerebral palsy, and gross motor function classification system (GMFCS) levels. Medical history of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was also recorded.\n\nOphthalmologic outcomes at 22–26 months’ corrected age were documented as part of the neurologic visit and included strabismus, nystagmus, roving eye movements, ability to track 180 degrees, history of eye surgery for non-ROP indications, prescription of corrective lenses, and visual acuity (derived from parent report or medical record). Visual acuity categories distinguished normal vision, vision abnormalities, blindness with some functional vision, and blindness with no functional vision.\n\nBaseline maternal and neonatal characteristics and early neonatal morbidities (e.g., patent ductus arteriosus, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, spontaneous intestinal perforation, intracranial hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, late-onset sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis) were compared between ROP groups. Intracranial hemorrhage was classified using Papile criteria. Small for gestational age status was defined as birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age.\n\nPrimary outcomes (Bayley-III composite scores) were analyzed using generalized linear models with ROP group as the main exposure, adjusting for gestational age, sex, maternal race, and severe intraventricular hemorrhage (grades III–IV), with study center as a random effect. A Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple primary comparisons. Secondary outcomes (neurologic, behavioral, ophthalmologic measures, ASD, GMFCS categories) were analyzed using generalized linear or modified Poisson models with similar covariate adjustment, but without multiplicity correction due to their exploratory nature. A sensitivity analysis adjusting for myo-inositol randomization group did not change the findings.\n\nAmong 506 children evaluated at 22–26 months’ corrected age, 173 (34%) had no ROP, 262 (52%) had ROP stage ≤3 without ophthalmologic intervention, and 71 (14%) had ROP with intervention. Children with ROP stage ≤3 without intervention did not differ from children without ROP in adjusted mean Bayley-III motor, cognitive, or language scores. The incidences of abnormal neurologic examination, cerebral palsy, GMFCS ≥2, and history or suspicion of ASD were also similar between these two groups. CBCL T-scores were largely comparable; although some domains (aggressive behavior, attention deficit/hyperactivity problems, externalizing problems) showed statistically lower (more favorable) scores in the ROP-without-intervention group, differences were small (<2 points) and most children in both groups scored in the normal range.\n\nIn terms of ophthalmologic outcomes, children with ROP stage ≤3 without intervention were more likely to have strabismus than those without ROP (adjusted relative risk ~2.1). There were no significant differences between these two groups in nystagmus, roving eye movements, ability to track 180 degrees, eye surgery for non-ROP indications, or prescription of corrective lenses. A small number of children with ROP stage ≤3 without intervention were blind with some functional vision, but numbers were too low for robust between-group comparisons.\n\nIn contrast, children who had ROP with ophthalmologic intervention demonstrated significantly lower mean Bayley-III motor, cognitive, and language scores compared with children who had ROP stage ≤3 without intervention. They were more likely to have GMFCS level ≥2 and hearing loss, although the overall incidence of cerebral palsy and abnormal neurologic examination did not differ significantly. CBCL behavioral profiles were similar between the intervention and non-intervention ROP groups, with most scores in the normal range. Children with treated ROP had markedly worse visual acuity, with fewer having normal vision and more having significant vision impairment or blindness. The incidence of nystagmus was higher and approached statistical significance in the intervention group, whereas other ophthalmologic measures did not differ clearly after adjustment.\n\nThe authors interpret these findings as evidence that, among extremely preterm infants, milder ROP (stage ≤3) that regresses without intervention is not associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years’ corrected age relative to no ROP, although it is associated with a higher incidence of strabismus and occasional blindness with functional vision. By contrast, ROP severe enough to require ophthalmologic treatment is linked to poorer neurodevelopmental performance, more motor impairment and hearing loss, and substantially worse visual outcomes. These results support tailoring anticipatory counseling for families of extremely preterm infants based on ROP severity, emphasizing that untreated mild ROP does not appear to worsen early neurodevelopment but still warrants ophthalmologic follow-up, while treated ROP is a marker for increased risk of both neurodevelopmental and visual impairment. The authors note limitations including reliance on reported visual acuity rather than standardized testing, potential referral and reporting biases, lack of postnatal growth data, and relatively early age of follow-up, which may not capture later-emerging difficulties in executive function and academic skills.""}","{""conditions"": [""Retinopathy of Prematurity"", ""Premature Birth"", ""Neurodevelopmental Disorders"", ""Vision Disorders"", ""Strabismus"", ""Nystagmus"", ""Cerebral Palsy"", ""Hearing Loss"", ""Autism Spectrum Disorder""], ""keywords"": [""Retinopathy of Prematurity"", ""ROP"", ""Premature Infant"", ""Extremely Preterm Infant"", ""Neurodevelopmental Outcome"", ""Bayley Scales of Infant Development"", ""Bayley-III"", ""Visual Acuity"", ""Strabismus"", ""Nystagmus"", ""Myo-Inositol"", ""Anti-VEGF Therapy"", ""Retinal Ablation"", ""Vitrectomy"", ""Scleral Buckling"", ""Cerebral Palsy"", ""Gross Motor Function Classification System"", ""Behavioral Problems"", ""Child Behavior Checklist"", ""Hearing Loss""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Randomized controlled parallel-group trial of myo-inositol versus placebo in extremely preterm infants (<28 weeks’ gestation), with secondary analysis comparing outcomes by ROP status and intervention."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""PREVENTION"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": null, ""maskingDescription"": null, ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 638, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Myo-inositol"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Infants born extremely preterm (<28 weeks’ gestation) randomized in the Inositol to Reduce Retinopathy of Prematurity trial to receive myo-inositol for prevention of retinopathy of prematurity."", ""interventionNames"": [""Myo-inositol""]}, {""label"": ""Placebo"", ""type"": ""PLACEBO_COMPARATOR"", ""description"": ""Infants born extremely preterm (<28 weeks’ gestation) randomized in the Inositol to Reduce Retinopathy of Prematurity trial to receive placebo instead of myo-inositol."", ""interventionNames"": [""Placebo""]}], ""interventions"": [{""type"": ""DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT"", ""name"": ""Myo-inositol"", ""description"": ""A myo-inositol product provided by Abbott Nutrition and administered in a randomized controlled trial to extremely preterm infants to evaluate its effect on the risk of retinopathy of prematurity."", ""armGroupLabels"": [""Myo-inositol""]}, {""type"": ""DRUG"", ""name"": ""Placebo"", ""description"": ""Placebo control administered to extremely preterm infants in the randomized Inositol to Reduce Retinopathy of Prematurity trial for comparison with myo-inositol."", ""armGroupLabels"": [""Placebo""]}]}","{""primaryOutcomes"": [{""measure"": ""Bayley-III Motor Composite Score"", ""description"": ""Composite motor score from the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd Edition (mean 100, SD 15);

Traditional healers located within 8 km of the Mbarara District HIV clinic were cluster-randomized to either provide point-of-care oral swab HIV testing and counselling to their adult clients (intervention) or to refer clients to local clinics for HIV testing (control). Eligible clients were sexually active adults who had not been tested for HIV in the prior 12 months and had no known HIV diagnosis. The main outcome was whether clients received an HIV test within 90 days of enrolment. The study tested the hypothesis that HIV test uptake would be higher when tests were delivered directly by trusted traditional healers compared with referrals to clinic-based testing."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This study was a parallel-arm, cluster-randomised trial with an embedded qualitative component conducted in Mbarara Township, a rural area in southwestern Uganda with HIV prevalence higher than the national average. The unit of randomisation was the traditional healer, reflecting concerns about cross-contamination if individual clients were randomised. Healers practise four main specialties in Uganda—herbalists, spiritual healers, traditional birth attendants, and bonesetters—and all specialties were eligible.\n\nTraditional healers were eligible as clusters if they were at least 18 years old, located within 8 km of the Mbarara District HIV clinic, listed in a 2018 district-wide census of healers, and saw at least seven clients per week (excluding very low-volume practices). Using stratified randomisation by healer specialty, 17 healers were allocated 1:1 to intervention (n=9) or control (n=8) groups.\n\nClient-level eligibility criteria included age 18 years or older; current receipt of care from a participating healer; history of sexual activity; self-reported absence of HIV testing in the prior 12 months; and no prior HIV diagnosis, consistent with Ugandan Ministry of Health guidance that individuals without testing in the past year are considered of unknown HIV serostatus. Healers screened clients, and research assistants confirmed eligibility and obtained written informed consent in the local language.\n\nAll participating healers first attended a common 1-day educational session on HIV transmission, symptoms, prevention, antiretroviral therapy (ART), and national HIV testing guidelines. Control-group healers then received an additional 1-day training focused on standardised referral procedures. They were instructed to provide HIV education and written referral letters (in English and Runyankole) directing eligible clients to nearby HIV testing facilities. Clients were advised to present for voluntary HIV testing within 90 days.\n\nIntervention-group healers attended a separate 1-day training that covered pre- and post-test counselling, practical administration of oral swab OraQuick HIV tests, hygiene and sample collection techniques, interpretation of results, eligibility criteria, and study documentation. Research assistants provided individually wrapped OraQuick test kits for eligible enrolled clients. Healers offered point-of-care HIV testing on site; they recorded whether the test was accepted and the result using a simple graphical form not requiring literacy. For clients with reactive tests, healers provided information about confirmatory testing locations and linkage to HIV care. Research assistants collected documentation and disposed of test waste but did not view or verify test results to preserve confidentiality.\n\nThe primary outcome was receipt of an HIV test within 90 days of enrolment. In the control arm, this was assessed by self-report during a 90-day follow-up phone call; in the intervention arm, uptake and test results were documented contemporaneously by healers. Secondary outcomes included new HIV diagnoses and linkage to HIV care for those newly diagnosed, also assessed via self-report at 90 days. Newly positive clients were asked about confirmatory testing and ART initiation. Reasons for not testing were collected from control-group clients who remained untested at follow-up. Safety and adverse events were monitored based on prespecified criteria.\n\nSample size calculations assumed an intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.22 and an HIV testing rate of 39% in the control group, with a hypothesised absolute increase of 35 percentage points (to 74%) in the intervention group. With at least 16 clusters and roughly 30 clients per cluster (total ~480 clients), the study had 80% power at a two-sided alpha of 0.05. The target enrolment was 500 clients (250 per arm).\n\nBetween August 2019 and February 2020, 500 eligible clients of unknown HIV serostatus were enrolled (250 per group) across 17 healer clusters, with mean cluster size of 30 participants. At 90 days, follow-up was 99% in the intervention group and 100% in the control group. In the intervention group, 100% (250/250) of clients received an HIV test, versus 23% (57/250) in the control group, corresponding to a 77% absolute increase in uptake (95% CI 73–82; p<0.0001) and a roughly 4.4-fold higher likelihood of testing when accounting for clustering. The ICC was 0 in the intervention arm (no variability in testing uptake) and 0.28 in the control arm.\n\nAmong intervention clients, 10 of 250 (4%) had a new HIV diagnosis; no new cases were identified in the control group (p=0.0018). Of the ten newly diagnosed individuals, seven reported confirmatory HIV-positive results, linkage to HIV care, and ART initiation within 90 days. One did not seek care in that period, and two were lost to follow-up, leaving their linkage outcomes unknown. No adverse events or safety concerns were reported.\n\nIn the control group, 193 clients did not test within 90 days. The most commonly reported barriers were lack of time to attend clinic-based testing (78%) and insufficient funds for transportation (70%). Multivariate analysis among control clients revealed that higher HIV risk scores, being enrolled at bonesetter practices, and younger age were all associated with lower likelihood of undergoing clinic-based HIV testing.\n\nAfter the trial, qualitative interviews were conducted with all 17 healers and 107 clients (67 control, 40 intervention). Content analysis showed that healer-delivered HIV testing was highly acceptable. Clients described traditional healers as trusted and more confidential than clinic staff, reducing anticipated stigma associated with HIV testing. Healers reported that OraQuick tests were easy to use and that they felt empowered to support their clients’ health. Control clients highlighted structural and psychosocial barriers—time, transport costs, mobility limitations due to injuries, and fear of a positive result—as reasons for avoiding facility-based testing, especially among those engaging in higher-risk behaviours.\n\nThe study demonstrates that traditional healers can effectively deliver point-of-care HIV testing, achieve very high uptake and meaningful linkage to care, and potentially transform their role in the HIV service cascade—from contributing to delayed diagnosis to becoming facilitators of early testing. Given the widespread presence of traditional healers in sub-Saharan Africa, this strategy may provide a scalable, community-based approach to reach populations with historically low engagement in HIV testing, including rural men, young adults, and individuals with high-risk sexual behaviours. The authors note the need for future work on cost-effectiveness, generalisability to lower-volume practices and other settings, and the influence of individual healer characteristics on intervention success.""}","{""conditions"": [""HIV Infections"", ""Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome"", ""Sexually Transmitted Diseases""], ""keywords"": [""HIV testing"", ""HIV counselling"", ""HIV self-testing"", ""Point-of-care testing"", ""Traditional healers"", ""Faith healers"", ""Community-based health services"", ""Sub-Saharan Africa"", ""Uganda"", ""Linkage to care"", ""Antiretroviral therapy"", ""HIV prevention"", ""Oral fluid rapid HIV tests"", ""OraQuick"", ""Cluster randomized trial""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Parallel-arm cluster-randomised trial in which traditional healers (clusters) were randomised 1:1 to provide point-of-care HIV testing versus referral to clinics; individual clients nested within healer clusters were followed for 90 days."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Open-label cluster-randomised trial; blinding of participants and study staff was not possible due to the nature of the intervention."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 500, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Traditional healer-delivered point-of-care HIV testing"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Traditional healers provided HIV pre-test counselling and offered point-of-care HIV testing using OraQuick oral swab kits directly at the healer practice to adult clients of unknown HIV serostatus.

Fifty right‑handed volunteers received a single oral dose of 20 mg immediate‑release MPH or placebo and then performed an N‑back working memory task (1‑back, 3‑back) during functional MRI under two conditions: safety and threat of unpredictable electric shock (induced anxiety). The main hypothesis was that MPH would alter the balance between the fronto‑parietal control network (FPCN) and default mode network (DMN), potentially expanding overall neural processing resources so that both demanding cognition and anxiety‑related processing could be supported without mutual interference. The study assessed working memory accuracy and reaction times, subjective anxiety, and task‑related BOLD activation to test whether cognitive enhancement can facilitate anxiety processing while preserving or improving cognitive performance."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This study investigated the neural mechanisms by which cognitive engagement can reduce or modulate anxiety, focusing on the interaction between anxiety and working memory and how this interaction is altered by a cognitive enhancer, methylphenidate (MPH). Prior behavioral work suggested that while anxiety typically impairs cognition, performing a demanding task can lessen anxiety, and that cognitive resources may be more expandable than traditional limited‑capacity models propose. The present experiment extended those findings to the neural level using functional MRI.\n\nSeventy healthy volunteers were initially recruited; after exclusions (missing fMRI data, incomplete behavioral data, excessive head motion), the final sample comprised 50 healthy, right‑handed adults without current or past Axis I psychiatric disorders or significant medical/neurological conditions and without family history of psychiatric disorders in first‑degree relatives. Participants were free of psychotropic medications, tobacco, and illicit drugs, and had IQ ≥ 80 and no prior chronic MPH use. All provided informed consent under a National Institute of Mental Health IRB‑approved protocol.\n\nThe study used a randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, between‑subjects design. Participants received a single oral dose of either 20 mg immediate‑release MPH (Ritalin) or placebo, in identical capsules, 90 minutes before beginning the experimental task in a 3 T MRI scanner. This dosing and timing were chosen based on prior work indicating cognitive effects at this dose and known pharmacokinetics (peak plasma levels at approximately 1–2 hours). Side effects were monitored with a clinician‑administered 34‑item Adverse Events Checklist.\n\nCognitive function was probed with an N‑back working memory (WM) task using visually presented letters. Two WM loads were tested: 1‑back (low load) and 3‑back (high load). In each block, letters were presented sequentially, and participants responded whether the current letter matched the letter N positions back. Approximately one‑third of trials were targets. An instruction screen indicated the upcoming load (1‑back or 3‑back) before each block.\n\nAnxiety was experimentally induced using the threat of unpredictable electric shocks. Task blocks occurred in two alternating contexts: \""Safe\"" blocks (signaled by blue color around stimuli), during which participants were told no shocks would occur, and \""Threat\"" blocks (orange color), during which unpredictable shocks could be delivered at any time. Participants received a total of six shocks during the task (three per run), with intensity calibrated individually beforehand. Thus, anxiety was manipulated independently of working memory load.\n\nThe task consisted of two runs separated by about 10 minutes. Each run included eight blocks of 45 seconds, with 18 letter trials per block. Within each run, there were two blocks of each condition: 1‑back/safe, 1‑back/threat, 3‑back/safe, and 3‑back/threat, with safe and threat blocks alternating. The order of runs (starting with safe vs. threat) was counterbalanced across participants. Run‑1 represented a context of relative task novelty, whereas Run‑2 reflected increased familiarity.\n\nFunctional MRI data were acquired on a 3 T Siemens Skyra system using multi‑echo EPI and high‑resolution multi‑echo T1‑weighted MPRAGE structural images. Preprocessing and analysis were conducted with AFNI and FreeSurfer, including optimal combination of multi‑echo images, skull stripping, nonlinear normalization to ICBM 2009c space, motion correction, and modeling of nuisance regressors (motion parameters, low‑frequency drifts, shock onsets). At the first level, separate regressors modeled each task condition (1‑back/safe, 1‑back/threat, 3‑back/safe, 3‑back/threat), and a general linear test contrasted 3‑back vs. 1‑back to isolate WM load effects. Second‑level analyses used mixed‑effects general linear models with Drug (MPH vs. placebo), Condition (safe vs. threat), Run (1 vs. 2), and Load contrast (3‑back vs. 1‑back) as fixed factors, Subjects as random factor, and sex and age as covariates. Whole‑brain correction for multiple comparisons used cluster‑level thresholding with 3dClustSim.\n\nBehavioral performance (accuracy and reaction times) was analyzed using linear mixed‑effects models with Drug, Load, Condition, and Run as fixed effects, Subjects as a random effect, and sex and age as covariates. General state anxiety was assessed via the STAI‑state scale at three time points: immediately after drug administration (before expected pharmacologic action), 45 minutes post‑dose, and after exiting the scanner. Additional anxiety measures during fMRI were collected but detailed in supplemental material.\n\nAs a quality‑control step, the 3‑back vs. 1‑back contrast reliably activated task‑positive regions (fronto‑parietal control network) and deactivated task‑negative regions (default mode network), consistent with past working memory literature. Behaviorally, higher WM load (3‑back) produced lower accuracy and slower reaction times than 1‑back, and performance improved from Run‑1 to Run‑2.\n\nMPH tended to improve overall working memory accuracy compared to placebo across conditions. The key hypotheses concerned how MPH would affect the functional balance between the fronto‑parietal control network (FPCN) and the default mode network (DMN) under anxiety and cognitive load. Three mechanistic scenarios were proposed: (A) MPH increases dissociation between FPCN and DMN (stronger FPCN activation with greater DMN deactivation); (B) MPH redistributes cognitive resources with greater efficiency (reduced FPCN activation, increased DMN activation); or (C) MPH expands overall neural resources, simultaneously enhancing FPCN and DMN engagement.\n\nNeuroimaging results during Run‑1 (when the task was novel and thus most demanding) under threat showed a Drug × Condition interaction. Under threat in Run‑1, the MPH group exhibited significantly stronger activation than placebo in parietal and cingulate regions, including left superior parietal lobule (a posterior FPCN node) and PCU/PCC, as well as in the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex and left lateral occipital cortex. Decomposition revealed that during Run‑1/safe, FPCN regions were activated and DMN regions were relatively unchanged in both groups. However, during Run‑1/threat, MPH preserved or increased activation in FPCN regions (e.g., SPL) while also maintaining or enhancing activation in DMN regions (PCU, PCC, lateral OFC), whereas placebo was associated with task‑related activation in FPCN under safe conditions but a loss of activation (or deactivation) in these and DMN regions under threat.\n\nThis pattern is consistent with the \""resource expansion\"" hypothesis: in the most demanding context (high WM load, induced anxiety, novel task), MPH appears to expand available neural processing resources, allowing simultaneous robust recruitment of FPCN for cognitive performance and DMN for processing anxiety‑related, self‑referential or internally directed information, instead of enforcing a strict competition between the two networks. In contrast, placebo subjects showed more canonical task‑related activation/deactivation patterns that suggest limited capacity, with anxiety‑related demands reducing effective recruitment of these systems during high load.\n\nBy Run‑2, when the task was more familiar and presumably less demanding, the Drug × Condition interaction no longer yielded significant clusters at the whole‑brain level. Although there were trends for somewhat greater FPCN activation and less DMN deactivation with MPH, MPH and placebo did not significantly differ in neural or behavioral measures in this later run. This supports the idea that MPH effects are most evident under high task demand, high anxiety, and novelty.\n\nSubjective state anxiety increased over the course of the visit in both groups, with a significant Drug × Time interaction indicating a steeper increase in STAI‑state scores in the MPH group. Average anxiety levels did not differ between groups overall, but the time course suggested that MPH may facilitate awareness or processing of anxiety. Importantly, enhanced working memory performance in the MPH group occurred despite equal or greater subjective anxiety, consistent with the idea that expanded resources can support both cognitive demands and anxiety processing concurrently.\n\nThe authors interpret these findings as evidence that cognitive resources are not strictly limited but can be expanded pharmacologically under certain conditions. MPH seems to increase the capacity of networks supporting both executive control (FPCN) and self‑referential/emotion‑related processing (DMN), enabling more complete processing and potential regulation of anxiety without compromising ongoing cognitive performance. This challenges dominant limited‑resource models of anxiety–cognition interactions and suggests new avenues for therapeutic strategies that aim to enhance cognitive capacity or its flexible allocation in the context of anxiety disorders. The study is limited by its healthy volunteer sample, absence of plasma MPH measurements, lack of physiological anxiety measures in the scanner comparable to prior work, and the fact that stimulants are not clinical treatments for anxiety. Nonetheless, it provides proof‑of‑concept support for the neural expandability of processing resources relevant to anxiety regulation.""}","{""conditions"": [""Anxiety"", ""Anxiety Disorders"", ""Working Memory"", ""Cognition"", ""Stress, Psychological""], ""keywords"": [""Anxiety"", ""Induced anxiety"", ""Threat of shock"", ""Working memory"", ""N-Back task"", ""Cognition"", ""Methylphenidate"", ""Ritalin"", ""Psychostimulants"", ""Frontoparietal control network"", ""Default mode network"", ""Functional magnetic resonance imaging"", ""fMRI"", ""Attention"", ""Cognitive enhancement"", ""Startle reflex"", ""State-Trait Anxiety Inventory"", ""STAI"", ""Salience network"", ""Executive function"", ""Emotion regulation"", ""Task-positive network"", ""Task-negative network"", ""Stress, Psychological""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in which participants received a single oral dose of methylphenidate 20 mg or placebo and completed two fMRI runs of an N-back working memory task under alternating safety and threat-of-shock conditions."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""BASIC_SCIENCE"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Double-blind design: participants and study staff were blinded to assignment of methylphenidate 20 mg vs. placebo, with drugs provided in identical-appearing capsules according to a pharmacy-generated randomization schedule."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT"", ""INVESTIGATOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 50, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Methylphenidate"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Participants received a single oral dose of 20 mg immediate-release methylphenidate (Ritalin) 90 minutes prior to beginning the N-back working memory task performed during fMRI.

The study compared IDP-126 with its three component dyad gels (clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide/adapalene, clindamycin/adapalene) and with vehicle gel over 12 weeks of treatment. The hypothesis was that combining an antibiotic, an antibacterial agent, and a retinoid in a single fixed-dose formulation would provide superior efficacy and acceptable tolerability, potentially improving adherence and reducing antibiotic resistance compared with dyad or vehicle treatments."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This was a phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled study conducted at 35 centers in the USA and Canada. Participants were 9 years of age or older with moderate (Evaluator’s Global Severity Score [EGSS] 3) or severe (EGSS 4) facial acne. Key inclusion criteria required 30–100 inflammatory lesions (pustules, papules, nodules), 35–150 noninflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones), and no more than two nodules on the face at baseline. The pathophysiologic rationale was to target multiple mechanisms in acne—Cutibacterium acnes proliferation, abnormal keratinization, sebum-related inflammation—by combining an antibiotic (clindamycin), an antibacterial/keratolytic agent (benzoyl peroxide), and a topical retinoid (adapalene) in a single aqueous gel.\n\nA total of 741 participants were randomized in equal proportions to five arms: (1) triple-combination clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/benzoyl peroxide 3.1%/adapalene 0.15% gel (IDP-126); (2) benzoyl peroxide 3.1%/adapalene 0.15% gel; (3) clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/benzoyl peroxide 3.1% gel; (4) clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/adapalene 0.15% gel; or (5) vehicle gel. All active formulations used the same polymeric, alcohol-free, preservative-free aqueous gel vehicle, with micronized benzoyl peroxide and adapalene for enhanced follicular penetration and potentially improved tolerability. Study medication was applied once daily to the entire face for 12 weeks. Standard cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen (CeraVe products) were provided to standardize skin care.\n\nCoprimary efficacy endpoints were: (1) treatment success at week 12, defined as a ≥2-grade reduction from baseline in EGSS plus an EGSS of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear); and (2) least-squares mean absolute changes from baseline to week 12 in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts. Secondary and post hoc endpoints included treatment success and ≥2-grade EGSS reduction at interim visits (weeks 2, 4, 8, 12), percent changes in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts over time, and changes in acne-related health-related quality of life assessed by the Acne-Specific Quality of Life (Acne-QoL) questionnaire (domains: self-perception, role-emotional, role-social, acne symptoms).\n\nSafety and tolerability assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and investigator- and patient-rated cutaneous signs and symptoms (scaling, erythema, hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, itching, burning, stinging) graded on a 0–3 scale (none to severe). Treatment compliance was defined as missing no more than 5 consecutive doses and using 80–120% of expected applications.\n\nEfficacy analyses used the intent-to-treat population (all randomized participants who received study drug). Treatment success at week 12 was evaluated via logistic regression including treatment and analysis center as factors. Because of skewness in change-from-baseline lesion counts, data were rank-transformed and analyzed by analysis of covariance, with treatment and center as factors and baseline lesion counts as covariates. Missing efficacy data were handled using Markov Chain Monte Carlo multiple imputation. For some logistic models with convergence issues, Firth’s penalized likelihood was applied. Statistical significance was set at two-sided p ≤ 0.05.\n\nOf the 741 randomized participants, 740 formed the intent-to-treat set and 725 formed the safety set. Baseline characteristics were balanced: mean age was about 19.5 years, 61% were female, approximately 69% were White, and about 80–86% had moderate acne (EGSS 3). Mean baseline inflammatory lesion counts were around 38–40 and noninflammatory lesion counts about 48–52. Treatment compliance was ≥93% across groups.\n\nAt week 12, IDP-126 achieved treatment success in 52.5% of participants, significantly higher than all three dyad combinations (27.8–30.5%) and vehicle (8.1%; p ≤ 0.001 for all comparisons). Least-squares mean absolute reductions in inflammatory lesions with IDP-126 were −29.9, vs −26.7, −24.8, −26.8 for the dyads and −19.6 for vehicle; reductions in noninflammatory lesions were −35.5 with IDP-126, vs −29.9, −27.8, −30.0 for the dyads and −21.8 for vehicle (all comparisons to IDP-126 p < 0.05 or better). These changes corresponded to more than 70% mean reductions in both inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions by week 12 with IDP-126. Significant differences versus vehicle in lesion percent reduction were apparent as early as week 2 and maintained through week 12; superiority versus each dyad was generally evident by week 4 for several lesion-type and visit combinations.\n\nBy study end, 58.7% of IDP-126-treated participants achieved at least a 2-grade EGSS improvement, compared with 35.8–37.0% for the dyads and 12.5% for vehicle. Acne-QoL improvements at week 12 were numerically greatest with IDP-126 in all domains, particularly self-perception and role-emotional, indicating meaningful improvements in patient-reported outcomes.\n\nIn terms of safety, TEAEs were reported by 36.2% of participants in the IDP-126 group and 35.6% in the benzoyl peroxide/adapalene group, compared with 18.1% (clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide), 27.0% (clindamycin/adapalene), and 15.1% (vehicle). Most TEAEs were mild or moderate; severe events were infrequent. The most common treatment-related TEAEs were application-site pain and dryness. Four participants experienced SAEs (one in IDP-126, three in clindamycin/adapalene), none related to study treatment. Discontinuations due to TEAEs were relatively low overall, but highest in the benzoyl peroxide/adapalene group (5.5%), versus 2.8% for IDP-126, 0% for clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide, 2.0% for clindamycin/adapalene, and 1.4% for vehicle.\n\nCutaneous tolerability showed transient increases in signs and symptoms (e.g., scaling, burning, stinging) at weeks 2–4 in all active arms, with mean scores ≤0.6 (mild) at all visits. By week 12, fewer than 6% of participants in any group experienced severe ratings for any cutaneous parameter. In the IDP-126 group, there were no severe cases of scaling, erythema, or itching, and <5% reported severe hyperpigmentation, burning, or stinging. Overall, IDP-126 appeared slightly more tolerable than the benzoyl peroxide/adapalene dyad, which had higher rates of severe burning and stinging and more discontinuations due to TEAEs.\n\nThe study supports that a fixed-dose triple-combination of clindamycin, benzoyl peroxide, and adapalene can provide superior efficacy compared with their dyad combinations and vehicle, while maintaining acceptable tolerability and safety over 12 weeks in pediatric, adolescent, and adult patients with moderate-to-severe acne. By targeting multiple acne pathogenic pathways in a single, once-daily formulation, IDP-126 may improve treatment adherence and help mitigate the risk of antibiotic resistance by incorporating benzoyl peroxide with a topical antibiotic. Longer-term and broader-population studies are needed to further characterize sustained efficacy, safety, antibiotic resistance patterns, and real-world effectiveness.""}","{""conditions"": [""Acne Vulgaris"", ""Moderate Acne"", ""Severe Acne""], ""keywords"": [""Acne"", ""Acne vulgaris"", ""Moderate-to-severe acne"", ""Facial acne"", ""Clindamycin"", ""Clindamycin phosphate"", ""Benzoyl peroxide"", ""Adapalene"", ""Topical retinoids"", ""Topical antibiotics"", ""Fixed-dose combination"", ""Triple-combination therapy"", ""Randomized controlled trial"", ""Topical gel"", ""Cutibacterium acnes"", ""Lesion counts"", ""Evaluator’s Global Severity Score"", ""Quality of life"", ""Acne-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire"", ""Antibiotic resistance""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled study with five arms (IDP-126, three component dyad gels, and vehicle), applied once daily for 12 weeks."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Double-blind study in which participants and investigators were blinded; identically labeled and packaged study drug kits were used for all treatment arms."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT"", ""INVESTIGATOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 741, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""IDP-126 gel"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Once-daily topical application of clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/benzoyl peroxide 3.1%/adapalene 0.15% gel (IDP-126) to the face for 12 weeks."", ""interventionNames"": [""Clindamycin/Benzoyl Peroxide/Adapalene Gel (IDP-126)"", ""Standardized Skin Care (CeraVe cleanser, moisturizer, sunscreen)""]}, {""label"": ""BPO/ADAP gel"", ""type"": ""ACTIVE_COMPARATOR"", ""description"": ""Once-daily topical application of benzoyl peroxide 3.1%/adapalene 0.15% gel to the face for 12 weeks.

JTA‑004 is an enhanced protein solution derived from human plasma, supplemented with hyaluronic acid and clonidine, designed to provide short‑term pain relief and restore joint homeostasis through formation of a clot-like gel in the joint. In stage one, three different JTA‑004 formulations (varying in clonidine dose and injection volume) were compared with a reference hyaluronic acid product (hylan G‑F 20) to select the most effective formulation based on pain reduction at 3 and 6 months. In stage two, the selected formulation was compared with the reference to test whether it provided superior pain relief at 6 months. Efficacy was assessed mainly by WOMAC pain, function, stiffness, and total scores, along with health‑related quality of life and analgesic/NSAID use. Safety was evaluated by adverse events, laboratory tests, and physical examinations over 6 months after a single injection."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This prospective, multicenter, randomized, double‑blind, controlled phase II/III study was conducted in 12 centers in Belgium to assess the safety and efficacy of JTA‑004, an enhanced protein solution for intra‑articular injection in patients with symptomatic primary knee osteoarthritis (OA).\n\nJTA‑004 is derived from human plasma and contains hyaluronic acid (HA) produced by bacterial fermentation and clonidine, an alpha‑2 adrenergic agonist with analgesic properties. Once injected into the knee joint, the plasma component is intended to initiate the coagulation cascade and form a clotting gel. This three‑dimensional network of plasma proteins, hyaluronic acid fibers, and synovial proteins is designed to mimic the mechanical and rheological behavior of normal synovial fluid, providing lubrication and shock‑absorbing properties that may protect cartilage. Clonidine is intended to provide short‑term pain relief around the injection. Overall, JTA‑004 aims to improve local pain and function and potentially delay the need for joint replacement surgery.\n\nThe trial enrolled men and women aged 50–79 years with primary knee OA, Kellgren‑Lawrence grade II or III, body mass index <35 kg/m², and insufficient or failed response to analgesics and/or non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Patients needed to have knee pain ≥40 mm on a 0–100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) in the 3 days before screening, morning stiffness ≤30 minutes, and be able to walk unassisted (crutches or a walking stick were allowed). Patients had to agree to abstain from knee physical therapy and braces during the study.\n\nThe study used a two‑stage design with an interim analysis. In stage one, patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive a single intra‑articular injection of one of three JTA‑004 formulations or a reference treatment, hylan G‑F 20 (Synvisc‑One®), a well‑established hyaluronic acid derivative. The three JTA‑004 formulations differed by clonidine concentration and injection volume but contained the same HA concentration (10 mg/ml):\n- JTA‑100/2: 2 ml injection with 2.04 g plasma protein solution (1.02 g/ml), 100 μg clonidine (50 μg/ml), 20 mg HA (10 mg/ml).\n- JTA‑200/2: 2 ml injection with 2.04 g plasma protein solution (1.02 g/ml), 200 μg clonidine (100 μg/ml), 20 mg HA (10 mg/ml).\n- JTA‑200/4: 4 ml injection with 4.08 g plasma protein solution (1.02 g/ml), 200 μg clonidine (50 μg/ml), 40 mg HA (10 mg/ml).\n\nThe reference group received a 6 ml injection of hylan G‑F 20 containing 48 mg sodium hyaluronate. JTA‑004 was supplied as a freeze‑dried powder for reconstitution with sterile water immediately before use. Injections were performed into the target knee via a lateral mid‑patellar or other standard intra‑articular portal. If joint effusion was present, it was aspirated before injection. Use of local anesthesia was at the physician’s discretion. Patients were monitored for 45 minutes after injection and advised to rest and apply ice for pain control.\n\nThe primary objective of the first stage was to identify the most effective JTA‑004 formulation by comparing adjusted mean changes from baseline in the WOMAC (Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) Pain Subscale Score at 3 months between each JTA group and the reference group. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) performed an interim analysis when 116 patients had completed 3 months of follow‑up or discontinued, using an ANCOVA model adjusted for baseline values and Dunnett’s correction for multiple comparisons. Because 3‑month findings were inconclusive, pre‑specified 6‑month data were also considered. Based on the largest advantage in pain reduction at 6 months, JTA‑200/2 (200 μg clonidine, 20 mg HA, 2 ml) was selected for stage two.\n\nThe primary objective of the second stage was to demonstrate superiority of the selected JTA‑200/2 formulation over hylan G‑F 20, defined as an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the between‑group difference (JTA‑200/2 minus reference) in adjusted mean change from baseline in WOMAC Pain Subscale Score at 6 months that was less than 0. Secondary endpoints included WOMAC Total Score and WOMAC Pain Subscale Score at 3 months. Exploratory endpoints included WOMAC Pain Subscale over all timepoints, WOMAC Physical Function and Stiffness Subscales, WOMAC Total Score at 6 months, SF‑12 physical and mental component scores, and consumption of analgesics and NSAIDs.\n\nPatients were followed on the day of injection and at approximately 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. WOMAC VA3.1 scores (pain, stiffness, physical function) were collected as self‑administered VAS‑based questionnaires (0–100 mm, higher values indicating worse symptoms). The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was defined as 20% or at least 10 mm improvement from baseline. Health‑related quality of life was determined by the SF‑12 questionnaire. Analgesic and NSAID use was recorded using patient diaries. Safety evaluations included adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), treatment‑related and procedure‑related events, vital signs, physical examination findings, and routine laboratory parameters (hematology, chemistry, coagulation).\n\nSample‑size calculations assumed a mean between‑group difference of −7 mm in WOMAC Pain Subscale Score change from baseline at 6 months (favoring JTA‑004) with a standard deviation (SD) of 10.5 mm, requiring 37 patients per group for 80% power at a two‑sided alpha of 0.05. Accounting for 10% drop‑out, 41 patients per group (164 total) were planned. At the interim analysis, because observed variability of the primary endpoint was much larger (SD 25–30 mm), the IDMC recommended increasing the sample size to 76 patients per group to avoid underpowering the study, but this recommendation was not implemented; recruitment stopped at the originally planned 41 patients per group.\n\nAt final analysis, 164 randomized patients were treated (41 per group), and 147 completed the 6‑month follow‑up. Baseline characteristics were comparable across groups: mean age 62.7 years, 68.3% female, mean BMI 28.5 kg/m², and Kellgren‑Lawrence grade II in 55.5% and III in 44.5% of patients.\n\nIn the interim analysis, all three JTA‑004 formulations showed greater reductions from baseline in WOMAC Pain Subscale Score than the reference at 3 and 6 months, but with broad CIs. At 3 months the largest difference versus reference favored JTA‑200/4, while at 6 months the largest difference favored JTA‑200/2. Similarly, for WOMAC Total and Physical Function Subscale Scores, JTA‑200/4 appeared most favorable at 3 months and JTA‑200/2 at 6 months. Based on trends at 6 months, the IDMC selected JTA‑200/2 as the most effective formulation, with no major safety concerns noted.\n\nIn the final analysis, mean baseline WOMAC Pain Subscale Scores were 56.2 mm in the JTA‑200/2 group and 46.5 mm in the reference group. At 6 months, adjusted mean changes in WOMAC Pain Subscale Score from baseline (without imputing missing data) were −23.6 mm (SE 4.6) with JTA‑200/2 and −14.1 mm (SE 4.3) with hylan G‑F 20, yielding a between‑group difference of −9.49 mm (95% CI −22.21 to 3.23; p=0.141). This difference exceeded the pre‑defined MCID of 10 mm and suggested a clinically relevant advantage for JTA‑200/2 but did not meet the statistical criteria for superiority. With missing‑data imputation, the between‑group difference was attenuated (−4.69 mm; 95% CI −16.90 to 7.52; p=0.447).\n\nAt 3 months, adjusted mean changes in pain were −26.8 mm (SE 3.9) for JTA‑200/2 and −15.1 mm (SE 3.7) for the reference, a between‑group difference of −11.63 mm (95% CI −22.60 to −0.66; p=0.038), which did not reach the stricter multiplicity‑adjusted significance threshold (p<0.025) specified for secondary endpoints.\n\nFor the WOMAC Total Score, adjusted mean changes at 3 months were −22.3 mm (SE 3.8) with JTA‑200/2 and −19.4 mm (SE 3.6) with the reference; at 6 months, −23.7 mm (SE 4.3) and −16.5 mm (SE 4.1), respectively. None of the between‑group differences achieved statistical significance. Similar patterns were observed for the WOMAC Physical Function Subscale and Stiffness Subscale: both groups improved over time, and JTA‑200/2 generally showed numerically greater improvements, but differences were not statistically significant.\n\nSF‑12 physical and mental scores showed high variability, and no clear differences could be drawn between groups. Analgesic and NSAID consumption did not demonstrate consistent or clinically meaningful differences between treatment arms.\n\nPost‑hoc exploratory analyses examined the non‑selected JTA‑004 formulations and pooled all JTA‑004 groups. In the JTA‑100/2 and JTA‑200/4 groups, pain scores improved over time, with statistical significance versus reference at 3 months only for JTA‑200/4. When data from all three JTA‑004 formulations were pooled, the magnitude of improvement in WOMAC Pain Subscale Score exceeded that of the reference group at both 3 and 6 months. At 3 months, adjusted mean changes were −27.2 mm (SE 2.2) for pooled JTA versus −16.4 mm (SE 3.7) for reference, yielding a difference of −10.79 mm (p=0.014). At 6 months, adjusted mean changes were −26.1 mm (SE 2.4) versus −15.6 mm (SE 4.1), a difference of −10.57 mm (p=0.030). These differences were both statistically significant and clinically meaningful (greater than 10 mm). For WOMAC Physical Function, the pooled JTA group also showed larger improvements than reference, with a statistically significant difference at 3 months (−8.97 mm; p=0.040) and a borderline difference at 6 months (−9.40 mm; p=0.053). However, pooled analyses did not demonstrate a significant difference in WOMAC Total Score.\n\nSafety assessments showed that JTA‑004 had a clinically acceptable safety profile. Over a mean follow‑up of 6.3 months, 70.7% of patients experienced at least one AE, with similar overall incidence across treatment groups. A total of 49 AEs were considered related to study treatment: 5 in 3 (7.3%) patients in JTA‑100/2, 12 in 8 (19.5%) in JTA‑200/2, 15 in 12 (29.3%) in JTA‑200/4, and 17 in 11 (26.8%) in the reference group. Fewer treatment‑related and procedure‑related AEs occurred in the JTA‑100/2 arm. Common treatment‑ or procedure‑related events included arthralgia, injection site pain, and transient hypotension. Mild, short‑lasting hypotension after injection occurred in four patients in JTA‑200/4 and two in JTA‑200/2 and was not seen in JTA‑100/2 or the reference group. These events were potentially related to clonidine’s pharmacologic effect or vasovagal reactions.\n\nEleven SAEs occurred in eight patients across all groups; no individual SAE occurred in more than one patient. One JTA‑200/2 patient experienced an acute osteomyelitis event and two chronic osteomyelitis events at the injection site, initially reported as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR). After detailed review, these events were judged not related to the study treatment or injection procedure. Two AEs led to study withdrawal (one arthralgia in JTA‑100/2 and one osteomyelitis case in JTA‑200/2). No deaths were reported.\n\nOverall, the study suggests that a single intra‑articular injection of JTA‑004 is safe and may provide clinically relevant improvements in pain and function comparable to or greater than those achieved with hylan G‑F 20 in patients with symptomatic knee OA. However, due to higher than anticipated variability and underpowering, the trial did not demonstrate formal statistical superiority of the selected JTA‑200/2 formulation over the reference for the primary endpoint. Post‑hoc pooled analyses indicate a potentially clinically meaningful benefit of JTA‑004, supporting further investigation. Given its favorable safety profile and comparable efficacy, the JTA‑100/2 formulation was ultimately selected for future phase III studies. Larger, adequately powered randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of JTA‑004 and clarify its role as a minimally invasive viscosupplement option aimed at controlling pain and delaying knee joint replacement surgery.""}","{""conditions"": [""Knee Osteoarthritis"", ""Osteoarthritis"", ""Gonarthrosis""], ""keywords"": [""Knee osteoarthritis"", ""Osteoarthritis"", ""Gonarthrosis"", ""Intra-articular injections"", ""Viscosupplementation"", ""Hyaluronic acid"", ""Hylan G-F 20"", ""Synvisc-One"", ""Clonidine"", ""Human plasma"", ""Enhanced protein solution"", ""JTA-004"", ""Pain management"", ""Joint stiffness"", ""Physical function"", ""WOMAC"", ""SF-12"", ""Analgesics"", ""Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs"", ""Platelet-rich plasma""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""PHASE2"", ""PHASE3""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Two-stage, prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled phase II/III trial with four parallel groups (three JTA-004 formulations and one hyaluronic acid reference) receiving a single intra-articular injection."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": ""COHORT"", ""timePerspective"": ""PROSPECTIVE"", ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Double-blind: investigators who recruited, included, and assessed patients, as well as patients, were blinded to treatment assignment; only local pharmacists and independent physicians performing the injections were unblinded."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT"", ""INVESTIGATOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 164, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""JTA-100/2"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Single intra-articular injection into the target knee of JTA-004 formulation containing 100 μg clonidine and 20 mg hyaluronic acid in a 2 mL volume.

A total of 158 participants from 52 sites in 10 countries were randomized 1:1:1 to high‑dose deutetrabenazine, low‑dose deutetrabenazine, or placebo. Study medication was titrated over 4 weeks to a weight- and CYP2D6‑guided target dose, followed by a 4‑week maintenance period and 1‑week washout and follow‑up. The primary outcome was change from baseline to week 8 in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale–Total Tic Score (YGTSS‑TTS) for high‑dose deutetrabenazine vs placebo. Deutetrabenazine did not show a statistically significant benefit over placebo at week 8, although there were numerical improvements during the titration phase. Treatment‑emergent adverse events were generally mild or moderate, and no new safety signals, including for depression or suicidality, were identified."", ""detailedDescription"": ""The ARTISTS 2 (Alternatives for Reducing Tics in Tourette Syndrome 2) study was a multinational, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of fixed doses of deutetrabenazine in pediatric patients with Tourette syndrome. Deutetrabenazine is a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor approved in adults for chorea associated with Huntington disease and for tardive dyskinesia. Previous open-label data in adolescents with Tourette syndrome suggested clinically meaningful tic reduction with deutetrabenazine, prompting this confirmatory trial.\n\nChildren and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years, weighing at least 20 kg, who met DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for Tourette syndrome and had active, distressing or impairing tics (YGTSS-Total Tic Score ≥20 at screening and baseline) were eligible. Key exclusions included stereotypy related to autism spectrum disorder, clinically significant obsessive-compulsive disorder judged to be the primary cause of impairment, and clinically significant depression at baseline. Participants were recruited from 52 sites across 10 countries (United States, Argentina, Australia, Colombia, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Republic of Korea, and Ukraine).\n\nParticipants were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to high-dose deutetrabenazine (up to 48 mg/day), low-dose deutetrabenazine (up to 36 mg/day), or matching placebo. Randomization was stratified by age group (6–11 vs 12–16 years). Target doses were predefined based on baseline body weight category (≥40 kg, 30 to <40 kg, or 20 to <30 kg) and cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) impairment status (poor metabolizers or those receiving strong CYP2D6 inhibitors vs others). Doses were titrated over 4 weeks while balancing perceived efficacy and adverse events, then maintained for 4 additional weeks, followed by a 1‑week washout and 1‑week follow-up period.\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to week 8 in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale–Total Tic Score (YGTSS-TTS) for high-dose deutetrabenazine compared with placebo. The YGTSS is a semistructured, clinician-administered scale that rates motor and phonic tic number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference over the prior week; motor and vocal tic subscores (0–25 each) are summed to yield the TTS (0–50). Key secondary endpoints included: (1) change in Tourette Syndrome Clinical Global Impression (TS-CGI) score for high-dose deutetrabenazine vs placebo; (2) change in YGTSS-TTS for low-dose deutetrabenazine vs placebo; (3) change in TS-CGI for low-dose deutetrabenazine vs placebo; (4) change in Tourette Syndrome Patient Global Impression of Impact (TS-PGII) for each deutetrabenazine dose vs placebo; and (5) change in Child and Adolescent Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome–Quality of Life (CA-GTS-QOL) Activities of Daily Living (ADL) subscale score for each deutetrabenazine dose vs placebo. Exploratory efficacy analyses included the proportion of YGTSS responders (≥25% reduction in TTS from baseline) and changes in YGTSS motor and vocal tic subscores.\n\nThe primary analysis used a mixed model for repeated measures with change in YGTSS-TTS as the dependent variable and treatment group, week, and treatment-by-week interaction as fixed effects, adjusting for baseline YGTSS-TTS, region, and age group. Secondary continuous outcomes were analyzed similarly; TS-PGII and responder analyses used Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel methods. A hierarchical testing strategy controlled the family-wise type I error rate at 5%.\n\nAmong 193 screened participants, 158 were randomized (52 high-dose deutetrabenazine, 54 low-dose deutetrabenazine, 52 placebo), and 145 (91.8%) completed the study. The mean age was 11.7 years; 75% were boys. The mean time since Tourette syndrome diagnosis was 3.3 years, and mean baseline YGTSS-TTS was 33.8 points, indicating moderate to severe tics. Comorbid psychiatric conditions were common, particularly attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, and depression. Prior treatment for Tourette syndrome and use of psychotropic medications (e.g., antipsychotics, stimulants) were reported in a substantial proportion of participants.\n\nAt week 8, deutetrabenazine did not demonstrate a statistically significant advantage over placebo for the primary endpoint. The least-squares mean change from baseline in YGTSS-TTS was −7.8 points in the high-dose group and −7.0 points in the placebo group, yielding a least-squares mean difference of −0.8 points (95% CI, −3.9 to 2.3; P = .60; Cohen d, −0.11). None of the key secondary endpoints showed nominally significant differences between either deutetrabenazine dose and placebo. Notably, numerical improvements in YGTSS-TTS, TS-CGI, TS-PGII, and CA-GTS-QOL ADL scores favored deutetrabenazine over placebo at the end of the titration period (week 4), but the placebo group showed a steeper improvement between weeks 4 and 8, consistent with a strong placebo response during maintenance.\n\nResponder analyses similarly showed early signals favoring deutetrabenazine. In the high-dose group, the proportion of YGTSS-TTS responders (≥25% reduction) increased from 12% at week 2 to 42% at week 4 and 50% at week 8, compared with 20% and 39% at weeks 4 and 8, respectively, in the placebo group. The low-dose group had numerically higher responder rates than placebo at weeks 2 and 4, with convergence by week 8. Exploratory analyses of YGTSS motor and vocal tic subscores indicated numeric advantages for deutetrabenazine vs placebo during titration, particularly for motor tics.\n\nSafety was assessed via treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and standardized assessments for depression and suicidality (Children’s Depression Inventory 2 and the children’s Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale). Overall, TEAEs occurred in 65% of participants in the high-dose deutetrabenazine group, 44% in the low-dose group, and 49% in the placebo group. Most events were mild or moderate. There were no deaths and only one serious TEAE, which was deemed unrelated to study drug and occurred in a participant with ADHD following discontinuation of atomoxetine.\n\nCommon TEAEs more frequent with deutetrabenazine than placebo included headache, somnolence, nasopharyngitis, increased appetite, fatigue, and nausea. Rates of TEAEs within standardized MedDRA queries for depression and suicide/self-injury were low. Quantitative depression scores did not worsen over time in any group, and suicidal ideation was infrequent and similar between deutetrabenazine and placebo. No participants exhibited suicidal behavior during the trial. There were no clinically meaningful abnormalities in clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, electrocardiogram measures, or metabolic markers such as glucose and lipids. Mean weight gain over 8 weeks was modestly higher with deutetrabenazine than placebo but did not result in notable BMI category shifts.\n\nOverall, this fixed-dose phase 3 trial in children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint and showed no statistically significant benefits on key secondary measures when deutetrabenazine was compared with placebo over 8 weeks. However, deutetrabenazine was generally well tolerated, and no new or unexpected safety issues were observed compared with its established safety profile in adults with Huntington disease and tardive dyskinesia. The pattern of early improvement followed by strong placebo response highlights challenges in demonstrating drug–placebo differences in tic disorders and suggests that longer treatment durations, different dosing strategies, or alternative endpoints may be needed to fully characterize potential benefits of VMAT2 inhibition in pediatric Tourette syndrome.""}","{""conditions"": [""Tourette Syndrome"", ""Tic Disorders""], ""keywords"": [""Tourette Syndrome"", ""Tics"", ""Motor Tics"", ""Vocal Tics"", ""Phonic Tics"", ""Pediatric"", ""Adolescent"", ""Child"", ""Deutetrabenazine"", ""VMAT2 Inhibitors"", ""Vesicular Monoamine Transporter 2"", ""Yale Global Tic Severity Scale"", ""YGTSS"", ""Quality of Life"", ""Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder"", ""Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"", ""Depression"", ""Anxiety"", ""Randomized Controlled Trial"", ""Placebo-Controlled Trial""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""PHASE3""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose trial with three arms (high-dose deutetrabenazine, low-dose deutetrabenazine, placebo) over 8 weeks of treatment plus follow-up."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Double-blind design in which participants and investigators were blinded; placebo-controlled with matching placebo."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT"", ""INVESTIGATOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 158, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""High-dose deutetrabenazine"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Participants received high-dose deutetrabenazine, titrated over 4 weeks to a fixed target dose up to 48 mg/day based on body weight and CYP2D6 impairment status, followed by a 4-week maintenance period."", ""interventionNames"": [""Deutetrabenazine""]}, {""label"": ""Low-dose deutetrabenazine"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Participants received low-dose deutetrabenazine, titrated over 4 weeks to a fixed target dose up to 36 mg/day based on body weight and CYP2D6 impairment status, followed by a 4-week maintenance period."", ""interventionNames"": [""Deutetrabenazine""]}, {""label"": ""Placebo"", ""type"": ""PLACEBO_COMPARATOR"", ""description"": ""Participants received a matching placebo tablet, titrated over 4 weeks to a target schedule mirroring the active drug dosing based on body weight and CYP2D6 status, followed by a 4-week maintenance period."", ""interventionNames"": [""Placebo tablet""]}], ""interventions"": [{""type"": ""DRUG"", ""name"": ""Deutetrabenazine"", ""description"": ""Oral deutetrabenazine, a vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor.

Participants were performing less than 150 minutes per week of structured moderate‑intensity exercise at baseline.\n\nNinety patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of four groups for 16 weeks (48 supervised sessions, three times weekly): (1) Aerobic training (AT), consisting of individualized stationary cycle ergometry prescribed at 55% to >95% of peak oxygen consumption, with both continuous and interval formats and non‑linear periodized progression; (2) Resistance training (RT), consisting of 14 upper and lower extremity exercises, progressed over time to three sets of 6–18 repetitions at 50–85% of one‑repetition maximum, with individualized loading based on baseline and mid‑intervention strength testing; (3) Combination training (CT), incorporating both AT and RT within the same sessions following the individual AT and RT dosing schedules, with 30–90 minutes per session; and (4) Attention control (AC), consisting of supervised stretching sessions (12–20 positions held for 20–45 seconds) designed to control for social interaction and attention without providing a structured training stimulus.\n\nThe primary endpoint was change in CRF, quantified as VO2peak (mL O2·kg−1·min−1) measured by symptom‑limited cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) on a cycle ergometer with breath‑by‑breath gas analysis and 12‑lead ECG monitoring. To reduce learning effects, two baseline CPETs were performed, and the higher acceptable value was used. Secondary endpoints included other CPET parameters (e.g., ventilation, peak heart rate), maximal muscular strength (one‑repetition maximum for chest press, seated row, and leg press), body composition (lean mass and fat mass by DXA or air‑displacement plethysmography), and multiple patient‑reported outcomes (PROs), including quality of life [FACT‑L, FACT‑G], fatigue [FACIT‑Fatigue], pain [Brief Pain Inventory], and sleep quality [Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index]. Tolerability was assessed with a multidimensional framework adapted from drug trials, including relative dose intensity (RDI; ratio of completed to planned cumulative exercise dose), lost to follow‑up, session attendance, permanent discontinuation, treatment interruptions (≥3 consecutive missed sessions), dose modifications (changes in intensity or duration in ≥10% of sessions), pretreatment dose reductions, and early session terminations. Safety was evaluated by recording serious and non‑serious adverse events during CPET and all training sessions.\n\nThe study was powered originally for 160 participants but closed early at 90 due to slow accrual, rendering the results exploratory and hypothesis‑generating. In intention‑to‑treat analyses with adjustment for baseline values, age, body mass index, and comorbidities (coronary artery disease, COPD, hypertension), AT and CT produced statistically significant improvements in VO2peak versus attention control: AT increased VO2peak by 1.1 mL O2·kg−1·min−1 (95% CI 0.0 to 2.2; P = 0.04) and CT by 1.4 mL O2·kg−1·min−1 (95% CI 0.2 to 2.5; P = 0.02). RT did not differ from AC in VO2peak change (−0.1 mL O2·kg−1·min−1, 95% CI −1.2 to 1.0; P = 0.88). About half of participants in AT and CT achieved VO2peak gains greater than the technical error threshold (≥1.12 mL O2·kg−1·min−1), compared with 13% in RT and AC.\n\nFor secondary outcomes, AT improved several other cardiopulmonary responses (e.g., ventilation, peak heart rate) compared with attention control. RT, and to a similar extent CT, produced significant gains in upper and lower extremity maximal strength and favorable trends in body composition (increased lean mass and decreased fat mass) compared with AC. However, none of the exercise regimens significantly improved PROs relative to stretching attention control, suggesting that social interaction and structured contact may account for much of the PRO benefit seen in prior exercise trials that used usual‑care controls.\n\nTolerability differed by modality. Relative dose intensity was significantly lower in RT and CT compared with AT (RT −24%, CT −30% versus AT), indicating more frequent modifications, interruptions, or incomplete sessions in RT‑containing regimens. While lost‑to‑follow‑up and average attendance were acceptable and similar across arms, permanent discontinuations and treatment interruptions were more common in RT and CT. Arthralgia was the most frequent reason for dose modification and occurred far more often in RT‑containing regimens (65% in RT and 60% in CT) than in AT and AC (13% each). No serious adverse events occurred during CPET or training sessions, indicating that all regimens were safe under close supervision.\n\nThe investigators concluded that, among lung cancer survivors with markedly reduced CRF, both aerobic training alone and combination training can produce modest but significant improvements in VO2peak compared with a stretching attention control. Single‑modality resistance training does not enhance CRF but does improve strength and body composition and may be appropriate for patients in whom muscle mass or strength is the primary clinical concern (e.g., those at risk for cancer‑related cachexia or sarcopenia). Considering efficacy, time commitment, and tolerability metrics such as relative dose intensity and adverse events, the authors suggest that aerobic training offers the most favorable benefit‑to‑tolerability ratio for targeting impaired cardiorespiratory fitness in this post‑treatment lung cancer population. The findings also highlight substantial inter‑individual variability in CRF response and support future work on more personalized exercise prescriptions and on remote or telemedicine‑based delivery models to improve feasibility and accrual in similar trials.""}","{""conditions"": [""Lung Neoplasms"", ""Lung Cancer"", ""Cardiorespiratory Fitness"", ""Exercise Therapy""], ""keywords"": [""Lung Neoplasms"", ""Lung Cancer"", ""Survivors"", ""Cardiorespiratory Fitness"", ""Peak Oxygen Consumption"", ""VO2peak"", ""Exercise Therapy"", ""Aerobic Exercise"", ""Aerobic Training"", ""Resistance Training"", ""Strength Training"", ""Combined Modality Therapy"", ""Concurrent Training"", ""Body Composition"", ""Muscle Strength"", ""Quality of Life"", ""Fatigue"", ""Cancer Survivorship"", ""Pulmonary Rehabilitation"", ""Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""FACTORIAL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Parallel-group factorial randomized controlled trial with four arms: aerobic training, resistance training, combination training (aerobic plus resistance), and stretching attention control, with 1:1:1:1 allocation."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""SINGLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Participants and exercise physiologists were aware of group allocation, but study investigators (including those analyzing data) and participants were blinded to pre-randomization and post-intervention test results; investigators were also stated to be blinded to treatment allocation."", ""whoMasked"": [""INVESTIGATOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 90, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Aerobic Training (AT)"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Participants received supervised aerobic training consisting of stationary cycle ergometry three times per week for 16 consecutive weeks (total 48 sessions).

Investigators compared participants (enrolled 2018–2019) to propensity-matched historical controls (2015–2017) from the same health system to assess feasibility, short‑term safety (30- and 90-day readmissions), and effectiveness in improving cardiac rehabilitation (CR) enrollment and early outpatient cardiology follow-up. The study found high and durable engagement across demographic and risk-factor groups, no increase in short-term readmissions, and substantially higher CR enrollment and 1‑month cardiology follow-up among app users."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This study was an open-label, single-arm, multicenter clinical trial conducted at two academic hospitals (Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital) within a single health system. The trial evaluated the feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of a smartphone app-based digital health platform for patients hospitalized for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD), including acute myocardial infarction (MI) and non-MI CAD.\n\nPatients aged initially 21–70 years (later expanded to 21–85 years) who spoke English, owned a smartphone or tablet, and had undergone PCI were approached for enrollment between February 2018 and May 2019. Exclusions included recent substance or alcohol abuse, in-hospital acute MI, pregnancy, dementia or cognitive delay, and incarceration. The intervention consisted of onboarding patients to a customized mobile health platform (Wellframe) at or shortly after hospital discharge. The app included a personalized daily health checklist, educational content, interactive surveys, medication and step tracking, goal-setting around physical activity, reminders, and secure messaging with third‑party (non‑clinician) health coaches, supported by a clinician-facing dashboard. Accounts remained active for 90 days. \n\nTo evaluate the intervention, the investigators assembled a 1:3 propensity-matched historical control cohort from the same two hospitals (January 2015–December 2017). Historical controls met the same clinical eligibility criteria, except that smartphone/tablet ownership information was not available. Matching variables included age, sex, PCI indication (MI vs symptomatic non-MI CAD), diabetes mellitus type 2, primary care provider within the health system, insurance type, state of residence, and PCI site. Balance was checked with standardized mean differences. All outcomes for both intervention and control groups were adjudicated via manual chart review within the integrated electronic health record.\n\nThe primary safety endpoint was 30-day all-cause hospital readmission. Secondary safety and utilization endpoints included 90-day all-cause readmission and 30- and 90-day cardiovascular readmission. Effectiveness endpoints focused on processes of care: 90-day enrollment in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) at a health-system facility and 1‑month follow-up with a system cardiologist. Feasibility was measured by the proportion of eligible patients who enrolled and by multiple engagement metrics, such as content viewing, survey completion, self-reported physical activity goal completion, medication reminder use, and messaging patterns with health coaches.\n\nA total of 1994 PCI patients were screened; 1026 were ineligible (most commonly due to having elective PCI after a prespecified cap, advanced age before inclusion criteria were expanded, or medical complexity). Of 968 eligible patients, 324 were approached and 118 (36.4%) consented and enrolled. Participants had a mean age of 62.5 years, 73.7% were male, 33.9% had type 2 diabetes, 57.6% underwent PCI for MI, and 50.0% had known CAD. Demographics and comorbidities were similar between the intervention group (n=118) and historical controls (n=343) after matching.\n\nEngagement with the app was high and durable over 90 days. At 30 and 90 days, the majority of users opened at least half of the educational content, completed at least half of the surveys, and reported meeting physical activity goals on at least half of days. Weekly engagement—defined as having at least one day per week with any task completed—was 80.5% at 30 days and 66.9% at 90 days. Patients set up multiple daily medication reminders, and bidirectional messaging between participants and health coaches was robust, with strong correlation between messages sent by patients and messages sent by coaches. Importantly, engagement metrics showed no significant association with age, sex, PCI indication, or major cardiovascular risk factors, suggesting broadly similar uptake across demographic and clinical subgroups.\n\nIn terms of clinical and utilization outcomes, the app did not increase short-term readmissions. All-cause readmission rates at 30 and 90 days were similar between the intervention and historical control groups, as were cardiovascular-specific readmission rates. However, the intervention was associated with a substantially higher rate of 90-day CR enrollment at system facilities (approximately 30% vs 16% in controls), corresponding to roughly one additional CR enrollment for every eight app users. Among those who enrolled in CR, completion rates were numerically higher in the intervention group, though the difference did not reach statistical significance. The app group also had roughly double the rate of 1‑month cardiology follow-up within the health system compared with controls, without differences in the timing of the first follow-up visit when it occurred.\n\nThe investigators concluded that deploying a smartphone app with third-party health coaches at the time of hospital discharge after PCI is feasible, achieves high patient engagement across different demographic and risk-factor profiles, and appears safe with respect to short-term readmissions. The intervention successfully improved key care-transition processes, particularly CR enrollment and early outpatient cardiology follow-up. Limitations include its non-randomized design, reliance on a historical control cohort, modest sample size, short follow-up duration, and potential selection bias related to smartphone ownership and willingness to enroll. Larger, prospective, randomized controlled trials are recommended to determine whether such digital health interventions can improve long-term cardiovascular outcomes and to better understand their impact on health equity and the digital divide.""}","{""conditions"": [""Coronary Artery Disease"", ""Myocardial Infarction"", ""Acute Coronary Syndrome"", ""Percutaneous Coronary Intervention"", ""Cardiac Rehabilitation"", ""Secondary Prevention"", ""Transitional Care, Hospital to Home""], ""keywords"": [""Coronary Artery Disease"", ""Myocardial Infarction"", ""Acute Coronary Syndrome"", ""Percutaneous Coronary Intervention"", ""Cardiac Rehabilitation"", ""Secondary Prevention"", ""Mobile Health"", ""mHealth"", ""Smartphone Applications"", ""Telemedicine"", ""Digital Health"", ""Health Coaching"", ""Hospital Readmission"", ""Patient Engagement"", ""Care Transitions""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""NON_RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""SINGLE_GROUP"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Open-label, single-arm pilot trial of a customized smartphone app with live health coaches for patients post-PCI, conducted at two academic medical centers and compared against 1:3 propensity-matched historical controls."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH"", ""observationalModel"": ""COHORT"", ""timePerspective"": ""RETROSPECTIVE"", ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Open-label study with no blinding; intervention participants and investigators were aware of app use, and outcomes were compared with unblinded historical controls via manual chart review."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 118, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Smartphone App Intervention"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Single-arm intervention group consisting of patients aged 21–85 years undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for symptomatic coronary artery disease or acute myocardial infarction at two academic centers, who owned a smartphone or tablet and were onboarded to a customized mobile health platform within 48 hours of hospital discharge.

Consecutive patients with imaging- and clinically-confirmed sNA-ICAO (24 hours to 6 months from onset) are treated either with SMT alone or with ER plus SMT and followed for 2 years. The main outcome is the occurrence of any stroke during follow-up, with additional assessments of mortality, disability, neurologic deficits, and cognitive function."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This study is a multicenter, prospective registry, non-randomized cohort trial conducted at 15 centers across China to investigate the technical feasibility and safety of endovascular recanalization (ER) for symptomatic non-acute intracranial artery occlusion (sNA-ICAO). sNA-ICAO refers to intracranial large artery occlusion in patients who remain symptomatic between 24 hours and 6 months after onset, despite standard medical therapy (SMT), and is associated with high morbidity and a high risk of recurrent ischemic events.\n\nEligible patients are identified by clinical evaluation and vascular imaging (MRA, CTA, or DSA) confirming sNA-ICAO. From January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2022, consecutive patients are enrolled and assigned to one of two cohorts based on clinical judgment and patient/family preference: (1) SMT alone or (2) ER plus SMT. Both cohorts share the same inclusion/exclusion criteria and outcome measures. SMT includes dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel for 90 days followed by long-term single antiplatelet therapy, as well as intensive management of vascular risk factors such as blood pressure and LDL cholesterol, lifestyle counseling, and coordination of care for comorbidities.\n\nFor ER, patients receive dual antiplatelet therapy before the procedure. Under general anesthesia, experienced interventional neuroradiologists perform endovascular recanalization using a guiding catheter, microcatheter, and micro guidewire to cross the occluded segment, followed by balloon angioplasty and, when needed, stent implantation to restore vessel patency. Successful revascularization is defined as modified TICI grade 2b or 3 with residual stenosis <50%. For internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (MCA M1) occlusions, ipsilateral hypoperfusion is confirmed by CT or MR perfusion imaging; perfusion data may be processed by the RAPID system using DEFUSE 3 criteria.\n\nAll patients undergo standardized data collection at baseline, including demographics, vascular risk factors, stroke history and symptoms, morphology of the occlusion, time from occlusion and last symptoms to recanalization (for ER patients), functional status (modified Rankin Scale [mRS]), neurological deficits (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS]), and, for anterior circulation lesions, cognitive testing. Cognitive assessment covers memory, executive function, processing speed, and attention/working memory using components of the Chinese version of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale and other tests (animal naming, letter fluency, digit span).\n\nPatients are followed at 30 days, 3 months, 8 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months after enrollment. The primary endpoint is any stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) occurring from enrollment to 2 years. Secondary outcomes include all-cause mortality, mRS score, NIHSS score, and longitudinal cognitive function. Stroke is defined using World Health Organization criteria. Major stroke is defined as an NIHSS score ≥6 at least 30 days after onset, and mild stroke as an NIHSS deterioration of ≤4 points with corresponding diffusion-weighted MRI changes or as adjudicated by a stroke committee. All clinical events are adjudicated by an independent committee blinded to treatment allocation.\n\nThe planned sample size is 160 patients in the ER plus SMT group and 320 in the SMT-alone group (1:2 allocation), based on an expected 2-year ipsilateral ischemic stroke rate of approximately 10% for ER plus SMT and 20% for SMT alone, with 80% power and a 5% two-sided alpha, accounting for non-participation and dropout. Preprocedural complication rates exceeding 15% (e.g., arterial dissection, perforation, thrombus migration, subacute stent thrombosis, hemorrhage, or death) are set as safety termination criteria.\n\nStatistical analyses include descriptive statistics and comparative tests (chi-square, t-test, Mann–Whitney U). Cox proportional hazards models will estimate the risk of mortality and ischemic events. Multivariable models will adjust for age, sex, baseline NIHSS and mRS, baseline cognitive function, medical history, prior ischemic stroke, time from last neurologic event, and occlusion site. Propensity score matching (1:1 nearest neighbor, caliper 0.2 of the propensity score) will be used in sensitivity analyses to address treatment-selection bias, matching on age, baseline neurologic and functional status, cognitive function, occlusion location, and medical history.\n\nData management is centralized under a Scientific Committee, with secure, anonymized, web-based data entry and site-specific access. The study adheres to the Declaration of Helsinki, and all participants provide written informed consent. Ethics approval was obtained from the Beijing Tiantan Hospital ethics committee and institutional review boards of all participating centers. The results are intended to provide higher-level evidence on the role of ER plus SMT versus SMT alone in preventing recurrent stroke and improving functional and cognitive outcomes in patients with sNA-ICAO.""}","{""conditions"": [""Intracranial Arterial Occlusive Diseases"", ""Cerebral Artery Occlusion"", ""Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion"", ""Internal Carotid Artery Occlusion"", ""Ischemic Stroke"", ""Cerebrovascular Disorders""], ""keywords"": [""symptomatic non-acute intracranial artery occlusion"", ""sNA-ICAO"", ""intracranial large artery occlusion"", ""endovascular recanalization"", ""ER"", ""standard medical therapy"", ""SMT"", ""ischemic stroke recurrence"", ""cerebral ischemia"", ""middle cerebral artery"", ""internal carotid artery"", ""perfusion imaging"", ""CT perfusion"", ""MR perfusion"", ""RAPID software"", ""DEFUSE 3 criteria"", ""dual antiplatelet therapy"", ""balloon angioplasty"", ""intracranial stent"", ""modified TICI"", ""vascular cognitive impairment""]}","{""studyType"": ""OBSERVATIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": true, ""targetDuration"": ""P2Y"", ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""NON_RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Multicenter, prospective, non-randomized cohort registry in which consecutive patients with symptomatic non-acute intracranial artery occlusion receive either standard medical therapy alone or endovascular recanalization plus standard medical therapy and are followed in parallel."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": ""COHORT"", ""timePerspective"": ""PROSPECTIVE"", ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""SINGLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Clinical outcomes (including stroke events) are determined by an adjudication committee that is unaware of the trial design and group assignments; treating clinicians and participants are not masked."", ""whoMasked"": [""OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 480, ""type"": ""ESTIMATED""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Endovascular Recanalization plus Standard Medical Therapy"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Patients with symptomatic non-acute intracranial artery occlusion (sNA-ICAO) treated with endovascular recanalization (ER) in addition to standard medical therapy (SMT).

Participants aged 18 and older with a current mental health diagnosis were randomized 2:1 to either MoST-MH or enhanced usual care (eUC). MoST-MH delivered periodic text message check-ins about emotional health and, when needed, web-based check-ins assessing stressors, negative impacts, and self-efficacy, followed by tailored self-care support messages and links to psychoeducational videos. Both groups received access to the same video library and completed monthly self-report measures for 3 months. The main aims were to assess engagement and usability of MoST-MH and to explore its effects on mental health self-efficacy, symptom severity, and mental health service use. The study found high engagement and usability for MoST-MH and a modest reduction in depressive symptoms compared to eUC, but no significant effects on self-efficacy or mental health care use."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This study was a pilot randomized controlled trial testing the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of the Mobile Support Tool for Mental Health (MoST-MH) in young adults transitioning to college who had current mental health disorders or recent mental health care. The transition to college is a period of heightened academic, financial, and interpersonal stress, often coinciding with transitions from pediatric to adult health services and barriers to accessing in-person mental health care. Digital mental health interventions can help, but many existing tools target single disorders, require human support, and have low long-term engagement.\n\nMoST-MH is a fully automated, transdiagnostic ecological momentary intervention designed by a multidisciplinary team with input from a college student ambassador. It primarily uses SMS text messaging, supplemented by brief web-based check-ins, to provide tailored support for mental health self-management. After randomization, participants in the MoST-MH arm initiated the program by texting a keyword to a study number. Over 3 months, they received periodic text-based mental health check-ins asking them to rate their emotional health over the past week. If they reported \""excellent,\"" \""very good,\"" or \""good\"" emotional health, they received positive feedback and a link to a psychoeducational video library focused on mental health and college life. If they reported \""fair\"" or \""poor\"" emotional health, they were sent a link to a web-based check-in.\n\nThe web-based check-ins presented a checklist of common stressors (for example, school or finances) and negative effects (such as feeling worn out or low motivation) and asked a self-efficacy question about the participant's confidence in managing these stressors and their impacts. If self-efficacy was rated as high, participants received encouraging feedback and a link to the video library, and the system stepped down to a lower check-in frequency (about monthly). If self-efficacy was rated as low, MoST-MH provided skills-based support messages grounded in positive psychology, cognitive behavioral therapy, and dialectical behavior therapy, plus links to the video library. It also asked permission to check in again the following week. Over time, the system compared current and previous reports of stressors and negative impacts, tailoring feedback around improvements or ongoing difficulties. If poor mental health and low self-efficacy were reported for two consecutive weeks, MoST-MH encouraged participants to seek formal mental health care and provided resource links.\n\nParticipants in the control arm (enhanced usual care, eUC) received access to the same psychoeducational video library but did not receive any text message or web-based mental health check-ins. All participants, regardless of arm, were asked to complete monthly web-based assessments for 3 months, including the Mental Health Self-Efficacy Scale (MHSES), the College Counseling Center Assessment of Psychological Symptoms (CCAPS) measuring multiple symptom domains (depression, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, academic distress, eating concerns, family distress, hostility, and substance use), and the Client Service Receipt Inventory for Mental Health (C-SRI) to capture mental health service utilization. At 3 months, MoST-MH participants also completed the Post-Study System Usability Scale (PSSUQ). Assessments were completed on personal devices, with reminder texts to promote completion. Participants could earn up to US$100 for completing the assessment batteries; there was no payment for interacting with the MoST-MH system itself.\n\nThe trial enrolled 52 participants (mean age ≥18 years) from a primary care clinic and a mental health clinic. Most participants were female and White, and most planned to attend a 4-year college with varied living situations. Randomization was stratified by recruitment site with a 2:1 allocation to MoST-MH (n=34) versus eUC (n=18). Investigators and outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation. Follow-up completion was high, with 94% completing 1-month, 90% 2-month, and 87% 3-month assessments. Because more White participants and those planning to live on campus were in the MoST-MH arm, models controlled for sex, race, and college living plans. Analyses used generalized estimating equations for repeated measures and included both completer analyses and sensitivity intention-to-treat analyses with multiple imputation.\n\nEngagement with MoST-MH was high over the 3-month period. Participants received a median of 5 text check-in prompts (range 3–10) and responded to 100% of these queries. Among the 21 participants who ever reported poor emotional health, the system sent a median of 2 web-based check-in prompts (range 1–8); 78% (43/55) of these web check-ins were completed. No participant withdrew from the program via the \""Quit\"" command. The median number of stressors per check-in was 2 and the median number of negative effects was 3. The most commonly reported stressors involved school and finances, and frequent negative effects included feeling worn out and low motivation. Self-efficacy for managing stressors and their impact was low in the majority of episodes (91%), and lower baseline generalized anxiety scores were associated with higher self-efficacy. Demographic factors were not significantly associated with engagement or self-efficacy.\n\nUsability of MoST-MH was rated as high. The mean overall PSSUQ score at 3 months was 2.0 (on a 1–7 scale, with lower scores indicating better usability). Subscale scores were similarly favorable for system usefulness, information quality, and interface quality. Usability ratings did not vary significantly by sex, race, college living situation, or baseline mental health scores.\n\nFor clinical outcomes, the investigators examined trajectories of mental health self-efficacy and symptom severity. Mental health self-efficacy scores on the MHSES did not significantly change over time in either arm, and there were no significant time-by-treatment interactions. In contrast, CCAPS symptom scores showed broader reductions in the MoST-MH arm than in eUC, particularly for depression. In MoST-MH participants, symptom severity declined over 3 months across all subscales except substance use, whereas eUC participants showed reductions in generalized anxiety, family distress, and hostility only. GEE models indicated a significant overall time effect for depression at 1 month and a significant time-by-treatment interaction at 3 months, with MoST-MH associated with lower depression scores than eUC (effect size d≈0.36). However, in sensitivity analyses using multiple imputation for missing CCAPS data, treatment effects were no longer statistically significant, consistent with the pilot nature and limited power of the study.\n\nUse of formal mental health services was common at baseline and remained relatively stable across both arms, with a slight decline over time. Before enrollment, more than half of participants in each arm had received some form of mental health care. During the 3-month follow-up, about half of participants in each group reported receiving mental health services in any given month. There were no significant differences between MoST-MH and eUC in overall service utilization or in specific modalities (outpatient, inpatient, or primary care for mental health).\n\nThe authors concluded that MoST-MH is a feasible, highly usable, and engaging intervention that may help reduce depressive symptoms in college-bound young adults with pre-existing mental health conditions. Its fully automated, transdiagnostic design and reliance on widely available SMS and web technologies suggest strong potential for scalable implementation. Key limitations include the small, predominantly female and White sample; the short 3-month follow-up; conduct during the COVID-19 pandemic with atypical college experiences; and lack of diagnostic and treatment subtype details. The study was not powered to detect definitive differences in clinical outcomes, and mechanisms of effect (such as changes in self-efficacy or help-seeking behavior) remain unclear. The authors recommend larger, more diverse trials with longer follow-up to further test the effectiveness, mechanisms, and implementation potential of MoST-MH.""}","{""conditions"": [""Depressive Disorder"", ""Anxiety Disorders"", ""Stress, Psychological"", ""Mental Disorders"", ""Adjustment Disorders""], ""keywords"": [""college students"", ""young adult"", ""mental health"", ""depression"", ""anxiety"", ""psychological stress"", ""self-management"", ""self-efficacy"", ""ecological momentary intervention"", ""mobile health"", ""mHealth"", ""text messaging"", ""digital mental health intervention"", ""transition to college""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Pilot randomized parallel-group trial with participants allocated 2:1 to MoST-MH versus enhanced usual care."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Study investigators and outcome assessors were blinded to allocation to treatment arms."", ""whoMasked"": [""INVESTIGATOR"", ""OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 52, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""MoST-MH"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Participants received the Mobile Support Tool for Mental Health (MoST-MH), an automated, transdiagnostic digital mental health support program delivered primarily via text messaging with web-based follow-up check-ins.

Adults with plaque psoriasis first received open‑label ustekinumab; those who responded well at week 12 were randomized either to continue ustekinumab or to switch to abatacept while ustekinumab was withdrawn. The main question was whether abatacept could maintain the clinical benefits and suppress the psoriasis‑related molecular signature in skin and blood, thereby preventing or delaying relapse. The study found that abatacept did not prevent psoriasis relapse and did not maintain suppression of the pathogenic IL‑23‑mediated psoriasis molecular pathways after ustekinumab withdrawal."", ""detailedDescription"": ""The Psoriasis Treatment with Abatacept and Ustekinumab: a Study of Efficacy (PAUSE) trial was a multicenter, parallel‑design, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled randomized clinical trial conducted at 10 sites in the United States and Canada. The trial enrolled adults aged 18 to 65 years with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, defined by a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) of at least 12 and body surface area involvement of at least 10%. Key exclusion criteria included prior exposure to ustekinumab or other IL‑12/IL‑23‑targeting agents, moderate to severe psoriatic arthritis, and comorbidities that increased risk.\n\nThe study was designed to test the hypothesis that blocking T‑cell costimulatory signaling via CD28‑CD80/CD86 with abatacept (CTLA4‑Ig) would induce or maintain T‑cell tolerance in resolving psoriasis lesions after ustekinumab induction, thereby preventing or delaying psoriasis relapse. T‑cell activation requires both antigen‑specific T‑cell receptor engagement and costimulatory signals; in the absence of CD28‑mediated costimulation, T‑cell tolerance may result. Abatacept competes with CD28 for binding to CD80/CD86 on antigen‑presenting cells, inhibiting T‑cell activation. Earlier phase studies suggested clinical benefit of abatacept in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, motivating this sequential therapy approach.\n\nThe trial comprised three phases: (1) a lead‑in phase (weeks 0–12), (2) a randomized treatment phase (weeks 12–40), and (3) an observation phase (weeks 40–88). During the lead‑in phase, 108 participants received subcutaneous ustekinumab at weeks 0 and 4 (45 mg if body weight ≤100 kg, 90 mg if >100 kg). At week 12, response to ustekinumab was assessed; 91 participants (84.3%) who achieved at least 75% improvement from baseline PASI (PASI 75) were randomized 1:1 using a stratified, permuted‑block design (stratified by baseline PASI 12–20 vs >20).\n\nRandomized participants either continued ustekinumab (ustekinumab group) or were switched to abatacept (abatacept group). The abatacept group received subcutaneous abatacept 125 mg weekly from weeks 12 to 39 and ustekinumab placebo at weeks 16 and 28. The ustekinumab group received active ustekinumab at weeks 16 and 28 and abatacept placebo weekly from weeks 12 to 39. All systemic biologic, immunosuppressive, and topical psoriasis therapies outside protocol drugs were prohibited. Study drug administration ended at week 39; participants were then followed for relapse through week 88. PASI was measured every 4 weeks.\n\nThe primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with psoriasis relapse between weeks 12 and 88. Psoriasis relapse was defined as loss of at least 50% of the original PASI improvement observed at week 12 versus baseline. Secondary endpoints included time to relapse, proportion relapsing between weeks 12 and 40, and safety (treatment‑emergent and serious adverse events). The primary analysis was performed in the intention‑to‑treat (ITT) population (all randomized participants). Logistic regression with treatment group as the main factor and baseline PASI stratum plus disease duration as covariates was used for the primary comparison. Participants who discontinued early because of relapse or worsening psoriasis were classified as having relapsed. Other early discontinuations were classified as dropouts; the primary analysis treated all dropouts as relapsed, with sensitivity analyses treating dropouts as non‑relapsed or excluding them.\n\nThe trial also incorporated extensive mechanistic endpoints. Paired lesional and nonlesional skin biopsies were obtained at baseline (week 0) and from the same lesion at week 12 and subsequently at week 24 (optional), week 40, and at the final visit. RNA was extracted and analyzed via RNA sequencing to characterize the psoriasis disease transcriptome, focusing on an IL‑23– and IL‑17A‑mediated psoriasis molecular signature, including keratinocyte‑induced genes downstream of IL‑17 receptor signaling. Differentially expressed genes were defined by fold change ≥1.5 and false discovery rate <0.05. In addition, serum cytokines (including IL‑17A, IL‑22, IL‑19, interferon‑γ, IL‑2, IL‑10, IL‑6, tumor necrosis factor, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin) were quantified using an ultrasensitive multiplex immunoassay; serum IL‑19 was assayed separately.\n\nOf the 91 randomized participants, 45 were assigned to abatacept and 46 to continued ustekinumab. The primary endpoint was not met. Between weeks 12 and 88, psoriasis relapse occurred in 41 of 45 participants (91.1%) in the abatacept group and 40 of 46 (87.0%) in the ustekinumab group (P = .41). A larger proportion in the abatacept group relapsed between weeks 12 and 40 (55.6% vs 30.4%; P = .01). The median time to relapse from enrollment was shorter with abatacept (40 weeks; 95% CI, 40–52) than with continued ustekinumab (60 weeks; 95% CI, 56–68), but when measured from the last ustekinumab dose, time to relapse was similar between groups (36 vs 32 weeks). Longer time to relapse was associated with achieving PASI 90 or greater response, but not with baseline weight or PASI. Adverse event frequencies and rates, including serious events, were similar between groups.\n\nTranscriptomic analysis at baseline identified 3,988 differentially expressed genes in lesional versus nonlesional skin, defining the disease transcriptome. After 12 weeks of ustekinumab induction, 2,705 genes were significantly modulated in resolving lesions versus baseline lesions, 2,553 of which belonged to the disease transcriptome. Ustekinumab effectively downregulated IL‑23‑mediated genes, including IL‑17A and key psoriasis molecular signature genes expressed by keratinocytes, as well as transcripts related to the CD28‑CD80/CD86 pathway (CD80, CD28, ICOS, CTLA‑4). Serum levels of IL‑17A, IL‑22, and IL‑19 were significantly reduced at week 12, along with modest reductions in interferon‑γ, IL‑2, IL‑10, IL‑6, tumor necrosis factor, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin.\n\nIn participants who completed blinded treatment through week 39, continued ustekinumab maintained suppression of the psoriasis molecular signature in resolving lesions, whereas switching to abatacept did not. The weighted mean expression (eigengene) of the psoriasis molecular signature and IL‑17A transcripts increased in the abatacept group by weeks 24 and 40, correlating with the earlier clinical relapse. Similarly, suppression of serum IL‑19 achieved at week 12 was not maintained at week 40 in the abatacept group, in contrast to the ustekinumab group. Serum IL‑17A and IL‑22 levels were comparable between groups over time, differing from the patterns seen at the transcript level in skin.\n\nAdditional mechanistic analyses focused on cytokines associated with regulatory T cells (Tregs). Because the CD28 costimulatory pathway is important for Treg development and maintenance, and abatacept is known to reduce circulating effector Tregs and follicular helper T cells, investigators examined IL‑2 and IL‑10. In the PAUSE cohort, serum IL‑10 and IL‑2 levels were significantly reduced at weeks 24 and 40 in the abatacept group versus the ustekinumab group. This pattern was consistent with an independent placebo‑controlled abatacept trial in multiple sclerosis (ACCLAIM), supporting the conclusion that abatacept decreases serum cytokines associated with Tregs in both settings. IL‑10 and IL‑2 transcripts in lesional skin showed a downward trend with abatacept but did not differ significantly between treatment groups.\n\nOverall, the study demonstrated that sequential costimulatory blockade with abatacept after ustekinumab‑induced remission did not prevent psoriasis relapse and did not sustain suppression of the pathogenic IL‑23‑mediated psoriasis molecular signature in skin. The findings suggest that relapse in plaque psoriasis may be driven by mechanisms that are at least partly independent of CD28‑CD80/CD86 signaling, potentially involving tissue‑resident memory T cells capable of producing IL‑17A and IL‑22 via CD28‑independent pathways. These data imply that abatacept is not effective for maintaining cutaneous remission after ustekinumab withdrawal and may not be suitable as a strategy to concurrently control skin lesions in patients with psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis when ustekinumab is discontinued. Limitations include the chosen abatacept dose and timing relative to ustekinumab induction, constraints on the number and timing of skin and blood samples, and the absence of a double‑placebo arm to disentangle effects of abatacept from natural disease course after ustekinumab withdrawal.""}","{""conditions"": [""Psoriasis"", ""Plaque Psoriasis"", ""Psoriasis Vulgaris""], ""keywords"": [""Psoriasis"", ""Plaque psoriasis"", ""Psoriasis vulgaris"", ""Ustekinumab"", ""Abatacept"", ""CTLA4-Ig"", ""CD28-CD80/CD86 costimulatory signaling"", ""T-cell activation"", ""Interleukin-23"", ""IL-23"", ""Interleukin-17"", ""IL-17A"", ""Interleukin-22"", ""IL-22"", ""Interleukin-19"", ""IL-19"", ""Psoriasis molecular signature"", ""Transcriptome"", ""RNA sequencing"", ""Serum cytokines"", ""Regulatory T cells"", ""Tissue-resident memory T cells"", ""Randomized controlled trial"", ""Biologic therapy"", ""Disease relapse"", ""Costimulatory blockade""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Multicenter parallel-design, placebo-controlled trial: all participants received open-label ustekinumab lead-in; week-12 responders (PASI ≥75) were randomized 1:1 to continue ustekinumab or switch to abatacept, with matching placebos."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Double-blind randomized phase: participants and site clinical personnel were blinded by use of abatacept vs abatacept placebo and ustekinumab vs ustekinumab placebo; site pharmacists were unblinded for preparation only."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT"", ""CARE_PROVIDER"", ""INVESTIGATOR"", ""OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 91, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Lead-in Ustekinumab (Open-label)"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""All enrolled adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis received open-label subcutaneous ustekinumab as an induction (lead-in) phase.

Participants received subcutaneous bepirovirsen (150 mg or 300 mg) or placebo twice weekly for 2 weeks then once weekly for 2 weeks, followed by 26 weeks of follow‑up. The main goal was to assess safety and tolerability; a key secondary goal was to measure antiviral activity, particularly change in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) levels. Bepirovirsen produced dose‑dependent reductions in HBsAg and HBV DNA, with significant effects at 300 mg, and a generally favorable safety profile, though transient alanine aminotransferase (ALT) flares were observed and appeared related to antiviral activity."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This first‑in‑human, phase 2, double‑blind, randomized, placebo‑controlled, dose‑escalation trial (NCT02981602; ISIS 505358‑CS3; GSK study 205695) investigated the safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of bepirovirsen (GSK3228836) in adults with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Bepirovirsen is a 2′‑O‑methoxyethyl (2′‑MOE) gapmer antisense oligonucleotide with phosphorothioate linkages that binds a conserved sequence present in all HBV mRNAs and pregenomic RNA, leading to RNase H–mediated cleavage, and reductions in HBV RNA, HBV DNA, and viral proteins, including hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).\n\nEligible participants had chronic HBV infection for at least 6 months and serum HBsAg ≥50 IU/mL; both hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)–positive and HBeAg‑negative patients were included. Treatment‑naïve participants required HBV DNA ≥2×10³ IU/mL; on‑NA participants had HBV DNA below the lower limit of quantitation while on stable tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or entecavir for ≥12 months.\n\nA total of 31 patients with CHB were enrolled at centers in Hong Kong and the Republic of Korea: 24 treatment‑naïve (randomized to placebo, bepirovirsen 150 mg, or bepirovirsen 300 mg) and 7 on stable NA therapy (randomized to placebo or bepirovirsen 300 mg). Study drug was administered subcutaneously six times over 4 weeks: twice weekly during weeks 1 and 2 (days 1, 4, 8, 11) and once weekly during weeks 3 and 4 (days 15 and 22). Treatment‑naïve patients then initiated NA therapy on day 29; on‑NA patients continued their background NA. All participants were followed through day 211 (week 31).\n\nThe primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability, including adverse events (AEs), laboratory parameters (notably liver enzymes, C‑reactive protein, coagulation tests), vital signs, ECGs, and physical examinations. Secondary objectives included evaluation of antiviral activity: changes from baseline to day 29 and week 31 in serum HBsAg, plasma HBV DNA, and serum HBeAg (in HBeAg‑positive patients), as well as the proportion of patients achieving HBsAg or HBeAg loss. Exploratory endpoints included HBV RNA, hepatitis B core‑related antigen (HBcrAg), and seroconversion to anti‑HBs or anti‑HBe antibodies.\n\nBepirovirsen was generally well tolerated. The most common treatment‑emergent adverse events were mild to moderate injection‑site reactions (erythema, swelling, pruritus, bruising, pain) and pyrexia. Transient elevations in C‑reactive protein were observed after initial dosing, consistent with known class effects of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, without consistent associated symptoms. Transient, modest prolongations of activated partial thromboplastin time occurred but were not clinically significant and were not associated with bleeding. No complement activation–related findings were observed.\n\nALT flares (ALT ≥2× upper limit of normal) occurred in 8 of 18 bepirovirsen‑treated treatment‑naïve patients and 3 of 5 bepirovirsen‑treated on‑NA patients but in no placebo recipients. These flares were transient and self‑resolving, sometimes reaching ≥10× ULN, and occurred in the absence of bilirubin elevations suggesting liver failure. ALT elevations tended to coincide with, or follow, substantial reductions in HBsAg and HBV DNA, and were rare in patients without HBsAg decline or in healthy volunteer studies, supporting the interpretation that ALT flares reflect pharmacologic, possibly immune‑mediated, clearance of infected hepatocytes rather than direct drug toxicity. One patient had a grade 4 ALT increase (ALT 781 U/L) accompanied by AST elevation but remained asymptomatic and recovered without lasting sequelae.\n\nAntiviral activity was dose‑dependent. Among treatment‑naïve patients, mean reductions from baseline to day 29 with bepirovirsen 150 mg were −0.50 log10 IU/mL for HBsAg and −0.38 log10 IU/mL for HBV DNA, which were not statistically significant versus placebo. With bepirovirsen 300 mg, mean reductions were −1.56 log10 IU/mL for HBsAg (P=0.001 vs placebo) and −1.66 log10 IU/mL for HBV DNA (P<0.001 vs placebo). No meaningful HBsAg or HBV DNA reductions occurred in placebo recipients. Six of 12 treatment‑naïve patients on 300 mg had ≥1.0 log10 HBsAg reduction by day 29 (three had ≥3.0 log10 reduction), and two achieved transient or more prolonged HBsAg loss (HBsAg below 0.05 IU/mL), with variable durability after treatment cessation.\n\nIn on‑NA patients receiving bepirovirsen 300 mg, mean HBsAg reduction was −1.99 log10 IU/mL by day 29. Three of four evaluable on‑NA patients experienced ≥3.0 log10 HBsAg declines; two achieved HBsAg loss, one with more sustained suppression through week 31 while maintaining a marked reduction versus baseline. Baseline HBV RNA and HBcrAg levels in on‑NA patients were low or near assay limits, consistent with effective NA therapy, limiting detailed interpretation.\n\nHBsAg and HBV DNA reductions occurred in both HBeAg‑positive and HBeAg‑negative patients, but log10 declines were generally greater in HBeAg‑negative patients, who also had lower baseline antigen and viral loads. All four patients who achieved HBsAg loss were HBeAg‑negative. Post hoc analyses showed that patients with larger HBsAg reductions often had parallel decreases in HBV RNA and HBcrAg, supporting on‑target inhibition of HBV transcription. Minimal changes in HBeAg were seen overall, with more substantial reductions observed in a minority of patients.\n\nTransient, treatment‑emergent anti‑HBs antibodies were detected in a subset of bepirovirsen‑treated patients, especially those with larger HBsAg reductions, consistent with unmasking of pre‑existing or newly generated antibodies once circulating HBsAg levels declined. Anti‑HBe seroconversion was rare but observed in isolated cases with sustained HBeAg decline.\n\nSequencing of HBV DNA or RNA from selected patients at baseline, day 29, and day 113 showed no changes in the bepirovirsen binding site, suggesting that virologic responses or non‑responses were not driven by loss of the target sequence.\n\nOverall, 4 weeks of bepirovirsen treatment at 300 mg induced rapid, sometimes profound, and variably sustained reductions in HBsAg and HBV DNA in both treatment‑naïve and virally suppressed CHB patients, with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile and ALT flares that appeared linked to antiviral activity.

In the original trial, patients received hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HFSRT; 6 Gy × 5 daily fractions) together with the drugs bevacizumab and pembrolizumab. The investigators built a simple mathematical model of tumor growth, response to radiation, and development of resistance to bevacizumab and pembrolizumab, and then simulated an alternative strategy called intermittent radiotherapy (iRT), where single high-dose radiation fractions (≥6 Gy) are given every 6 weeks, with an optional 3‑fraction boost at progression. They compared the time to tumor regrowth under HFSRT versus iRT and iRT plus boost. Simulations suggested that iRT plus boost was equal or superior to standard HFSRT in most modeled patients and could extend time to progression, especially in patients whose tumors remain sensitive to bevacizumab and pembrolizumab, supporting prospective clinical evaluation of iRT in recurrent high‑grade glioma."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This work is a hypothesis-generating mathematical modeling study based on patients with recurrent high‑grade glioma (rHGG), including glioblastoma, who were treated on the phase I trial NCT02313272 at Moffitt Cancer Center. In that trial, 32 patients received a combination of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HFSRT; 6 Gy × 5 fractions over one week), the VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab, and the anti–PD‑1 antibody pembrolizumab. MRI‑based tumor volumes were measured approximately every 6 weeks and responses were assessed using RANO criteria. For the present analysis, the authors focused on 16 patients who had quantifiable tumor progression and sufficient longitudinal volumetric data (median of six post‑treatment data points).\n\nThe clinical problem is that patients with rHGG have a median overall survival under one year and no established standard of care. Localized treatments such as surgery and radiotherapy cannot eradicate diffuse, infiltrative disease, and systemic therapies (including bevacizumab and immune checkpoint inhibitors) commonly lead to eventual resistance. The original HFSRT schedule aims for maximal log cell kill in a short time but may promote competitive release of resistant subclones, limit opportunities for re‑irradiation, and provide only a single major immune stimulus when combined with PD‑1 blockade.\n\nTo explore alternative approaches, the investigators extended a previously published tumor growth inhibition model (Glazar et al.) to incorporate the effects of HFSRT. Tumor growth was modeled as exponential with a global growth rate (λ) across patients. The model includes: (1) a viable tumor compartment that grows at rate λ and shrinks with an effective kill rate γ(t) representing drug-induced volume reduction by bevacizumab and pembrolizumab; (2) an exponentially decaying effectiveness of the drug combination governed by a resistance evolution parameter ε, so that γ(t) decreases over time; and (3) a radiation component where, at each radiotherapy fraction, a fixed patient‑specific surviving fraction S of viable tumor remains, and the remainder is transferred to a dying compartment. The dying compartment decays at the same rate λ (mitotic catastrophe). The total observable tumor volume is the sum of the viable and dying compartments. To prevent overfitting given sparse data, λ was treated as a global parameter and γ0 was set equal to λ, leaving three main patient‑specific parameters: initial tumor volume V0, evolution of resistance rate ε, and radiation surviving fraction S.\n\nParameter fitting was performed in MATLAB using constrained optimization (fmincon) to minimize the discrepancy between measured and simulated volumes. A grid search over plausible doubling times (5–40 days) identified an optimal global growth rate λ ≈ 0.065 day⁻¹ (doubling time ≈11 days). The model fit the volumetric MRI data with reasonable accuracy (median RMSE ≈1.9 cm³; R² ≈0.83 on log-transformed volumes). Bootstrapping was used to assess parameter uncertainty, assuming up to 20% contouring variability.\n\nAfter model calibration to the actual HFSRT + bevacizumab + pembrolizumab data, the authors simulated alternative fractionation schedules while keeping patient‑specific parameters (ε, S, V0) fixed across schedules:\n\n1. Standard HFSRT: 6 Gy × 5 daily fractions (as in the trial), with concurrent bevacizumab and pembrolizumab.\n2. Intermittent radiotherapy (iRT): 5 fractions of ≥6 Gy each, delivered as single fractions every 6 weeks, with the same per‑fraction dose distribution (gEUD and D98% as in the original plans) and concurrent drugs.\n3. iRT plus boost: iRT as above, with an additional 3 daily fractions (boost) delivered at the time of modeled progression.\n\nProgression in the simulations was defined for iRT as tumor volume at 6‑weekly assessments exceeding the minimum post‑treatment volume by more than 20%, recognizing that RANO/RECIST criteria are not optimized for intermittent, tumor‑management strategies. To compare overall efficacy across schedules, time to progression was quantified as the time to reach the last clinically recorded tumor volume (considered a proxy for maximum tolerated tumor burden) or, for patients who discontinued for non‑progression reasons, time to a 20% increase over initial volume. Kaplan–Meier curves and log‑rank tests were used to compare schedules.\n\nIn the 5‑fraction comparison, population‑level Kaplan–Meier analyses showed no statistically significant difference between HFSRT, iRT, and iRT + boost, mainly due to small sample size. At the patient level, iRT alone was non‑inferior (equal or longer time to progression) to HFSRT in 11 of 16 cases. The 5 non‑responders to iRT were characterized by significantly higher ε, meaning faster loss of efficacy of bevacizumab and pembrolizumab. Adding a 3‑fraction boost at progression improved outcomes in 4 of these 5 patients, so that iRT + boost was non‑inferior to HFSRT in 15 of 16 patients. The remaining patient with inferior iRT + boost outcome had the highest estimated resistance evolution rate ε.\n\nThe authors then explored the theoretical benefit of allowing more than five iRT fractions, under the rationale that intermittent delivery may enable normal tissue repair and allow safe dose escalation in selected patients. They simulated up to 13 high‑dose fractions at 6‑week intervals, with the option of a boost. As the number of possible fractions increased, the simulated time to progression increased for many patients, and separation between the HFSRT and iRT + boost Kaplan–Meier curves grew. Statistically significant superiority of iRT + boost over HFSRT emerged only when up to 13 fractions were allowed (p≈0.045), and only a subset of patients (5 of 16) derived substantial benefit from more than 11 fractions, highlighting interpatient heterogeneity.\n\nBased on comparative simulations, four qualitative response groups were identified: (1) patients for whom standard HFSRT was best; (2) those for whom iRT was initially inferior but iRT + boost restored or improved outcomes; (3) those for whom iRT + boost clearly prolonged time to progression beyond either HFSRT or iRT alone; and (4) those for whom iRT (even without boost) was superior. Across these groups, the key discriminating factor was the resistance evolution rate ε for bevacizumab and pembrolizumab; tumors with lower ε (slower resistance development) were more likely to benefit from intermittent radiotherapy strategies. Radiosensitivity S did not significantly differ between groups and did not correlate with prescribed dose measures (gEUD, D98%), suggesting biological heterogeneity beyond simple dosimetric effects.\n\nThe authors discuss several hypothetical advantages of an intermittent radiotherapy strategy in rHGG: (i) potential for dose escalation with reduced normal tissue toxicity due to greater inter-fraction repair time; (ii) adaptive personalization, including adjusting fraction number, dose, and target volume based on serial imaging; (iii) repeated immune stimulation and antigen resampling that may synergize with immune checkpoint blockade; (iv) evolutionary management by maintaining a population of treatment‑sensitive cells to compete with resistant clones; and (v) alignment with the palliative goal of tumor burden control rather than attempted eradication in a setting with no curative options.\n\nThey also acknowledge important limitations. The model is intentionally simple, omitting explicit radiation‑induced immune effects and detailed pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of bevacizumab and pembrolizumab. It assumes a shared exponential growth rate across patients and uses exponential growth even at larger tumor volumes, which may overestimate growth in some scenarios. Parameter identifiability is limited by small sample size and sparse data, and the simulations cannot predict toxicity or quality‑of‑life outcomes. Moreover, the work is purely theoretical; iRT has not yet been tested prospectively in this population.\n\nIn conclusion, under a conservative, worst‑case modeling framework, intermittent high‑dose radiotherapy with an optional 3‑fraction boost appears numerically non‑inferior to standard 5‑fraction HFSRT in most modeled rHGG patients treated with bevacizumab and pembrolizumab, and may meaningfully delay time to progression in selected individuals. These findings support further prospective clinical investigation of personalized intermittent radiotherapy schedules in recurrent high‑grade glioma.""}","{""conditions"": [""Glioma"", ""Glioblastoma"", ""High-Grade Glioma"", ""Recurrent Glioblastoma"", ""Recurrent High-Grade Glioma"", ""Brain Neoplasms""], ""keywords"": [""Recurrent high-grade glioma"", ""Recurrent glioblastoma"", ""Glioma"", ""Brain tumor"", ""Brain neoplasms"", ""Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy"", ""HFSRT"", ""Intermittent radiotherapy"", ""iRT"", ""Stereotactic radiosurgery"", ""Radiotherapy fractionation"", ""Bevacizumab"", ""Pembrolizumab"", ""VEGF inhibitor"", ""Anti-PD1 antibody"", ""Immune checkpoint inhibitors"", ""Immunotherapy"", ""Mathematical model"", ""Tumor growth modeling"", ""Evolution of resistance"", ""Tumor resistance"", ""Radiation resistance"", ""Tumor volume"", ""MRI volumetry"", ""RANO criteria"", ""Palliative treatment"", ""Dose escalation"", ""Boost irradiation"", ""Kaplan-Meier analysis""]}","{""studyType"": ""OBSERVATIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""NA"", ""interventionModel"": ""SINGLE_GROUP"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Modeling study using longitudinal tumor volume data from a single-arm phase I interventional trial (NCT02313272) to simulate alternative radiotherapy fractionation schedules (HFSRT vs intermittent RT ± boost).

Lot‑to‑lot consistency was predefined as the 2‑sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each pairwise GMC ratio (lot A vs B, A vs C, B vs C) falling between 0.67 and 1.50.\n\nA key secondary objective was to show that the seroprotection rate (SPR) of the pooled 3A‑HBV lots after three doses (day 196) was noninferior to the SPR of the 1A‑HBV vaccine. Seroprotection was defined as an anti‑HBs concentration ≥10 mIU/mL. Noninferiority was concluded if the lower bound of the 2‑sided 95% CI for the difference in SPR (3A‑HBV minus 1A‑HBV) was greater than −5%. Exploratory endpoints included comparison of SPR and GMC after two doses (day 168), the proportion of participants achieving anti‑HBs ≥100 mIU/mL, and comparisons of two doses of 3A‑HBV versus three doses of 1A‑HBV using a −10% margin in an exploratory analysis.\n\nImmunogenicity analyses used per‑protocol sets restricted to participants who were seronegative at baseline, received all three doses within defined windows (for one of the sets), had evaluable serum samples at baseline and at the relevant time point, and had no major protocol deviations. GMCs were estimated using analysis of covariance on log10‑transformed titers, with vaccine lot as a factor and baseline titer as a covariate. SPRs and differences in SPRs between groups were estimated with exact confidence intervals and the Miettinen–Nurminen method.\n\nSafety and reactogenicity were assessed in all participants who received at least one vaccine dose (safety set). Solicited local and systemic adverse events (AEs) within 7 days after any injection were recorded, along with unsolicited AEs within 28 days, serious adverse events (SAEs), and AEs leading to discontinuation throughout the study (up to day 336). Reactogenicity focused on expected local symptoms (such as injection site pain, tenderness, erythema, swelling, pruritus) and systemic symptoms.\n\nA total of 2838 adults were randomized: 712 to 1A‑HBV and 2126 to 3A‑HBV (lots A, B, and C combined). The mean age was 33.5 years, 57.8% were women, and most participants were White. High adherence to the 3‑dose schedule was observed, with 93.0% of participants receiving all three vaccinations. Lot‑to‑lot consistency was demonstrated: all pairwise anti‑HBs GMC ratios at day 196 had 95% CIs within 0.67–1.50 (e.g., lot A vs B ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.67–1.00; lot A vs C ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.78–1.15; lot B vs C ratio 1.16, 95% CI 0.95–1.41).\n\nThe pooled 3A‑HBV group showed an SPR of 99.3% (95% CI, 98.8%–99.6%) at day 196 compared with 94.8% (95% CI, 92.7%–96.4%) for 1A‑HBV. The difference in SPR (3A‑HBV minus 1A‑HBV) was 4.5% (95% CI, 2.9%–6.6%), meeting the noninferiority criterion and demonstrating superior seroprotection. After two doses (day 168), SPR was 90.4% (95% CI, 89.0%–91.8%) with 3A‑HBV versus 51.6% (95% CI, 47.5%–55.6%) with 1A‑HBV, indicating faster onset of protection with the 3‑antigen vaccine. The GMC of anti‑HBs at day 168 was 118.8 mIU/mL for 3A‑HBV vs 15.1 mIU/mL for 1A‑HBV (GMC ratio 7.9), and at day 196, 5442.4 mIU/mL vs 1567.2 mIU/mL (GMC ratio 3.5). A higher proportion of participants in the 3A‑HBV group achieved anti‑HBs ≥100 mIU/mL at all post‑vaccination time points.\n\nNonresponse (anti‑HBs <10 mIU/mL after three doses at day 196) was rare in the 3A‑HBV group (0.7%) compared with the 1A‑HBV group (5.2%), consistent with improved immunogenicity, particularly relevant for populations with historically lower responses to standard single‑antigen HBV vaccines. The enhanced immunogenicity is attributed to inclusion of pre‑S1 and pre‑S2 domains and mammalian‑cell expression, which may offer broader T‑helper epitopes and more physiologic glycosylation.\n\nReactogenicity was higher with 3A‑HBV, mainly due to more frequent local injection site pain and tenderness, but events were generally mild to moderate and of short duration (median 1–2 days for local and ≤2 days for systemic symptoms). Within 7 days after any injection, solicited local AEs were reported in 85.0% of 3A‑HBV recipients vs 65.9% of 1A‑HBV recipients; solicited systemic AEs occurred in 68.0% vs 60.1%, respectively. The incidence of solicited AEs did not increase with successive doses. The proportion of participants with unsolicited AEs and overall SAE rates were low, and no vaccine‑related SAEs were identified during the study period. Study discontinuation due to AEs was rare (approximately 0.5% in 3A‑HBV and 0.3% in 1A‑HBV).\n\nOverall, the trial demonstrated that the 3‑antigen HBV vaccine has consistent manufacturing performance, superior or noninferior seroprotection rates compared with a standard single‑antigen vaccine, more rapid induction of protective antibody levels after two doses, and an acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile in young healthy adults. These findings support the use of 3A‑HBV for prevention of hepatitis B infection in adults, particularly in populations where rapid and robust seroprotection is desirable.""}","{""conditions"": [""Hepatitis B"", ""Hepatitis B virus infection"", ""Hepatitis B, Chronic"", ""Hepatitis B, Acute"", ""Liver Cirrhosis"", ""Hepatocellular Carcinoma""], ""keywords"": [""Hepatitis B"", ""Hepatitis B virus"", ""HBV"", ""Hepatitis B Vaccines"", ""Recombinant Hepatitis B Vaccine"", ""Sci-B-Vac"", ""3-antigen hepatitis B vaccine"", ""pre-S1 antigen"", ""pre-S2 antigen"", ""HBsAg"", ""Seroprotection"", ""Seroprotection rate"", ""Geometric mean concentration"", ""Anti-HBs antibodies"", ""Immunogenicity"", ""Vaccine Safety"", ""Reactogenicity"", ""Adult vaccination"", ""Phase III clinical trial""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""PHASE3""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Phase 3, double-blinded, randomized, multicenter, lot-to-lot consistency trial with three parallel 3-antigen HBV vaccine groups and one parallel single-antigen HBV comparator group."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""PREVENTION"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Double-blinded trial in which all study personnel providing clinical assessments and participants were blinded to vaccine allocation."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT"", ""CARE_PROVIDER"", ""INVESTIGATOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 2838, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""3A-HBV Lot A"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Participants received the 3-antigen hepatitis B virus vaccine (Sci-B-Vac) from manufacturing lot A.

Newly inducted patients on methadone or buprenorphine receive a 12-week prize-based CM intervention focused on attendance. The primary aim is to compare the two implementation strategies on CM Exposure (number of CM sessions per patient), CM Skill/Competence (fidelity ratings), and CM Sustainment (CM delivery after support ends). Secondary aims test whether patients in enhanced-ATTC sites show more opioid abstinence and fewer opioid-related problems. Exploratory analyses assess whether implementation climate and leadership engagement mediate strategy effects on implementation and patient outcomes."", ""detailedDescription"": ""Project MIMIC is a 3-cohort, cluster-randomized, type 3 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial designed to improve implementation of contingency management (CM) within opioid treatment programs (OTPs) that provide medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD), primarily methadone or buprenorphine. The trial addresses the public health emergency of opioid-related overdoses by focusing on an evidence-based behavioral adjunct (CM) that remains underutilized in routine care.\n\nStudy design and setting:\n- Unit of randomization: OTPs (n = 30) located in New England.\n- Design: Three staggered cohorts of 8–12 OTPs each, using a type 3 hybrid design emphasizing implementation outcomes (primary aim) while also assessing patient outcomes (secondary aim).\n- Each OTP undergoes: 5-month Preparation phase + 9-month Implementation phase + 6-month Sustainment phase (after removal of active project support).\n- Randomization: After a baseline organizational assessment, OTPs are assigned via urn randomization to either the standard ATTC strategy (control) or the enhanced-ATTC strategy (experimental), balancing on up to three organizational variables (e.g., number of patients, state, medication mix).\n\nParticipants:\n- Organizations: OTPs that dispense methadone or buprenorphine, employ at least two counselors, and induct at least one new patient per week.\n- Providers: Up to 5 counselors and 2 leaders per OTP (with no upper limit for training participation), all providing or supervising MOUD-related counseling and willing to engage in CM implementation. Turnover is anticipated and addressed via a structured replacement training protocol.\n- Patients: Adults (≥18 years) who have been newly inducted on MOUD within the past 30 days. The focus on early treatment is driven by high drop-out and missed-dose rates during the first 6 months of treatment.\n\nIntervention: Prize-based contingency management\nThe CM intervention is based on the Petry prize-based model, previously tested in NIDA Clinical Trials Network studies and implemented in the Veterans Administration system. In this study, CM is customized at the organizational level to target verifiable weekly attendance behaviors (e.g., medication dosing, individual sessions, group sessions). Each OTP defines standardized attendance targets, potentially varying by treatment phase, but consistently applied to all CM patients.\n\nKey CM features:\n- Duration: Up to 12 weeks of CM per patient, with 14 weeks allowed to complete up to 12 CM sessions.\n- Escalating draws: Patients earn fishbowl prize draws for meeting weekly attendance targets, starting with one draw and increasing by one for each consecutive on-target week; missing the target resets draws.\n- Prize structure: 500 slips per fishbowl (250 non-winning with encouragement, 209 small prizes, 40 large prizes, 1 jumbo prize). Prize values are approximately $1–2 (small), $25 (large), and $100 (jumbo). Expected average cost is ~$2.83 per draw, yielding an expected maximum of about $220 per patient for full 12-week adherence.\n- Delivery: CM can be conducted in-person or remotely (e.g., via telehealth), with electronic versions of fishbowls, prize menus, and supporting materials provided, especially in response to COVID-19.\n\nImplementation strategies:\nBoth implementation conditions are guided by the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework. The Exploration phase was completed in prior formative work. In this protocol, activities are organized into Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment phases.\n\n1) Standard ATTC strategy (control):\nThe ATTC strategy, used as a real-world control, includes three core components targeting provider-level factors (knowledge, skills, attitudes):\n- Didactic training: A training-to-criterion CM workshop (traditionally a 7-hour in-person session; alternatively, 3 virtual sessions totaling ~5 hours). Content covers CM principles, exemplars, role plays, and fidelity scoring using the CM Competence Scale. Providers must achieve ≥75% on a 20-item CM Knowledge Scale; those who fail receive corrective feedback and retesting.\n- Performance feedback (Preparation phase): Each counselor submits a role-played CM session audio recording rated by blinded coders with the CM Competence Scale. A mean score ≥4.0/7 across nine items is considered adequate fidelity; those below criterion receive targeted feedback.\n- On-going consultation (Preparation phase): Email-based consultative support helps OTPs select prizes, set attendance targets, and stock prize cabinets.\n\nDuring the Implementation phase (9 months):\n- Training support: Recorded training materials, case vignettes, scripts, and resources (including telehealth CM examples) are hosted on a centralized website in English and Spanish. A weekly CM newsletter provides tips and trivia.\n- Performance feedback (via CM Tracker): Counselors complete a brief Weekly Report for each CM patient, entering session date, attendance targets and actual attendance, number and type of draws, and self-rated fidelity items (first 6 items of the CM Competence Scale). The CM Tracker generates dashboards summarizing patients’ progress, anticipated draws, and fidelity. Leaders receive summaries to monitor implementation.\n- Monthly CM consultation calls: A CM trainer and ATTC Director co-lead virtual consultations focusing on improving CM technique (not on broader organizational implementation issues).\n\nSustainment phase (6 months):\n- OTPs retain access to CM training resources via the website.\n- Leaders are encouraged to continue local performance feedback and supervision around CM, and counselors are encouraged to document CM in routine records. No active external implementation support is provided.\n\n2) Enhanced ATTC strategy (experimental):\nOTPs in the enhanced condition receive all components of the standard ATTC strategy plus two additional, theory-driven strategies designed to enhance extrinsic and intrinsic motivation:\n\nA. Pay-for-Performance (P4P):\n- Focus: Counselor-level extrinsic incentives during the Implementation phase.\n- CM Exposure bonus: Counselors earn US $200 for each newly admitted, study-enrolled patient who completes ≥10 CM sessions within 14 weeks (a benchmark derived from trials where patients attended ≥80% of sessions).\n- CM Competence bonus: Counselors earn $50 for each month their average CM Competence Scale score is ≥5.8/7 across recorded sessions, representing a high “stretch” performance level observed in prior clinical trials.\n- Payment: Processed remotely and mailed within 30 days of benchmark attainment.\n\nB. Implementation & Sustainment Facilitation (ISF):\n- Focus: Organizational-level intrinsic motivation and implementation climate, targeting both leaders and CM counselors.\n- Duration: Begins in month 3 of Preparation and continues monthly through the Implementation phase.\n- Format: Monthly 30–60-minute virtual meetings, facilitated by an external implementation specialist, include leaders and CM counselors. Content is guided by the ISF strategy’s theoretical framework and tools (e.g., decisional balance, implementation climate exercises, performance review and planning tools) available at ISFstrategy.org.\n- Goals: Engage staff; focus them on key implementation milestones; elicit perceived pros and cons of CM; and jointly plan strategies to optimize CM implementation and sustainability beyond the study’s active support.\n- Financial sustainability planning: Facilitators work with leadership to identify strategies to maintain CM funding (e.g., increasing revenue, reducing costs, and lowering CM-related expenses via donations or other supports).\n- Process walkthrough: Near the end of Preparation, each enhanced-ATTC OTP is offered a 2-hour CM process walkthrough to refine workflows for the Implementation phase.\n\nStaff turnover plan:\nRecognizing high turnover in substance use disorder settings (approx. 30% annually for counselors and 20% for leaders), the protocol embeds a staff turnover management plan. This includes training as many staff as possible, recording training sessions for later use, and requiring all replacement counselors to meet the same CM knowledge and competence benchmarks before delivering CM. Leaders are copied on feedback provided to replacement counselors to support local supervision.\n\nOutcomes and data collection:\nPrimary implementation outcomes (Aim 1):\n1) CM Exposure (patient-level):\n- Definition: Number of CM sessions completed per patient in the first 14 weeks of treatment during the Implementation phase (0–12 sessions) and whether patients receive the target exposure (≥10 sessions).\n- Data source: CM Tracker Weekly Reports.\n- Additional exposure indicators: Number of patients receiving CM and number of counselors delivering CM per OTP, adjusted for program census to approximate reach.\n\n2) CM Competence (provider-level):\n- Definition: Quality and fidelity of CM delivery as measured with the CM Competence Scale (nine 7-point items, higher scores indicate greater competence).\n- Data source: Monthly audio recordings of CM sessions submitted by counselors; rated by coders blind to condition.\n- Benchmarks: Adequate fidelity threshold (≥4.0) and a high-performance benchmark (≥5.8) used for P4P incentives.\n\n3) CM Sustainment (organizational-level):\n- Definition: Extent of continued CM delivery during the 6-month Sustainment phase after removal of project support.\n- Indicators: Number of patients receiving CM, number of counselors delivering CM, and number of CM sessions per patient, extracted from OTP medical records and adjusted for census.\n\nSecondary patient outcomes (Aim 2):\n1) Opioid Abstinence:\n- Self-report: At 3 and 6 months post-baseline, patients report number of days in the past 30 days they used opioids (other than prescribed methadone/buprenorphine) and heroin, using a Timeline Followback-style interview.\n- Objective corroboration: Providers record urine drug test dates and opioid-positive/negative results weekly in the CM Tracker.\n\n2) Opioid-Related Problems:\n- Measured using the Opioid Problem Index (11-item count of DSM-5 opioid use disorder symptoms) at 3 and 6 months, derived from the Substance Problem Index of the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs.\n\nExploratory mediators (Aim 3):\nThe trial tests whether two inner-context factors from the EPIS framework mediate the effect of implementation strategy (ATTC vs. enhanced-ATTC) on implementation and patient outcomes:\n- Implementation climate: A 6-item measure of the extent to which CM is expected, supported, and rewarded in the OTP (5-point Likert scale). Mean scores are calculated for each provider and aggregated as appropriate.\n- Leadership engagement: A 4-item measure assessing whether leaders are committed to, involved in, and accountable for CM implementation (7-point Likert scale), previously shown to predict implementation fidelity.\n\nThese mediators are assessed via provider surveys at the start of Preparation and midpoint of Implementation.\n\nData collection methods:\n- Organizational and provider surveys: Capture contextual determinants (e.g., climate, leadership) and provider-level attitudes and characteristics at multiple timepoints.\n- CM Tracker: Weekly structured data entry on CM delivery, fidelity, and urine test results.\n- Audio recordings: Monthly CM sessions for competence ratings.\n- Patient surveys: Conducted at baseline, 3, and 6 months post-baseline via phone or electronic link.\n\nAnalysis plan:\nAnalyses follow intent-to-treat principles. Multilevel models are used, with patients (Level 1) nested within staff (Level 2) within OTPs (Level 3). Covariates at organizational, counselor, and patient levels may be examined as moderators; if no moderation is detected, they are treated as covariates. Implementation condition (ATTC vs. enhanced-ATTC) is the primary predictor. Effect sizes are reported as Cohen’s d. Mediation analyses use multilevel structural equation modeling with bias-corrected bootstrapped confidence intervals to estimate indirect effects via implementation climate and leadership engagement, with within- and between-group effects partitioned.\n\nSample size and power:\nAssuming an intraclass correlation of 0.05 at the organization level, 20% attrition, and auto-correlation of 0.7 for repeated measures, power calculations indicate adequate power to detect small effect sizes (d ≤ 0.37) across primary and secondary outcomes with 30 OTPs.\n\nEthics and oversight:\nThe study is approved by the Brown University IRB (single IRB of record) and monitored by a Data and Safety Monitoring Board that reviews annual progress, adverse events, and interim analyses. Risks are considered minimal and primarily involve survey burden and potential breach of confidentiality, mitigated through secure data handling and de-identification.\n\nOverall, Project MIMIC seeks to determine whether adding Pay-for-Performance and Implementation & Sustainment Facilitation to a standard ATTC implementation package yields better CM implementation and improves patient-level opioid outcomes, and to understand how implementation climate and leadership engagement contribute to these effects.""}","{""conditions"": [""Opioid-Related Disorders"", ""Opioid Use Disorder"", ""Opioid Dependence"", ""Substance Use Disorders""], ""keywords"": [""Opioid Use Disorder"", ""Opioid-Related Disorders"", ""Opioid Dependence"", ""Medication for Opioid Use Disorder"", ""Methadone"", ""Buprenorphine"", ""Contingency Management"", ""Motivational Incentives"", ""Prize-Based Contingency Management"", ""Opioid Treatment Programs"", ""Implementation Science"", ""Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation Trial"", ""Implementation Strategy"", ""Addiction Technology Transfer Center"", ""Pay-for-Performance"", ""Implementation Facilitation"", ""Implementation Climate"", ""Leadership Engagement"", ""Treatment Retention"", ""Opioid Abstinence"", ""Opioid-Related Problems""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Three-cohort staggered cluster-randomized type 3 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial with opioid treatment programs (OTPs) as clusters.

Forty veterans receiving care in a multidisciplinary pain-focused primary care team at a VA medical center were randomized 1:1 to (a) activity trackers plus daily text reminders (control) or (b) the same plus a weekly regret lottery (intervention). All participants were encouraged to increase their weekly steps either by 5% over the previous week or to reach and maintain 150% of their baseline step count. In the intervention arm, participants who met their activity goals had a chance to win $30 or $100 gift cards; those who did not meet the goals were informed of what they would have won had they succeeded. The primary outcome was physical activity (Fitbit step counts and self-reported activity), and secondary outcomes included pain-related physical function, chronic pain severity, depressive symptoms, and opioid use. Over 12 weeks, the regret lottery did not produce significant between-group differences in physical activity, pain, function, depression, or opioid dose, suggesting this incentive strategy may be ineffective for increasing physical activity in this veteran chronic pain population."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This study tested a behavioral economic intervention designed to increase physical activity among veterans with chronic non-malignant pain, a group with high rates of chronic pain and opioid use. The rationale is that increased physical activity can reduce pain, improve function, and potentially decrease reliance on opioids, and that behavioral economic strategies such as lotteries with loss aversion elements (\""regret lotteries\"") have improved physical activity in other populations.\n\nDesign and setting: The trial was a 12-week, single-blind randomized controlled pilot conducted at the Corporal Michael J. Crescenz VA Medical Center in Philadelphia within a specialty pain-focused primary aligned care team (Pain PACT). Data were collected between July 2019 and January 2020. Patients were blinded to group assignment, while data collectors were not.\n\nParticipants: Forty veterans with chronic non-malignant pain receiving care in the Pain PACT were enrolled. Pain PACT patients typically have chronic primary or secondary pain (non-cancer) and either ongoing or past opioid therapy or substance use disorder. Inclusion criteria included being a Pain PACT patient in the past year and owning a smartphone (iPhone or Android). Exclusion criteria included visual impairment preventing use of texting or the activity tracker and physical disability precluding improvements in walking (e.g., wheelchair-bound). The sample was predominantly white, male, disabled, and middle-aged (mean age 57), with high prevalence of back pain, mood disorders or PTSD, and history of substance use disorder.\n\nRandomization and interventions: Participants were randomized 1:1 to:\n1) Control arm: Fitbit activity tracker plus daily text message reminders to increase physical activity and to sync device data.\n2) Intervention arm: The same Fitbit and daily text reminders plus a weekly regret lottery.\n\nBaseline physical activity was measured via Fitbit step counts over a two-week run-in period before delivery of arm-specific texts. Both arms were encouraged to achieve weekly step goals defined as either a 5% increase in steps relative to the prior week or attaining/maintaining 150% of baseline steps. No standardized exercise program was prescribed; participants individualized their activity type and frequency.\n\nRegret lottery: In the intervention arm, participants who met a weekly activity goal were entered into a lottery with an 18% chance of winning a $30 gift card and a 1% chance of winning a $100 gift card. Participants who failed to meet their activity goals received a \""regret\"" message stating what they would have won had they achieved the goal. This combined a lottery incentive with a loss aversion component. All technology functions (online enrollment, randomization, text messaging, lottery administration, and activity tracker integration) were managed through the Way to Health research platform.\n\nOutcomes and measurements:\n- Primary outcome: Physical activity, assessed weekly by (a) Fitbit step counts and (b) the Stanford 7-Day Physical Activity Recall Questionnaire (PAR), capturing minutes of stretching/strengthening and aerobic activity.\n- Secondary outcomes: Assessed at baseline and 12 weeks and included:\n  * Pain-related physical function and interference (Pain Outcomes Questionnaire domains: interference with walking and ADLs, vitality, negative affect, fear of injury/re-injury, each rated 0–10).\n  * Chronic pain severity (0–10 scale) from the same instrument.\n  * Depressive symptoms measured by the PHQ-9 (0–36 total score).\n  * Opioid analgesic use, extracted from the electronic health record for the prior 24 hours in those with opioid prescriptions. Buprenorphine/naloxone doses were summarized separately due to the lack of standard morphine milligram equivalent (MME) conversions.\n\nAnalysis: Demographics and baseline measures were summarized to assess randomization balance. Categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests; continuous variables using Wilcoxon or t-tests. For weekly step-goal attainment, the proportion of participant-weeks achieving goals was calculated and trends over time were tested using the Cochran-Armitage trend test. Absolute and percent changes from baseline to 12 weeks for all primary and secondary measures were calculated. Between-arm comparisons used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) general linear models with baseline values as covariates and 12-week scores as dependent variables.\n\nResults: Of 114 approached veterans, 40 enrolled; 38 (95%) completed the 12-week protocol. Missing step data were minimal and similar across arms (about 5% of participant-weeks). The mean unadjusted proportion of participant-weeks in which step goals were achieved was 0.31 (SD 0.09) in the control arm and 0.29 (SD 0.14) in the intervention arm. The proportion achieving step goals did not change over time in the control arm but declined over time in the intervention arm (one-sided Cochran-Armitage p = 0.03).\n\nLottery engagement: In the intervention arm (n=20), 14 participants (70%) met an activity goal at least once and thus became eligible for the lottery. Fourteen participants (70%) received payments during the trial: 13 (65%) won $30 at least once, and 3 (15%) won $100 at least once; some received both amounts. Four lottery winners (20%) never claimed their winnings. Among those who claimed, total earnings ranged from $30 to $300. Most participants (80%) received at least one regret message indicating a forgone $30 or $100 prize. No adverse events were reported.\n\nPrimary outcome findings: Baseline daily steps (mean [SD]) were 5907 (3961) in the control arm and 3635 (3873.5) in the intervention arm, with no significant difference. Over 12 weeks, the percent change in step counts was not statistically different between groups (p = 0.49): the control arm exhibited a 29% decrease, while the intervention arm showed a 36% increase, but the difference did not reach significance in this small pilot sample. PAR stretching/strengthening and aerobic activity scores showed substantial increases in both arms, but no statistically significant between-group differences in percent change.\n\nSecondary outcome findings: Chronic pain severity at baseline was high and similar between groups (mean scores ~6–7/10). Pain severity increased slightly in the control arm and decreased in the intervention arm, but percent changes were not significantly different. For pain-related physical function and interference (walking, ADLs, vitality, negative affect, and fear of reinjury), baseline values and changes over time did not differ significantly between arms, although there was a non-significant trend toward greater improvement or less deterioration in the intervention group.\n\nDepressive symptoms (PHQ-9) were comparable at baseline (mean ~10 in both arms). Over 12 weeks, depressive symptoms increased by 37% in the control arm and 11% in the intervention arm; this difference was not statistically significant.\n\nAmong the 27 participants on opioid analgesics at baseline, distribution of buprenorphine/naloxone and other opioids was similar between arms. Baseline buprenorphine doses and MMEs of other opioids did not significantly differ. There were no significant between-group differences in the percent change of buprenorphine/naloxone doses or other opioid MMEs over the study.\n\nInterpretation: The regret lottery, when added to activity tracking and daily text reminders, did not significantly increase physical activity, nor did it significantly improve pain severity, pain-related function, depression, or opioid use compared with control in this 12-week pilot trial among veterans with chronic pain. Potential explanations include limited power from the small sample, short follow-up period (which may be inadequate to detect changes in chronic pain or opioid tapering), and population characteristics (highly comorbid, specialty pain clinic patients who may be less responsive to such incentives). The effect size of regret-lottery interventions might be smaller in this complex veteran population than in previously studied non-chronic pain or non-veteran samples.\n\nConclusions: In this pilot RCT involving veterans with chronic non-malignant pain, a weekly regret lottery did not yield significant improvements in physical activity or pain-related clinical outcomes beyond those achieved with activity trackers and daily reminders alone. While feasibility and acceptability appeared reasonable, future research may require larger samples, longer durations, or alternative behavioral economic designs to determine whether incentive-based interventions can effectively increase physical activity and reduce pain and opioid use in veteran populations with chronic pain.""}","{""conditions"": [""Chronic Pain"", ""Non-Malignant Chronic Pain"", ""Musculoskeletal Pain"", ""Low Back Pain"", ""Degenerative Disc Disease"", ""Spinal Stenosis"", ""Radiculopathy"", ""Inflammatory Arthritis"", ""Fibromyalgia"", ""Osteoarthritis"", ""Depressive Disorder"", ""Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders"", ""Opioid Use"", ""Substance Use Disorders"", ""Physical Inactivity""], ""keywords"": [""Chronic Pain"", ""Musculoskeletal Pain"", ""Low Back Pain"", ""Veterans"", ""Opioid Analgesics"", ""Buprenorphine"", ""Opioid-Related Disorders"", ""Substance-Related Disorders"", ""Physical Activity"", ""Exercise"", ""Walking"", ""Behavioral Economics"", ""Financial Incentives"", ""Lottery"", ""Regret Lottery"", ""Wearable Electronic Devices"", ""Activity Tracker"", ""Fitbit"", ""Depression"", ""Patient Health Questionnaire-9"", ""Pain Outcomes Questionnaire"", ""Randomized Controlled Trial"", ""Primary Care"", ""VA Medical Centers""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Two-arm, 1:1 randomized controlled trial comparing (a) activity trackers plus daily text message reminders to increase physical activity (control arm) vs (b) the same plus a weekly regret lottery (intervention arm) over 12 weeks."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""SINGLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Single-blind randomized controlled trial in which participants were not aware of their group assignment, while data collectors were aware."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 40, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Control arm"", ""type"": ""ACTIVE_COMPARATOR"", ""description"": ""Veterans with chronic non-malignant pain received a Fitbit activity tracker and daily text message reminders encouraging them to increase physical activity and to meet weekly activity goals (either a 5% increase in steps over the previous week, or achieving and maintaining 150% of baseline steps).

These conditions represent the most common systemic cause of noninfectious pediatric uveitis and remain associated with a risk of vision loss despite improvements in screening and treatment. Many children fail to respond to, or fail to maintain remission with, methotrexate (MTX) and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), including adalimumab, the only licensed biologic therapy for JIA-uveitis.\n\nRationale: Uveitis in JIA is typically chronic, bilateral, nongranulomatous, and often asymptomatic, and is associated with elevated inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNFα that signal through or are modulated by the JAK/STAT pathway. Baricitinib partially inhibits JAK1 and JAK2, reducing downstream STAT activation and inflammatory responses. Given its established efficacy in adult rheumatoid arthritis and the overlap in immunopathology between RA, JIA, and JIA-uveitis, baricitinib may provide a novel, oral therapeutic option for pediatric uveitis driven by these cytokine pathways.\n\nStudy population and design: The study will enroll at least 20 and up to 40 patients aged 2 to <18 years with active anterior uveitis (SUN anterior chamber cell grade ≥1+ at screening and baseline) and a diagnosis of JIA-uveitis or chronic anterior ANA-positive uveitis without systemic features. All patients must have had an inadequate response or intolerance to MTX at standard pediatric doses (10–25 mg/m²/week) and prior use of topical corticosteroid eye drops; some may also be inadequate responders to bDMARDs. Key exclusion criteria include uveitis not associated with JIA or ANA-positive chronic anterior uveitis, other autoimmune inflammatory diseases, significant ocular comorbidities (e.g., markedly elevated intraocular pressure, recent intraocular surgery), prior JAK inhibitor use, recent or unstable use of other immunosuppressive therapies, high-dose systemic steroids, a history of venous thromboembolism, and certain infections such as complicated herpes zoster.\n\nInterventions: Patients aged 2 to <18 years will receive either baricitinib once daily orally (tablet or suspension) or adalimumab subcutaneously every 2 weeks. Baricitinib dosing is fixed by age group: 4 mg once daily for patients aged ≥6 to <18 years and 2 mg once daily for patients <6 years. Adalimumab dosing is weight-based: 20 mg for patients weighing <30 kg and 40 mg for those ≥30 kg. Background conventional synthetic DMARDs (including MTX), low-dose systemic corticosteroids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are allowed if doses are stable. In the initial 24-week treatment period (part A), at least 20 MTX-inadequate responder (MTX-IR) patients who are bDMARD-naïve will be randomized 1:1 to baricitinib or adalimumab (open-label). Approximately 20 additional patients who are MTX-IR or biologic-IR will receive open-label baricitinib. Patients assigned to adalimumab who experience treatment failure after at least 24 weeks may be rescued with baricitinib for the remainder of the study.\n\nLong-term extension: Patients who complete the 24-week period can enter a long-term open-label extension (part B) with treatment for up to 5 years. Baricitinib-treated patients continue baricitinib. Adalimumab-treated patients continue adalimumab for an additional 96 weeks (approximately 2 years total exposure, reflecting current practice) and then switch to baricitinib for the remaining extension period. Dose/formulation adjustments for baricitinib in part B are based on age (e.g., transitioning from suspension to tablets and increasing to 4 mg once daily when patients age out of the younger strata), while adalimumab dose escalation is permitted when sustained weight increases cross the 30-kg threshold.\n\nPrimary and secondary endpoints: The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with a uveitis response at week 24, defined using Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) criteria as at least a 2-step decrease in anterior chamber cell grade or a decrease to zero in the most severely affected eye at baseline. Key secondary outcomes include changes in SUN grades of anterior chamber cells in each eye, visual acuity (logMAR), vitreous haze, and flare; time to inactive disease and proportion with inactive anterior uveitis; tapering of concomitant corticosteroids; time to treatment response; and proportion of responders at the end of the extension. Additional outcomes include uveitis-related and arthritis-related disease activity and improvement assessments completed by patients/caregivers and ophthalmologists, pediatric American College of Rheumatology (PediACR) 30/50/70/90/100 response rates in patients with JIA-uveitis, and global uveitis-related disability measures. Safety endpoints encompass adverse events (including serious events), treatment discontinuations or interruptions due to adverse events, laboratory parameters, and specific monitoring for events of special interest such as herpes zoster and venous thromboembolism. An independent clinical event committee adjudicates potential cardiovascular, venous thrombotic events, and noncardiovascular deaths.\n\nDesign and statistical methods: Due to the rarity of JIA-uveitis and ethical constraints on placebo use in the presence of an approved biologic, the study employs an open-label Bayesian design. This approach is intended to maximize information gained from a small sample size while minimizing exposure to potentially ineffective therapy. Two interim futility analyses are planned when 10 and 20 baricitinib-treated patients have completed 24 weeks. At each interim analysis, the posterior probability that the baricitinib response rate is below 40% is calculated; the trial is stopped for futility if this probability exceeds 75%. Operationally, the design corresponds to stopping if ≤2 of 10 or ≤6 of 20 baricitinib-treated patients are responders at the first and second interim analyses, respectively. If the trial proceeds to full enrollment, the final analysis will consider the study positive if the posterior probability is at least 80% that the true baricitinib response rate exceeds 57%, a threshold chosen to match the response rate observed with adalimumab in the pivotal SYCAMORE trial. An observed response in at least 20 of 30 baricitinib-treated patients corresponds to meeting this criterion. Descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals will summarize efficacy and safety. An exploratory analysis will compare response rates between MTX-IR patients treated with baricitinib versus those treated with adalimumab.\n\nOperational aspects: The trial is conducted at specialized pediatric rheumatology/ophthalmology centers in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK, under Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. A data monitoring committee of external experts oversees safety and interim analyses according to a predefined charter. Data are collected via electronic data capture with verification against source documents. Pharmacogenetic and other biomarker samples are collected where permitted, and stored for up to 15 years. After completing or discontinuing treatment, participants have a safety follow-up visit approximately 28 days after the last dose. The trial is sponsored by Eli Lilly and Company under license from Incyte and conducted as part of a pediatric investigational plan approved by the EMA Paediatric Committee.

The study focuses on whether patients achieving deep remissions characterized by undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) can discontinue active treatment while maintaining durable disease control.\n\nEligible patients were 18 to <70 years old with previously untreated CLL or SLL requiring therapy per iwCLL criteria, measurable nodal disease, ECOG performance status 0–1, and adequate organ function. The trial included an MRD cohort (reported here) and a separate fixed‑duration cohort. All patients in the MRD cohort began with a prerandomization phase consisting of three 28‑day cycles of single‑agent oral ibrutinib 420 mg once daily, followed by 12 cycles of combined ibrutinib plus venetoclax. Venetoclax was escalated over 5 weeks to a target dose of 400 mg once daily, with tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) prophylaxis and monitoring per venetoclax prescribing information. TLS risk stratification and, when indicated, hospitalization for TLS monitoring were implemented, and ibrutinib lead‑in was specifically used for tumor debulking and TLS risk reduction.\n\nAfter completing three cycles of ibrutinib lead‑in and 12 cycles of combination ibrutinib plus venetoclax, patients received one additional cycle of combination therapy during which MRD status was confirmed and response was assessed. MRD was measured in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) by flow cytometry. Confirmed uMRD was defined as <1 CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes (10^-4) in both PB and BM, documented on at least two assessments ≥3 months apart. Patients meeting this stringent Confirmed uMRD definition were randomized 1:1, stratified by IGHV mutation status, to double‑blind treatment with placebo or continued ibrutinib. In these arms, study drug was continued until MRD relapse (defined as ≥1 CLL cell per 100 leukocytes on two assessments) or clinical disease progression. Patients who did not meet Confirmed uMRD criteria (uMRD Not Confirmed population) were randomized 1:1 to open‑label ibrutinib alone or ibrutinib plus venetoclax, with venetoclax allowed for a maximum of 2 years overall, until progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nThe primary endpoint was the 1‑year disease‑free survival (DFS) rate among patients with Confirmed uMRD randomized to placebo versus ibrutinib. DFS was defined as the absence of MRD relapse, clinical progression, or death at least 1 year after randomization. Secondary endpoints included uMRD rates in PB and BM, overall response rate and complete response (including CR with incomplete marrow recovery) per 2008 iwCLL criteria, duration of response, progression‑free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), TLS risk category reduction after ibrutinib lead‑in, pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib and venetoclax in combination, and safety/tolerability.\n\nA total of 164 patients initiated ibrutinib lead‑in. This was a relatively young and high‑risk cohort, with a median age of 58 years and substantial frequencies of adverse prognostic features such as del(17p), del(11q), TP53 mutation, complex karyotype, and unmutated IGHV. After 12 cycles of ibrutinib plus venetoclax, best uMRD rates were 75% in PB and 68% in BM. Among 149 patients eligible for randomization, 86 achieved Confirmed uMRD and were randomized to placebo (n=43) or ibrutinib (n=43); 63 patients with uMRD Not Confirmed were randomized to ibrutinib (n=31) or ibrutinib plus venetoclax (n=32).\n\nAt a median follow‑up of 31.3 months (approximately 16.6 months after randomization), the primary endpoint showed no statistically significant difference in 1‑year DFS between placebo (95%) and ibrutinib (100%) in the Confirmed uMRD group (arm difference 4.7%, 95% CI −1.6 to 10.9; P=0.15). There were three DFS events in the placebo arm (two clinical progressions and one MRD relapse) and none in the ibrutinib arm. The estimated 30‑month PFS rates from first dose of study treatment were 95% with placebo and 100% with ibrutinib. At 12 cycles after randomization, most patients in both arms maintained uMRD: 84% in PB and 81% in BM with placebo, and 77% in both PB and BM with ibrutinib, suggesting durable MRD negativity in many patients even after stopping active treatment.\n\nIn the uMRD Not Confirmed population, estimated 30‑month PFS rates were also high: 95% with ibrutinib and 97% with ibrutinib plus venetoclax. Extended treatment improved response depth: about half of patients with a partial response prerandomization converted to complete response or CRi in both ibrutinib and ibrutinib plus venetoclax arms. uMRD rates in PB and BM either remained stable or improved, particularly with continued combination therapy (PB uMRD increasing from 50% to 69% and BM uMRD from 31% to 66% with ibrutinib plus venetoclax).\n\nIbrutinib lead‑in resulted in substantial debulking and TLS risk mitigation. Among 40 patients categorized as high TLS risk at baseline, 90% shifted to medium or low risk after the 3‑cycle ibrutinib lead‑in, and only 2% of the entire cohort remained high risk before starting venetoclax. This translated into a reduction in the proportion of patients requiring hospitalization for TLS monitoring from 47% at baseline to 18% after lead‑in. No clinical TLS events occurred; one case of laboratory TLS in a low‑risk patient resolved spontaneously without dose modification or hospitalization.\n\nThe safety profile of ibrutinib plus venetoclax was consistent with the known toxicities of each agent, without new safety signals. During the prerandomization phase, the most common treatment‑emergent adverse events were diarrhea, nausea, and neutropenia, with most diarrhea and all nausea being grade 1–2. The most frequent grade 3–4 events were neutropenia, hypertension, thrombocytopenia, and diarrhea. Serious adverse events occurred in about one‑fifth of patients; atrial fibrillation and major hemorrhage were infrequent, and grade ≥3 infections and febrile neutropenia occurred in a minority. Adverse events led to dose reductions of ibrutinib and venetoclax in a subset of patients, and discontinuations of either agent were relatively uncommon prerandomization. After randomization, the prevalence of adverse events of any grade and grade ≥3 events generally decreased over time in all arms, with the lowest rates observed in patients receiving placebo after achieving Confirmed uMRD. Continued ibrutinib plus venetoclax in the uMRD Not Confirmed group was associated with a higher prevalence of grade ≥3 events, neutropenia, and diarrhea than ibrutinib alone, necessitating a balance between deeper responses and increased toxicity.\n\nPharmacokinetic analyses indicated that coadministration of venetoclax did not meaningfully change ibrutinib exposure, and venetoclax exposure with ibrutinib was within the range of previously studied doses. No clear association was found between drug exposure and adverse events.\n\nOverall, this study demonstrates that a finite course of ibrutinib plus venetoclax can induce high rates of deep MRD‑negative remissions in previously untreated, fit patients with CLL/SLL, including those with high‑risk genomic features. In patients achieving stringent Confirmed uMRD after 12 cycles of combination therapy, discontinuation of active treatment and transition to placebo resulted in high 1‑year DFS and PFS rates comparable to those observed with continued ibrutinib, supporting the feasibility of MRD‑guided fixed‑duration therapy. The combination also significantly reduces TLS risk before venetoclax initiation through ibrutinib‑mediated tumor debulking. These findings provide a rationale for time‑limited, all‑oral, chemotherapy‑free combination therapy with ibrutinib and venetoclax in first‑line CLL/SLL, and inform ongoing phase III trials comparing fixed‑duration approaches with continuous BTK inhibitor therapy.""}","{""conditions"": [""Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia"", ""Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma""], ""keywords"": [""Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia"", ""Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma"", ""CLL"", ""SLL"", ""Minimal Residual Disease"", ""MRD"", ""Undetectable Minimal Residual Disease"", ""uMRD"", ""First-Line Therapy"", ""Ibrutinib"", ""Venetoclax"", ""Bruton Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors"", ""BTK inhibitor"", ""BCL-2 Inhibitors"", ""Time-Limited Therapy"", ""Fixed-Duration Therapy"", ""Progression-Free Survival"", ""Disease-Free Survival"", ""Tumor Lysis Syndrome""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Multicenter, international, randomized phase II trial with two sequential phases.

Participants are randomly assigned to receive either regular motivational and assessment text messages that encourage quitting, promote use of the Bach Mai Hospital telephone Quitline, and facilitate access to free nicotine replacement therapy, or assessment text messages alone. The main hypothesis is that those receiving motivational messages will have higher smoking cessation rates, greater confidence in their ability to quit, and more frequent use of Quitline counseling and nicotine replacement therapy than those in the control group."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This study evaluates an mHealth (mobile health) intervention designed to increase smoking cessation among adult smokers living in rural communes in Hung Yen province, Vietnam. The trial adapts an automated, theory‑based motivational text messaging system previously shown to be effective in the United States and tailors it culturally and linguistically for Vietnamese smokers.\n\nThe design is a two‑arm, community‑based randomized controlled trial with a planned sample of 600 participants (ultimately 750 were recruited to account for attrition). Eligible men and women are current smokers, literate, residents of one of four selected communes (Binh Minh, Viet Hung, Tan Viet, Bach Sam), able to receive and read text messages, and not cognitively impaired or involved in developing the intervention messages. Individual randomization uses a permuted block scheme with varying block sizes, and both participants and research staff are initially blinded to allocation. Follow‑up is conducted at 6 months.\n\nParticipants in the intervention arm receive an intensive schedule of one‑way motivational text messages plus two‑way assessment messages. The motivational stream consists of seven messages during the first week and two messages per week for weeks 2–26. Content is grounded in social cognitive theory and current cessation guidelines and includes both expert‑written and smoker‑written messages. Themes include health risks of tobacco, self‑efficacy, family motivations, quitting tips, and the benefits of contacting the Bach Mai Quitline. The messages were translated into Vietnamese, reviewed by former Quitline users and counselors, and refined through an iterative process. In addition, intervention participants receive weekly assessment texts asking about smoking in the past 24 hours and whether they would like to receive a call from the Quitline. A \""yes\"" response triggers a call‑back from Bach Mai Quitline counselors, who provide counseling and can facilitate free nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine lozenges) for up to 6 weeks.\n\nParticipants in the comparison (control) arm receive only twice‑monthly two‑way assessment text messages asking how many times they smoked in the previous 24 hours. They are not proactively encouraged by the study team to use Quitline services or nicotine replacement therapy, although they may seek these services independently through usual care.\n\nThe primary outcome is smoking cessation at 6 months, defined as self‑reported abstinence over the previous 7 days (no smoking, even a single puff) biochemically verified by exhaled carbon monoxide less than 10 ppm. Secondary outcomes include changes in smoking self‑efficacy measured by the 12‑item Smoking Self‑Efficacy Questionnaire (SEQ‑12), changes in craving assessed by the Brief Questionnaire of Smoking Urges, uptake and patterns of Quitline use (number of calls, counseling received), use of nicotine replacement therapy, details of quit attempts, and participant perceptions of the intervention. Assessment data are collected at baseline via in‑person surveys at commune health centers and throughout the 6‑month trial via the text system. Follow‑up visits are conducted in person when possible, with telephone follow‑up as needed.\n\nThe Bach Mai Quitline is staffed by registered nurses and public health professionals trained as tobacco treatment specialists, using principles from motivational interviewing and the 2008 US Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence guidelines, including the 5 As and 5 Rs frameworks. As part of the project, the University of Massachusetts Medical School team provided approximately 10 hours of additional training to Quitline staff on pharmacotherapy, behavioral interventions, individual and telephone counseling, and the relationship between tobacco use and COVID‑19.\n\nSample size calculations assumed a 10% cessation rate in the control group and were designed to detect a 10 percentage point difference between groups with 91% power at a two‑sided alpha of 0.05, accounting for 15–20% attrition. Analyses will follow an intention‑to‑treat approach. Group differences in quit rates will be assessed with chi‑square tests and multivariable logistic regression if adjustment is needed. Changes in self‑efficacy will be analyzed using repeated‑measures analysis of variance and generalized linear models. Standardized differences will be used to assess baseline balance between arms.\n\nThe trial includes data safety and monitoring procedures, overseen by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Risks are considered low, primarily related to the use of nicotine lozenges (with standard contraindications applied) and potential discomfort discussing smoking behavior. Confidentiality is protected through deidentification, secure data systems, and limited access to personal identifiers, which remain in Vietnam. The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the University of Massachusetts Medical School and the Institute of Population, Health and Development in Vietnam and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03567993). The broader aims include not only testing the effectiveness of the text messaging intervention on smoking cessation and treatment uptake, but also building capacity among Quitline staff and strengthening collaborative infrastructure for tobacco control in Vietnam.""}","{""conditions"": [""Tobacco Use Disorder"", ""Smoking"", ""Cigarette Smoking"", ""Tobacco Use Cessation""], ""keywords"": [""Smoking cessation"", ""Tobacco use"", ""Cigarette smoking"", ""Tobacco Use Disorder"", ""Mobile health"", ""mHealth"", ""Text messaging"", ""Short Message Service"", ""SMS"", ""Motivational interviewing"", ""Quitline"", ""Telephone counseling"", ""Nicotine replacement therapy"", ""Nicotine lozenges"", ""Self-efficacy"", ""Smoking urges"", ""Rural population"", ""Vietnam""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""PHASE3""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Two-arm community-based randomized controlled trial with individual-level randomization to an intervention group (motivational plus assessment text messages that encourage Quitline and NRT use) or a comparison group (assessment text messages only) over 6 months."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Participants and research staff assessing outcomes were blinded to group allocation; allocation was concealed using a permuted block randomization scheme implemented within the texting system."", ""whoMasked"": [""PARTICIPANT"", ""OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 750, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Motivational Text Messaging Intervention"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Participants receive a culturally adapted motivational text messaging program for 6 months to promote smoking cessation and encourage use of the Bach Mai Hospital Quitline and free nicotine replacement therapy.

The main goals were to determine the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities, maximum tolerated dose, and recommended phase II dose, as well as to characterize pharmacokinetics and to assess preliminary antitumor activity. Patients had recurrent, refractory, metastatic, or unresectable disease and had progressed after at least one prior standard therapy. BMS-986148 was administered at multiple dose levels on every-3-week or once-weekly schedules, either as monotherapy or combined with fixed-dose nivolumab. The study found a clinically manageable safety profile, dose-proportional pharmacokinetics, and early signs of durable responses in a subset of patients, particularly those with mesothelioma, with no clear correlation between mesothelin expression level and response."", ""detailedDescription"": ""CA008-002 (NCT02341625) is an international, multicohort, open-label phase I/IIa study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of BMS-986148, a mesothelin-directed antibody–drug conjugate (ADC), administered alone or in combination with the anti–PD-1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab in patients with advanced solid tumors predicted to express mesothelin.\n\nRationale:\nMesothelin is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell-surface glycoprotein that is highly overexpressed in several malignancies, including malignant pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma, ovarian, pancreatic, gastric cancers, and non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), while its expression in normal tissues is largely restricted to mesothelial cells. This differential expression makes mesothelin an attractive therapeutic target for antibody-based therapies that can deliver cytotoxic payloads selectively to tumor cells. BMS-986148 is a fully human IgG1 anti-mesothelin monoclonal antibody conjugated via a valine–citrulline linker to tubulysin, a microtubule-disrupting cytotoxic agent, with an average drug-to-antibody ratio of approximately 3. Preclinical studies suggested that combining BMS-986148 with nivolumab could enhance antitumor effects by promoting immunogenic cell death, increasing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and reversing PD-1–mediated T-cell inhibition.\n\nStudy design and treatment:\nThe trial consists of dose-escalation, dose-exploration, and dose-expansion phases across multiple parts:\n- Part 1A (monotherapy dose escalation, every 3 weeks): BMS-986148 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, or 1.6 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks (21-day cycles).\n- Part 1B (monotherapy dose escalation, once-weekly schedule): BMS-986148 at 0.4 or 0.6 mg/kg intravenously once weekly for 3 weeks followed by 1 week off (28-day cycles).\n- Part 2 (monotherapy dose expansion): BMS-986148 at 1.2 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in patients with tumor mesothelin expression meeting a predefined threshold.\n- Part 3A (combination dose escalation): BMS-986148 0.8 mg/kg plus nivolumab 360 mg intravenously every 3 weeks.\n- Part 3B (combination dose expansion): BMS-986148 0.8 mg/kg plus nivolumab 360 mg intravenously every 3 weeks in selected tumor types.\n\nEligible patients were adults (≥18 years) with histologically confirmed advanced (metastatic, recurrent, refractory, and/or unresectable) pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma (excluding sarcomatoid), ovarian cancer (excluding mucinous), pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, or NSCLC (adenocarcinoma). They were required to have at least one measurable lesion per RECIST v1.1 (or modified RECIST for malignant pleural mesothelioma) and an ECOG performance status of 0–1. Patients must have progressed on or been intolerant to at least one standard therapy; prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, and immunotherapy were allowed. In the monotherapy and combination dose-expansion cohorts, tumors had to show mesothelin expression at the plasma membrane with an H-score ≥100 by central immunohistochemistry.\n\nKey exclusion criteria included active CNS metastases (or CNS disease as the only site), prior exposure to BMS-986148 or other mesothelin-directed antibodies/ADCs, certain prior malignancies, significant uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, and chronic hepatitis. The study complied with Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided informed consent for study participation and tumor biopsies.\n\nObjectives and assessments:\nThe primary objectives were to characterize safety and tolerability, to define dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and to identify the recommended phase II dose of BMS-986148 alone or with nivolumab. DLTs were assessed during the first cycle (21 days for every-3-week regimens and 28 days for the once-weekly schedule). Adverse events were graded per NCI CTCAE v4.03. A modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design guided dose escalation with target DLT rates around 27–29%.\n\nSecondary objectives included determining pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax and AUC for total antibody, active ADC, and unconjugated tubulysin) and describing preliminary antitumor activity (objective response rate, duration of response, and progression-free survival) per RECIST v1.1 or modified RECIST for pleural mesothelioma. Tumor imaging was performed at baseline and every 6 weeks for every-3-week regimens, or every 8 weeks for once-weekly regimens, then every 12 weeks during follow-up. Responses required confirmation at least 4 weeks later. Patients on combination therapy who had clinical benefit and stable performance status were allowed to continue treatment beyond initial radiographic progression at the investigator’s discretion.\n\nMesothelin expression analysis:\nMesothelin expression at the tumor-cell plasma membrane and cytoplasm was assessed by immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples at a central laboratory. Staining intensity (0, 1+, 2+, 3+) and percentage of positive tumor cells were scored to calculate an H-score: (3 × % cells at 3+) + (2 × % at 2+) + (1 × % at 1+). In dose escalation, mesothelin expression was evaluated retrospectively; in expansion, it was used prospectively to select patients with H-score ≥100.\n\nPatient population and treatment exposure:\nBetween May 2015 and April 2019, 126 patients with advanced tumors predicted to express mesothelin were treated: 96 received BMS-986148 monotherapy (84 on every-3-week and 12 on once-weekly regimens) and 30 received BMS-986148 plus nivolumab. Median age across cohorts was approximately 62–64 years; 53% were male. Most had received prior systemic therapy, with 41% having three or more prior lines. The most common tumor types were mesothelioma and ovarian cancer. The mean treatment duration with BMS-986148 was 15.3 weeks (range, 2.4–115.4 weeks), and disease progression was the most frequent reason for discontinuation.\n\nDose finding and safety:\nIn the every-3-week monotherapy dose escalation (Part 1A), six dose levels were tested from 0.1 to 1.6 mg/kg. At 1.6 mg/kg, 5 of 10 patients experienced DLTs, mainly grade 3, prolonged (>5 days) elevations in serum transaminases and one case of grade 3 pleuritic pain. In the once-weekly schedule (Part 1B), DLTs were observed at 0.4 and 0.6 mg/kg, and the 0.6 mg/kg once-weekly regimen was considered above the MTD. The 1.2 mg/kg every-3-week dose was declared the MTD and selected as the recommended phase II dose for monotherapy expansion. In the combination escalation (Part 3A), one DLT occurred among 11 patients treated with BMS-986148 0.8 mg/kg plus nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks, and this dose was chosen for combination expansion.\n\nTreatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were common, occurring in 86% of patients on monotherapy every 3 weeks, 92% on monotherapy once weekly, and 90% on combination therapy. Most TRAEs were grade 1–2. Frequently observed TRAEs included increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), as well as gastrointestinal and constitutional symptoms such as nausea, fatigue, decreased appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, dyspnea, abdominal pain, and pleuritic pain. Grade 3–4 TRAEs were observed in 49% of patients on every-3-week monotherapy, 25% on once-weekly monotherapy, and 33% on combination therapy.\n\nHepatic TRAEs (elevations in AST, ALT, ALP, and other liver-function abnormalities) were among the most prominent toxicities and were dose limiting at higher BMS-986148 dose levels. Three patients had grade 4 treatment-related liver abnormalities (e.g., ALT increase, gamma-glutamyltransferase increase, jaundice). The frequency and severity of liver-related events increased with dose, but most resolved with dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation. The pattern of liver injury is consistent with the known toxicity of tubulysin and could involve both antigen-dependent and antigen-independent mechanisms, such as effects on Kupffer cells and other hepatic cell types.\n\nSerious TRAEs occurred in 18% of every-3-week monotherapy patients, 17% of once-weekly monotherapy patients, and 23% of combination patients. Serious events included abdominal pain, anemia, diarrhea, drug-induced liver injury, hepatitis (including immune-mediated), jaundice, noncardiac chest pain, pericarditis, pleurisy, pneumonitis, pericardial effusion, and pleuritic pain. One treatment-related death due to pneumonitis occurred in a patient with ovarian cancer receiving 1.2 mg/kg every 3 weeks; imaging showed bilateral reticular infiltrates without evidence of infection or cardiac pathology, and the event was judged not attributable to disease progression.\n\nOphthalmic adverse events, a concern with many ADCs, were reported in fewer than 10% of patients and were mostly low grade and manageable with topical therapies or cataract surgery. Two patients at 1.2 mg/kg every 3 weeks had grade 3 ocular events (keratopathy with reduced visual acuity, and bilateral cataracts). Proactive eye monitoring and ophthalmology consultation were built into the protocol due to preclinical evidence suggesting potential mesothelin-mediated ocular toxicity; however, the incidence and severity were lower than reported with some other ADCs using different payloads.\n\nPharmacokinetics:\nTotal antibody and active ADC exposures increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner across the tested dose range and schedules. Clearance of the total antibody and active ADC was linear, with a volume of distribution approximating serum volume (2–3 L), indicating limited tissue distribution beyond the vascular and interstitial compartments. No relevant accumulation of active ADC was observed over multiple cycles at doses between 0.4 and 1.6 mg/kg. Unconjugated tubulysin was detectable at doses ≥0.4 mg/kg, appearing within 24 hours after infusion and showing low but sustained concentrations (approximately 0.1–0.9 ng/mL) over the dosing interval. Exposure to unconjugated tubulysin at 0.8 mg/kg in combination with nivolumab was similar to that seen with BMS-986148 monotherapy at the same dose.\n\nEfficacy and clinical activity:\nPreliminary antitumor activity was observed in both monotherapy and combination cohorts. Among 51 patients in the monotherapy expansion (1.2 mg/kg every 3 weeks), three patients (6%) achieved confirmed partial responses (one with malignant mesothelioma and two with ovarian cancer), with durations of response ranging from approximately 3 to 20 months. Across all monotherapy cohorts, disease control (CR, PR, or stable disease) was observed in 56% of mesothelioma and 59% of ovarian cancer patients.\n\nIn the combination cohorts (BMS-986148 0.8 mg/kg plus nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks), 6 of 30 patients (20%) achieved confirmed partial responses: four with pleural mesothelioma, one with nonpleural mesothelioma, and one with pancreatic cancer. Duration of response in these responders ranged from about 5 to more than 10 months. The disease control rate in mesothelioma patients treated with the combination was 85%, and median progression-free survival in this group was reported as 6.5 months, which compares favorably with historically reported progression-free survival for PD-1 inhibitors alone in mesothelioma.\n\nCorrelation with mesothelin expression:\nBaseline mesothelin expression at the plasma membrane, measured by H-score, was analyzed by tumor type and response status, particularly in mesothelioma and ovarian cancer. Median H-scores were high in both mesothelioma and ovarian cohorts (approximately 195 and 192, respectively). However, within the limitations of small numbers of responders, no clear association between the level of mesothelin expression and clinical response to BMS-986148, whether as monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab, was observed.\n\nConclusions:\nThis phase I/IIa study demonstrated that BMS-986148, a mesothelin-directed ADC, has a clinically manageable safety profile when given alone or with nivolumab in patients with heavily pretreated advanced mesothelin-expressing solid tumors. The primary toxicities were hepatic and largely reversible with appropriate dose modifications, with relatively low rates of severe ocular toxicity compared with some other ADCs. Pharmacokinetic analyses showed predictable, dose-proportional exposure and low systemic levels of unconjugated tubulysin.\n\nThe study provided early evidence of durable antitumor activity in subsets of patients with mesothelioma, ovarian cancer, and pancreatic cancer. Response rates appeared higher and progression-free survival longer in mesothelioma patients treated with the combination of BMS-986148 and nivolumab than would be expected from historical data with PD-1 blockade alone, although the study lacked a randomized comparator arm. No clear exposure–response relationship with mesothelin expression was demonstrated, and larger studies would be needed to clarify biomarker-based patient selection.\n\nOverall, the data support further evaluation of BMS-986148 and similar mesothelin-targeted ADCs, particularly in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, as part of multimodal treatment strategies for advanced mesothelioma and other mesothelin-expressing solid tumors.""}","{""conditions"": [""Mesothelioma"", ""Malignant pleural mesothelioma"", ""Peritoneal mesothelioma"", ""Ovarian neoplasms"", ""Ovarian cancer"", ""Pancreatic neoplasms"", ""Pancreatic cancer"", ""Gastric neoplasms"", ""Gastric cancer"", ""Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma"", ""Advanced solid tumors"", ""Neoplasms, unresectable"", ""Recurrent neoplasms"", ""Drug Refractory Neoplasms""], ""keywords"": [""BMS-986148"", ""Nivolumab"", ""Antibody-Drug Conjugates"", ""ADC"", ""Mesothelin"", ""Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor"", ""PD-1 inhibitor"", ""Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors"", ""Tubulysin"", ""Advanced solid tumors"", ""Malignant mesothelioma"", ""Ovarian carcinoma"", ""Pancreatic carcinoma"", ""Gastric carcinoma"", ""Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer"", ""Phase I clinical trial"", ""Phase II clinical trial"", ""Dose-escalation study"", ""Dose-limiting toxicity"", ""Maximum Tolerated Dose"", ""Pharmacokinetics"", ""Safety and tolerability"", ""Hepatotoxicity"", ""Liver function tests"", ""Ocular toxicity"", ""RECIST"", ""Progression-Free Survival"", ""Objective Response Rate"", ""Disease control rate""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""PHASE1"", ""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""NA"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Multicohort, open-label phase I/IIa trial with parallel dose-escalation, dose-exploration, and dose-expansion cohorts evaluating BMS-986148 as monotherapy (every 3 weeks or once weekly) or in combination with nivolumab in patients with selected advanced solid tumors."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Open-label study with no blinding; both investigators and participants were aware of assigned treatments."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 126, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""BMS-986148 Monotherapy Q3W (Dose Escalation)"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Dose-escalation cohort in which patients with advanced mesothelin-expressing solid tumors received BMS-986148 intravenously every 3 weeks (21‑day cycles) at escalating dose levels of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, or 1.6 mg/kg to determine dose-limiting toxicities, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended phase II dose."", ""interventionNames"": [""BMS-986148""]}, {""label"": ""BMS-986148 Monotherapy QW 3/4 Weeks (Dose Escalation)"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Dose-escalation cohort in which patients with advanced mesothelin-expressing solid tumors received BMS-986148 intravenously once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks followed by 1 week off (28‑day cycles) at doses of 0.4 or 0.6 mg/kg to assess safety, tolerability, and MTD for the weekly regimen."", ""interventionNames"": [""BMS-986148""]}, {""label"": ""BMS-986148 Monotherapy Q3W 1.2 mg/kg (Dose Expansion)"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Dose-expansion cohort in which patients with mesothelioma, ovarian cancer, or non–small cell lung cancer with mesothelin tumor expression (H-score ≥ 100) received BMS-986148 1.2 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks.
