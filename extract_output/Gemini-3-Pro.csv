They were randomized to receive either oral NETA (5 mg/day) combined with a placebo twice weekly, or oral cabergoline (0.5 mg) twice weekly combined with a placebo daily for a duration of 6 months.\n\nThe primary outcome measure was the assessment of pain using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) interference scale and a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain intensity. Secondary measures included the Beck Depression Inventory-II for emotional functioning, the Functional Disability Inventory, and the patient global impression of change. Additionally, serum samples were analyzed for angiogenic and inflammatory biomarkers, including VEGF-R1, TNF-alpha, and IL-8.

Building on clinical observations that copper depletion improves survival in high-risk TNBC patients, the researchers identified a subpopulation of highly metastatic cancer cells characterized by SOX2/OCT4 expression and elevated intracellular copper. The study demonstrates that copper depletion specifically inactivates mitochondrial Complex IV in these cells, leading to reduced oxidative phosphorylation. This metabolic stress activates the AMPK/mTORC1 pathway, ultimately inhibiting tumor invasion and metastasis."", ""detailedDescription"": ""Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype with limited therapeutic options and high metastatic rates. Previous clinical trials indicated that the copper chelator tetrathiomolybdate (TM) significantly benefits high-risk TNBC patients, yet the underlying biological mechanisms remained unclear. This study utilizes two independent TNBC models (human LM2 and murine EO771.ML1) to elucidate these mechanisms.\n\nThe researchers employed a SOX2/OCT4-GFP promoter reporter system to lineage trace a specific subpopulation of cancer cells exhibiting stem cell phenotypes and high metastatic potential. These SOX2/OCT4+ cells were found to possess elevated intracellular copper levels and a distinct sensitivity to copper depletion compared to the bulk tumor population. Global proteomic and metabolomic profiling revealed that TM treatment specifically targeted the mitochondrial electron transport chain in these cells, causing the degradation of Complex IV subunits. This resulted in a disruption of mitochondrial structure (cristae morphology), reduced cytochrome c oxidation, and a shift in bioenergetics characterized by decreased oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production.\n\nMechanistically, the reduction in mitochondrial ATP production triggered the activation of the energy sensor AMPK. Activated AMPK subsequently inhibited the mTORC1 signaling pathway (evidenced by reduced phosphorylation of P70S6K and increased phosphorylation of 4E-BP1). The study shows that pharmacologic activation of AMPK mimics the anti-invasive effects of TM, while AMPK inhibition rescues the loss of invasion induced by TM. Additionally, genetic knockdown of the mitochondria-specific copper chaperone COX17 phenocopied the metabolic and anti-metastatic effects of global copper chelation, confirming the critical role of mitochondrial copper availability.\n\nThese findings establish a direct link between copper metabolism, mitochondrial function, and metastasis, identifying a 'copper-metabolism-metastasis' axis. The study suggests that targeting this axis via copper depletion reprograms the metabolism of specific metastatic cell populations, providing a rationale for future randomized clinical trials and patient selection strategies.""}","{""conditions"": [""Triple Negative Breast Cancer"", ""Breast Cancer Metastasis"", ""Mitochondrial Diseases""], ""keywords"": [""Copper depletion"", ""Tetrathiomolybdate"", ""Mitochondrial respiration"", ""Complex IV"", ""AMPK signaling"", ""Metastasis"", ""SOX2/OCT4"", ""Oxidative phosphorylation"", ""Metabolic reprogramming"", ""COX17""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""phases"": [""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""interventionModel"": ""SINGLE_GROUP"", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE""}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 75, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) Treatment Group"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Patients with breast cancer at high risk for relapse receiving oral copper chelating drug tetrathiomolybdate (TM)."", ""interventionNames"": [""Drug: Tetrathiomolybdate (TM)""]}], ""interventions"": [{""type"": ""DRUG"", ""name"": ""Tetrathiomolybdate (TM)"", ""description"": ""An oral copper chelating agent administered to deplete copper levels to approximately 30% of baseline."", ""armGroupLabels"": [""Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) Treatment Group""]}]}","{""primaryOutcomes"": [{""measure"": ""Event-free survival (EFS)"", ""description"": ""Defined as the time from study entry to the first documentation of disease progression, new metastatic lesions, or death from any cause."", ""timeFrame"": ""Median follow-up of 6.3 years and 9.4 years""}, {""measure"": ""Overall Survival (OS)"", ""description"": ""Defined as the time from study entry to death from any cause."", ""timeFrame"": ""Median follow-up of 6.3 years and 9.4 years""}], ""secondaryOutcomes"": [{""measure"": ""Lung metastatic burden"", ""description"": ""Measured by whole-body bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and/or quantification of metastatic nodules."", ""timeFrame"": ""2 weeks after primary tumor resection""}, {""measure"": ""Invasion"", ""description"": ""Assessed using Matrigel-coated transwell assays to measure the invasive potential of cancer cells."", ""timeFrame"": ""24 to 72 hours""}, {""measure"": ""Intracellular copper levels"", ""description"": ""Measured using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS) to determine the effectiveness of copper depletion."", ""timeFrame"": ""24 to 48 hours""}, {""measure"": ""Mitochondrial Respiration (Oxygen Consumption Rate)"", ""description"": ""Measured using Seahorse XF bioanalyzer to assess basal respiration, ATP-linked respiration, and other mitochondrial parameters."", ""timeFrame"": ""48 to 72 hours""}, {""measure"": ""Complex IV Activity"", ""description"": ""Enzymatic activity of cytochrome c oxidase measured colorimetrically."", ""timeFrame"": ""72 hours""}], ""otherOutcomes"": []}",

Eight healthy participants were randomized to receive either ruxolitinib or placebo 2 hours after artemether-lumefantrine twice daily for 3 days. The results indicated that the combination was well tolerated with no clinically relevant adverse events, and ruxolitinib demonstrated a predictable pharmacodynamic effect by significantly inhibiting pSTAT3 activity."", ""detailedDescription"": ""Malaria remains a significant global health challenge, partly due to poor host immunity against Plasmodium species and parasite-induced immunoregulatory mechanisms that lead to recurrent infections. Type I interferons (IFNs) are implicated in suppressing antiparasitic immune responses and promoting the expansion of regulatory T cells. Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, can block Type I IFN signaling and is proposed as a potential adjunct therapy to disrupt these dysfunctional immune responses.\n\nThis randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center phase 1 trial investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of ruxolitinib coadministered with artemether-lumefantrine. The study aimed to facilitate future research on the immune-enhancing potential of this combination in uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria.\n\nEight healthy male and female participants (ages 18-55) were randomized to receive either ruxolitinib (20 mg) or placebo, administered 2 hours after artemether-lumefantrine (80/480 mg) twice daily for 3 days. Safety endpoints included adverse events, vital signs, ECG, and laboratory assessments. PK profiles for artemether, dihydroartemisinin, lumefantrine, and ruxolitinib were characterized using noncompartmental methods. PD activity was assessed by measuring the inhibition of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3) ex vivo after IL-6 stimulation.\n\nThe study found that adverse events were mild and similar between groups, with no serious adverse events reported. PK analysis showed that ruxolitinib did not affect the exposure of artemether, dihydroartemisinin, or lumefantrine, although artemether Cmax was lower on day 3 in the ruxolitinib group compared to placebo.

The Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills for Young Adults (PEERS®-YA) is an evidence-based intervention found to be effective in improving relational skills in young adults with ASD. To translate the original American version of the PEERS®-YA treatment manual into Korean, intensive interviews were performed. Based on results from interviews, several rules of dating etiquette and social activities were modified to be culturally sensitive and linguistically appropriate.\n\nNext, young adults diagnosed with ASD (18–35 years of age; IQ > 70) and their social coaches were recruited for the randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants were randomly assigned either to a treatment group (TG; n = 19) or a delayed treatment group (DTG; n = 18). The intervention consisted of 16 weekly 90-minute sessions. Social coaches and the young adults were given concurrent sessions in separate rooms. Lessons focused on social skills necessary for developing and maintaining friendships, romantic relationships, and managing peer conflict and rejection.\n\nPrimary outcome measures included the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2 Module 4), Test of Young Adult Social Skills Knowledge (TYASSK), Korean Version of the Social Skills Rating System (K-SSRS), and Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2). Secondary measures included the Korean Version of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, Second Edition (K-VABS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Exploratory measures included the Quality of Socialization Questionnaire (QSQ), Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).

OV101 is an investigational drug designed to target specific GABAA receptors to restore tonic inhibition in the brain. In this 12-week, randomized, double-blind, Phase 2a trial, participants received OV101 either once, twice, or three times daily to assess its potential to improve neurobehavioral symptoms compared to baseline."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This 12-week, randomized (1:1:1), double-blind, parallel-group, Phase 2a study was conducted to investigate the safety profile and therapeutic potential of Gaboxadol (OV101) in treating Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). The pathophysiology of FXS involves the silencing of the FMR1 gene and a subsequent lack of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), which leads to reduced expression of the GABAA receptor delta subunit and deficient GABAergic tonic inhibition. OV101 acts as a delta-subunit–selective, extrasynaptic GABAA receptor agonist aiming to enhance this inhibition.\n\nThe study enrolled adolescent and adult males (aged 13–22 years) with clinically and molecularly confirmed FXS and moderate-to-severe neurobehavioral phenotypes. Participants were randomized to receive OV101 5 mg once daily (QD), twice daily (BID), or three-times daily (TID). The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability, measuring treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), laboratory evaluations, and vital signs. The secondary objective focused on efficacy regarding problem behaviors associated with FXS.\n\nEfficacy endpoints included the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale, Clinical Global Impressions–Severity (CGI-S) scale, the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition refactored for FXS (ABC-CFXS), and the Anxiety, Depression, and Mood Scales (ADAMS).

Participants were categorized into three groups: 1) children with no history of ROP, 2) children with history of ROP stage ≤3 without ophthalmologic intervention, and 3) children with history of ROP with ophthalmologic intervention (retinal ablation, scleral buckling, vitrectomy, or anti-VEGF therapy).\n\nPrimary outcomes were assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd Edition (Bayley-III) composite scores for motor, cognitive, and language skills. Secondary outcomes included behavioral difficulties assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and ophthalmologic measures such as strabismus, nystagmus, roving eye movements, tracking ability, and visual acuity history.\n\nStatistical analyses utilized adjusted linear or modified Poisson models, adjusting for baseline covariates including maternal race, gestational age, sex, and severe IVH. Results showed no difference in Bayley-III scores between children with ROP stage ≤3 without intervention and those without ROP.
