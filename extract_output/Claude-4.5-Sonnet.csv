Both drugs are used to prevent uterine atony and postpartum haemorrhage, but while oxytocin is known to cause dose-dependent ST-depression, troponin release, QT-time prolongation and arrhythmia, little is known about the myocardial effects of carbetocin. The study hypothesizes that there may be differences in cardiac markers between the two drugs. Following a pilot study of 40 women that demonstrated reduced high-sensitivity troponin I changes with carbetocin compared to oxytocin, this larger trial will enroll 240 healthy singleton pregnant women aged 18-50 years at three Norwegian hospitals. The primary outcome is change from baseline in high-sensitive troponin I plasma concentrations at 6-10 hours after drug administration."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This is a parallel group, randomized, patient- and investigator-blinded Phase 4 study conducted at three obstetrics units at Oslo University Hospital (two clinics) and Akershus University Hospital in Norway. The study follows a pilot study (NCT02528136) that enrolled 40 women and demonstrated a reduction in changes in high sensitivity troponin I levels from baseline with carbetocin (0.41±0.79 ng/L) compared with oxytocin (1.78±4.48 ng/L) after elective cesarean delivery, with peak changes occurring 10 hours after drug administration. Participants will be healthy women with normal singleton pregnancies at gestational age of 36 weeks or more who are able to read and understand Norwegian. Women with common comorbid diagnoses such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypertension are included. Each participant will receive a one-minute intravenous injection of either oxytocin 2.5 IU or carbetocin 100 µg during caesarean delivery. The prespecified primary outcome is change from baseline in high-sensitive troponin I plasma concentrations at 6-10 hours after study drug administration, with baseline samples collected before caesarean delivery. All troponin I levels will be batch assessed and investigators will not have access to results until after the last patient completes the study. Secondary outcomes include uterine tone grade at 2.5 and five minutes after study drug administration, adverse events for up to 48 hours after study drug administration, estimated blood loss within eight hours of delivery, need for rescue treatment, and direct/indirect costs. The study is designed as a superiority trial powered to confirm findings of the previous pilot work. Primary analysis will be by modified intention to treat using independent student t-test followed by regression modeling. Additional prospective sub-analysis will be conducted on patients who did not receive rescue treatment for uterine atony. The rationale for this study is that women undergoing caesarean delivery should be assessed for cardiovascular risk, particularly as women with obstetric history of pregnancy-induced hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm birth, placental abruption, and stillbirth are at increased risk of future cardiovascular disease. Any additional ischemic myocardial risk from uterotonic agents needs to be balanced against the benefit of reducing postpartum hemorrhage risk. Enrollment started in April 2019 and was completed in February 2022, with primary analysis expected by end of 2021. The study is conducted according to Good Clinical Practice principles with origins in the Declaration of Helsinki and has approval from the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics and the Norwegian Medicines Agency.""}","{""conditions"": [""Uterine Atony"", ""Postpartum Hemorrhage"", ""Caesarean Delivery""], ""keywords"": [""Oxytocin"", ""Carbetocin"", ""Troponin I"", ""Anaesthesia"", ""Caesarean Delivery"", ""Uterine Atony"", ""Myocardial Effects"", ""Cardiovascular Safety"", ""High-Sensitivity Troponin I""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""PHASE4""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""A parallel group, randomized, patient- and investigator-blinded Phase 4 study.

Exclusion criteria included positive test results for HIV, hepatitis B virus, known liver disease, or liver stiffness >8 kPa by Fibroscan. Donors had a kidney donor profile index (KDPI) at allocation ≤85%.\n\nThe primary outcome was HCV cure, defined as undetectable plasma HCV RNA 12 weeks after completion of G/P (sustained virologic response at 12 weeks). The 1-year analyses compared the probability of transplant for the 63 MYTHIC participants versus 2055 matched comparators from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) registry who did not opt-in to receive kidneys from HCV-viremic donors. Additional outcomes included 1-year post-transplant safety events, liver function, BK virus and cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia and clinical disease, allograft rejection, allograft function, HCV RNA levels, HCV antibody status, and survival.\n\nResults showed that the 1-year cumulative incidence of kidney transplantation was approximately 3.5-fold greater for the MYTHIC cohort versus matched UNOS comparators (68% vs. 19%, P<0.0001). All 30 HCV donor-RNA-positive/recipient-negative transplant recipients achieved HCV cure with no clinically significant liver disease or HCV-related kidney injury. One-year survival was 93% and graft function was excellent (median creatinine 1.17 mg/dl). However, there were 4 cases of CMV disease among 10 CMV-negative patients who received kidneys from HCV-viremic/CMV-positive donors. The study demonstrated that opting-in for HCV-viremic kidney transplant offers can increase the probability of transplantation with excellent 1-year outcomes in carefully selected patients when direct-acting antivirals are initiated early post-transplant.""}","{""conditions"": [""Hepatitis C"", ""End Stage Renal Disease"", ""Kidney Failure"", ""Kidney Transplantation""], ""keywords"": [""Hepatitis C virus"", ""HCV"", ""Kidney transplantation"", ""Direct-acting antivirals"", ""Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir"", ""HCV-viremic donors"", ""Organ transplantation"", ""Cytomegalovirus"", ""CMV"", ""BK virus"", ""Allograft function"", ""Sustained virologic response"", ""Deceased donor transplantation""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""phases"": [""PHASE4""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""NA"", ""interventionModel"": ""SINGLE_GROUP"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Open-label clinical trial where all 30 HCV D-RNA-positive/R-negative kidney transplant recipients received 8 weeks of oral glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P) initiated between days 2 and 5 post-transplant"", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Open-label trial with no masking""}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 30, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""HCV D-RNA-positive/R-negative Kidney Transplant Recipients"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""HCV-negative patients who received kidney transplants from HCV-viremic donors (HCV D-RNA-positive donors) followed by direct-acting antiviral treatment with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir initiated 2 to 5 days post-transplant.

Overall, 1515 participants were randomized 3:1 to receive either V114 or PCV13, followed by PPSV23. The study demonstrated that V114 administered alone or sequentially with PPSV23 is well tolerated and immunogenic for all 15 serotypes, including those not contained in PCV13, in this population."", ""detailedDescription"": ""Adults with certain medical conditions (chronic heart, liver, and lung disease, diabetes mellitus) and behavioral factors (smoking, alcoholism) are at increased risk for pneumococcal disease (PD) regardless of age. Sequential vaccination with 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) followed by 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) is recommended for at-risk adults in some countries to provide broader serotype coverage. V114 is a 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine that contains the 13 serotypes in PCV13 plus serotypes 22F and 33F, which have emerged as leading causes of invasive pneumococcal disease following the introduction of PCVs.\n\nThis study was conducted from July 2018 through July 2020 at 79 sites worldwide. Participants were randomized 3:1 to receive a single dose of V114 or PCV13 on Day 1, followed by a single dose of PPSV23 at Month 6. The study enrolled immunocompetent adults aged 18-49 years who were pneumococcal vaccine-naive, with or without risk factors for PD. The Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health enrolled Native American adults with and without risk factors; non-CAIH sites enrolled participants with at least one risk factor for PD. Approximately 75% of participants had at least one risk factor for PD at screening.\n\nSafety assessments included solicited injection-site reactions and systemic adverse events, as well as serious adverse events. Immunogenicity was assessed by measuring serotype-specific opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies at baseline, 30 days post-PCV vaccination, pre-PPSV23 vaccination (Month 6), and 30 days post-PPSV23 vaccination (Month 7). The primary immunogenicity objective was to evaluate serotype-specific OPA geometric mean titers for the 15 serotypes included in V114 at Day 30.\n\nResults showed that V114 and PCV13 were well tolerated, with comparable safety profiles. The most common solicited adverse events were injection-site pain and fatigue. Both vaccines were immunogenic for all serotypes contained in each respective vaccine. V114 induced robust immune responses against its unique serotypes 22F and 33F. Sequential administration of PPSV23 6 months after V114 or PCV13 was also well tolerated and immunogenic for all 15 serotypes, including 22F and 33F, maintaining immune responses for shared serotypes.""}","{""conditions"": [""Pneumococcal Disease"", ""Pneumococcal Infections"", ""Invasive Pneumococcal Disease""], ""keywords"": [""Pneumococcal vaccine"", ""Conjugate vaccine"", ""Polysaccharide vaccine"", ""V114"", ""PCV13"", ""PPSV23"", ""15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine"", ""13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine"", ""23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine"", ""Immunocompetent adults"", ""Risk factors"", ""Chronic disease"", ""Diabetes mellitus"", ""Chronic lung disease"", ""Chronic heart disease"", ""Chronic liver disease"", ""Tobacco use"", ""Alcohol use"", ""Sequential vaccination"", ""Immunogenicity"", ""Safety"", ""Serotype coverage"", ""Streptococcus pneumoniae""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE3""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Participants were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive a single dose of V114 or PCV13 on Day 1, followed by a single dose of PPSV23 at Month 6.

Safety endpoints included type, incidence, and severity of adverse events."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, multicenter study (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02323854) was conducted by Medtronic from January 2015 to March 2017 to evaluate the Emprint™ ablation system via a percutaneous approach in patients with metastatic or primary lung tumors. Fifteen patients (mean age 58.9 years; 67% male; 33% female) were enrolled, with 33.3% having previous thoracic surgery, 73% with metastatic tumors, and 27% with primary lung tumors.\n\nThe Emprint™ Procedure Planning Application, a commercially available software (Medtronic, Boulder, CO, USA), was used as an adjunct to assist with planning for the ablation procedure. The software utilizes pre-procedural CT images to visualize predicted ablation zones based on time, energy, and target tissue type. The predicted ablation zone displayed in the software is derived from lung-specific in vivo data collected in porcine models during product development.\n\nAll subjects underwent percutaneous microwave ablation using a single placed probe followed by surgical resection the same day. CT imaging was performed immediately after ablation with the antenna still in position. Time from antenna placement to removal was 23.7±13.1 minutes (median: 21.0; range: 6.0 to 48.0). CT assessment of the ablation was based on ground glass opacity and reviewed by a minimum of three board-certified radiologists in a blinded manner.\n\nThe primary endpoint was dose response, assessed by comparing predicted ablation zone size (from the Emprint™ procedure planning application) versus actual ablation zone size (observed on immediate post-ablation CT). Measurements included ablation zone width (X), height (Y), depth (Z), volume, and shape. The secondary endpoint was complete ablation for each target tumor, defined as 100% non-viable tumor cells on NADH viability staining. Histology was evaluated at a single center (National Jewish Health, Denver, CO, USA) by blinded pathologists. Safety endpoints included type, incidence, and severity of adverse events.\n\nResults showed that ablation zone volume was overestimated by the software in all patients. The percent difference in ablation zone volume (actual vs. predicted) was -63.5±26.3% (median: -67.3%; range: -94.9% to -5.5%). Complete ablation was detected in 54.5% (6/11) of subjects, incomplete ablation in 36.4% (4/11), and delayed necrosis in 9.1% (1/11). There were no device-related adverse events. Twenty-one adverse events were reported for 11 subjects, with 5 serious adverse events occurring in 3 subjects (20%), all either not related or unlikely to be related to the ablation procedure.\n\nThe study concluded that histologically complete ablation was observed in 55% of subjects. CT scanning less than an hour after ablation and tissue shrinkage (which can be as high as 75% by volume in lung tissue) may account for the smaller zone of ablation observed compared to that predicted by the investigational system software. The study confirmed the viability of an ablate and resect approach in the study of percutaneous ablation, but highlighted the need for future studies to account for tissue shrinkage when evaluating the accuracy of pre-procedure planning software.""}","{""conditions"": [""Lung Neoplasms"", ""Lung Metastases"", ""Primary Lung Cancer"", ""Metastatic Lung Tumors""], ""keywords"": [""Microwave ablation"", ""Percutaneous ablation"", ""Thermal ablation"", ""Image-guided ablation"", ""Lung tumors"", ""Lung nodules"", ""Ablation zone prediction"", ""Emprint ablation system"", ""Procedure planning software"", ""NADH staining"", ""Complete ablation"", ""Dose response""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""NA"", ""interventionModel"": ""SINGLE_GROUP"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""This was a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, multicenter study.

This study was conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability, and the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of single and multiple oral doses of trazpiroben in healthy Japanese men. The study design was made consistent with that of the US AT-01C study to allow informal comparison of intrinsic similarities and differences between the 2 populations.\n\nAfter a 27-day screening period, participants received a single dose of blinded study drug on day 1 (single-dose phase), followed by multiple doses of blinded study drug twice daily for 5 days from day 3 through day 7 (multiple-dose phase), without an evening dose on day 7. Follow-up assessments occurred on day 14 (7 days after the completion of the last treatment dose). The study drug in the single-dose phase and all morning doses in the multiple-dose phase were orally administered after a fast of at least 10 hours that continued for at least 4 hours after dosing, with water intake prohibited for at least 1 hour before and after dosing. The evening dose was administered 12 hours after the morning dose and at least 2 hours after the evening meal.\n\nSafety measures evaluated included adverse events (AEs), physical and vital signs, and ECG parameters. Blood samples for trazpiroben and its metabolite M23 were collected at multiple time points for PK analysis. Serum prolactin concentrations were measured as a biomarker for dopamine D2 receptor antagonism for PD analysis.\n\nTrazpiroben was well tolerated, with no clinically meaningful adverse events observed. Following single- and multiple-dose administration, trazpiroben was rapidly absorbed and eliminated (mean elimination half-life, 1.89-6.45 hours; median time to maximum serum concentration [steady state], 1.00-1.25 hours). Serum prolactin increased with trazpiroben treatment, illustrating receptor target engagement.

Minority stress theory suggests that discrimination, violence, and victimization lead to chronic stress that contributes to these mental health disparities. This study tested a novel 10-session school-based intervention called Proud & Empowered (P&E) designed to help SGMA cope with minority stress. The intervention was developed through extensive research including the creation of a comprehensive minority stress measure for adolescents. A randomized controlled trial was conducted with four high schools, where schools were randomly assigned to either receive the P&E intervention or serve as controls. The study hypothesized that youth participating in P&E would report fewer minority stress experiences and improved mental health symptoms (depression, PTSD, anxiety, and suicidality) compared to control group youth. Results showed that the intervention reduced minority stress experiences and mental health symptoms, and moderated the relationship between minority stress and negative health outcomes."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This randomized controlled trial evaluated the Proud & Empowered (P&E) intervention, a 10-session small group program for sexual and gender minority adolescents (SGMA) delivered in school settings. The intervention was developed following the NIH Intervention Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development and was based on the Sexual Minority Adolescent Stress Inventory (SMASI), which identifies 10 domains of minority stress: social marginalization, family rejection, internalized homonegativity, identity management, homonegative climate, intersectionality, negative disclosure experiences, religion, negative expectancies, and homonegative communication.\n\nThe study was conducted in fall 2019 with four public high schools in Southern California that collectively serve 5,706 students from diverse racial, ethnic, and income backgrounds. Schools were randomly assigned to intervention or control conditions. Youth in the intervention condition participated in weekly 45-minute P&E sessions during one class period, while control youth attended school as usual. Each session addressed a different domain of minority stress and included psychoeducation, didactic discussion, and interactive activities. Sessions covered: stress and coping, disclosure decision-making, family, school-related stress and resilience, peers and friendship, safety in relationships, spirituality/faith/religion, race/ethnicity/social justice, LGBT community and history, and intersections of health/substance use/HIV/medical system.\n\nSchool staff members (primarily counselors) received one-day training to co-facilitate the curriculum alongside the project coordinator. Fidelity monitoring was conducted after each session using adherence checklists. Participants completed measures at pretest (one week before the first session) and posttest (one week after the last session), assessing demographic characteristics, minority stress (SMASI), and mental health symptoms including anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory), depression (Beck Depression Inventory II), PTSD (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5), and suicidality (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale). The study received IRB approval and a waiver of parental consent to protect youth who may not be out to their parents.

It has multiple clinical manifestations, including dysmenorrhea, acyclic pelvic pain, nausea, dyspareunia, dyschezia, fatigue, and infertility. Current medical treatments center on hormonal manipulation but are often limited by lack of success, high cost, or side effects. Approximately 50% of women with endometriosis experience recurrent symptoms over a 5-year period, irrespective of the treatment approach.\n\nThe development of endometriosis involves interactions between hormonal, immunologic, inflammatory, and proangiogenic processes. Angiogenesis and concomitant neurogenesis play a key role in the ectopic implantation of endometrial tissue, its development into endometriosis, and the development of chronic pain. Angiogenic pathways are stimulated by inflammatory cells and angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α).\n\nDopamine receptor 2 (DRD2) agonists are a theoretical alternative to commercial antiangiogenic agents. In animal models, DRD2 agonists inhibit pathologic angiogenesis in tumors by inactivating VEGF receptor 2 (VEGF-R2) signaling. In contrast to other antiangiogenic agents, this type of medication has an acceptable safety profile and does not interfere with the normal establishment and progression of pregnancy.\n\nThis pilot study was conducted at Boston Children's Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital from 2016 to 2018. Eligible women were aged 15-40 years, were premenopausal, and had surgically confirmed endometriosis determined using laparoscopy within 2 years prior to study baseline. Participants were experiencing pelvic pain over the last month, as determined using a visual analog scale (VAS) score of ≥3. Nine women were randomized into 2 groups: Group 1 received 5 mg of oral NETA daily + placebo tablet twice weekly; Group 2 received oral 0.5 mg of cabergoline twice weekly + placebo tablet daily for 6 months.\n\nThe primary endpoint was the measurement of pain in multiple dimensions, including 4 core chronic pain outcome domains (physical functioning, pain intensity, emotional functioning, and feeling of improvement). Serum samples were obtained for the measurement of inflammation and assessment of the angiogenic pathway, including VEGF, TNF-α, VEGF-R1, IL-8, and other markers.

The most common cause is nocturnal polyuria—overproduction of urine at night. Nocturia has a pronounced negative impact on patient quality of life (QoL) and is associated with reduced work productivity, more frequent physician visits, socioeconomic burden, sleep impairment, higher risk of falls and fractures, depression, and increased mortality. There has been an unmet need for a validated, reliable, and specific patient-reported instrument to assess the impact of nocturia on patient QoL.\n\nThe 12-item Nocturia Impact (NI) Diary was developed in dialogue with the FDA to measure the daily symptom impact of nocturia, to be used in conjunction with a nocturnal voiding diary. The NI Diary has 11 core items assessing impacts such as sleep disturbance, emotional disturbance, and fatigue, and a single overall QoL item. This study extends previous work by investigating the reliability, validity, and interpretability of the NI Diary in a larger sample (N=302 participants) using a range of psychometric evaluations.\n\nThe study was conducted as part of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial (NCT03201419; DAWN) of patients with nocturia investigating the safety and efficacy of a novel drug for nocturnal polyuria. Patients completed the NI Diary and the nocturnal voiding diary for three nights preceding each visit at the clinic at Baseline, Week 1, 4, 8, and 12 (end of treatment). Exit interviews were conducted in 66 patients to obtain patient impressions of the NI Diary and what constitutes meaningful change.\n\nPsychometric analyses included: quality of completion, item distribution and floor/ceiling effects, inter-item and item-total correlations, item discrimination indices and curves, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, convergent validity, known-groups validity, and meaningful change threshold (MCT) determination using both anchor-based and distribution-based methods.\n\nResults demonstrated that the NI Diary is unidimensional with good model fit (CFI, TLI, and RMSEA meeting relevant thresholds), excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α=0.941), and good test-retest reliability (ICC 0.730-0.880). Convergent validity was demonstrated with strong correlations (0.573-0.730) with reference measures. Known-groups validity was supported by significant differences between groups defined by number of night-time voids. Exit interviews indicated that a 1-point improvement on the item response scale and 1-void reduction per night constituted meaningful improvement. Anchor and distribution-based analyses identified a meaningful change threshold of -15 to -18 points on the NI Diary total score.""}","{""conditions"": [""Nocturia"", ""Nocturnal Polyuria"", ""Lower

ACE screening is increasingly recommended to prevent and address physical and mental health conditions associated with ACEs. To promote ACE screening uptake, the state of California issued the 'ACEs Aware' policy that provides Medicaid reimbursement for ACE screening annually for child primary care visits. However, policy directives alone often do not translate into effective screening efforts and greater access to care. This study will test a multifaceted implementation strategy in partnership with a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) system serving low-income families in Southern California to support the ACE Aware policy. The study will use Implementation Mapping to co-create and refine an implementation strategy comprised of online training videos, a customized algorithm and use of technology to improve workflow efficiency, implementation training to internal FQHC personnel, clinic support and coaching, and written implementation protocols. A hybrid type 2, stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial design with five primary care clinics will test whether this multifaceted implementation strategy improves fidelity to the ACE screening protocol, reach defined as the proportion of eligible children screened for ACEs, and the impact of the ACE policy on child-level mental health referrals and symptom outcomes."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This study is designed to increase the capacity of FQHCs' inner context to successfully implement an outer context-initiated ACE policy designed to benefit pediatric patients. It capitalizes on a rare opportunity to use a co-creation approach to develop, adapt, refine, and pilot test an implementation strategy to maximize the impact of a new state-wide policy intended to improve ACE assessment and subsequent care to improve child health, particularly those from underserved communities.\n\nThe study has two main aims:\n\nAim 1: Use a participatory approach to refine a multifaceted implementation strategy to support the ACE screening policy in community-based clinics. The core goals of the implementation strategy are to increase knowledge, ACE screening capacity, and efficient workflows at each clinic. Four activities will be used: (1) Short video-trainings for clinic personnel on the administration of caregiver-reported screening tools through a trauma-informed care lens; (2) Technical implementation support using a combined approach comprised of external academic consultants and internal FQHC personnel to increase internal capacity; (3) Use of a validated clinical screening tool—The Pediatric Symptoms Checklist (PSC) to assess behavioral and social/emotional development; (4) Use of a technology-based tailored screening algorithm hosted in a HIPAA compliant REDCap secure web application to facilitate the screening process.\n\nImplementation Mapping will be used to guide the development and tailoring of the implementation strategy. This systematic and participatory process will involve FQHC personnel, including members of the TIC workgroup, research team, and caregivers. Three 90-minute meetings will be convened with the TIC workgroup and a separate group with caregivers to gather opinions on how to improve the experience of caregivers and child patients during clinic visits and ACE screenings.\n\nAim 2: Pilot test the feasibility, acceptability, fidelity and reach of the implementation strategy, and the impact of the ACE policy on child patient-level outcomes. A stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial (SW-CRT) pragmatic trial will be conducted with five clinics serving 3000 children ages 0-5 years old. The study will test whether clinics employing a multifaceted implementation strategy will have higher fidelity to the ACE screening process and higher reach than other clinics, and whether the ACE policy will increase appropriate child-level mental health referrals and clinical symptom outcomes.\n\nThe full pragmatic trial will last 15 months, conducted in six 10-week periods. Following the SW-CRT design, each clinic will receive the implementation strategy at different points in time and following a random order. Control status refers to clinics using standard care to identify children's mental health needs through developmental screenings, discussions with providers during wellness visits, and/or following the ACE state protocol. Intervention status refers to clinics implementing standard care in addition to the implementation strategy.\n\nThe study will use mixed methods with data including electronic health records, surveys, and interviews with clinic personnel and caregivers. Primary outcomes include reach of ACE screenings (proportion of eligible children participating in ACE screenings) and mental health referral rates. Secondary outcomes include implementation feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity, as well as changes in PSC scores. The study will also examine mediators including implementation leadership and climate.\n\nThe study is guided by the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework across all phases. The exploration phase occurred in 2018 with the FQHC identifying patient needs. The preparation phase started in 2019, convening a Trauma Informed Care (TIC) workgroup at the FQHC system. The implementation phase will focus on testing the impact of the implementation strategy and ACE policy on primary and secondary outcomes. Sustainment will focus on maintaining fidelity of policy implementation through the FQHC's ongoing quality assurance efforts and dissemination efforts to support scale-up across the FQHC system and additional FQHCs.""}","{""conditions"": [""Adverse Childhood Experiences"", ""Trauma and Stressor Related Disorders"", ""Mental Health Disorders in Childhood"", ""Toxic Stress""], ""keywords"": [""Adverse Childhood Experiences"", ""ACE Screening"", ""Implementation Strategy"", ""Pediatric Primary Care"", ""Federally Qualified Health Centers"", ""FQHC"", ""Trauma-Informed Care"", ""Mental Health Screening"", ""Policy Implementation"", ""Stepped-Wedge Cluster Randomized Trial"", ""Implementation Mapping"", ""EPIS Framework"", ""Toxic Stress"", ""Child Mental Health"", ""Health Policy"", ""Medicaid"", ""Low-Income Populations"", ""Underserved Communities"", ""PEARLS"", ""Pediatric Symptoms Checklist""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""CROSSOVER"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""A hybrid type 2, stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial design with five primary care clinics.

Previous studies of the probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04 (Bl-04) in the experimental challenge model were directed at examining the effect of the probiotic on the nasal innate immune response to the viral infection. Modest but inconsistent immune effects were noted and associated exploratory analyses suggested effects on viral shedding. Another exploratory analysis from the study found apparent effects of the nasal microbiota, unrelated to probiotic consumption, on the clinical and immunologic response to the RV infection. The purpose of the present study was to further explore in a larger challenge study the effects of Bl-04 on clinical outcomes associated with RV infection as well as assess the virologic, immunologic, and microbiomic basis for any observed effect.\n\nHealthy adult volunteers, 18-60 years old, were recruited from the University of Virginia community. Volunteers susceptible to RV type 39, as evidenced by a serum neutralizing antibody titer of ≤1:4, were invited to participate. Volunteers enrolled in the study were randomized 1:1 to the probiotic or placebo group. The daily dose of probiotic was provided in a sachet containing a minimum of 2 × 10^9 colony forming units of Bl-04 mixed with 1g of sucrose as a carrier. The placebo was provided as a sachet containing 1g of sucrose that was identical to the study product in appearance, smell, and taste.\n\nOn day -28 of the study, all eligible volunteers had specimens collected and were then randomized to active or placebo supplement to be taken daily through study day 14. All subjects were inoculated with 20-100 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) of RV-A39 by intranasal drops on day 0. Symptom scoring was done daily on each of the five days after virus challenge using the modified Jackson symptom score. Volunteers who had a total symptom score of at least 6 and either three days of rhinorrhea or the subjective impression they had experienced a common cold illness were defined as having a symptomatic illness. The primary outcome variable was the incidence of rhinovirus-associated illness compared between the active and placebo groups.

Study participants (N=333) were randomly assigned to daily metformin, placebo, a weight loss intervention with metformin, or weight loss with placebo for 6 months. Fasting blood samples were collected at baseline and the final 6-month visit. DNA methylation analyses were performed on randomly sampled blood from 192 participants using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. Nine epigenetic age measures were calculated: Hannum, Horvath, and SkinBloodClock epigenetic age (DNA methylation predictors of chronological age); PhenoAge (biomarker of healthspan); GrimAge (biomarker of lifespan); DNAm TL (DNA methylation-based estimator of telomere length); and MiAge, EpiTOC, and EpiTOC2 (DNA methylation-based biomarkers of mitotic cell divisions). These markers were selected based on their strong associations with health/lifespan and/or their novelty, reflecting different domains of human biological aging including estimates of mortality, mitosis, and telomere length. Unadjusted and adjusted linear mixed effects regression models were used to examine baseline to end of study differences in each of the nine age-adjusted epigenetic age acceleration biomarkers when comparing the intervention arms to placebo. Sensitivity analyses were performed comparing high adherence participants (≥5% weight loss and/or ≥80% pill adherence) to placebo. Results showed that all epigenetic age measurements had statistically significant correlations with chronological age (r=0.20-0.86, P<0.005), but no significant epigenetic aging associations were observed by intervention arms.

Patients were randomized to either ganglionated plexuses ablation (GPA) without pulmonary vein isolation or standard PVI.\n\nIn the GPA group, high frequency stimulation (HFS) was used to map the entire left atrium to identify two functional classes of GPs: ectopy-triggering GPs (ET-GPs) that trigger atrial or pulmonary vein ectopy and AF, and atrioventricular dissociating GPs (AVD-GPs) that cause atrioventricular dissociation. Synchronized HFS was delivered within the atrial refractory period to identify ET-GPs. If sustained AF developed during mapping, continuous HFS was used to identify AVD-GPs. Approximately 80-90 HFS sites were tested per patient with 6mm spacing to achieve comprehensive left atrial mapping.

The orally bioavailable copper chelating agent tetrathiomolybdate (TM) has shown significant survival benefits in high-risk TNBC patients. Using two independent TNBC models, the researchers identified a discrete subpopulation of highly metastatic SOX2/OCT4+ cells within primary tumors that exhibit elevated intracellular copper levels and marked sensitivity to TM. Global proteomic and metabolomic profiling revealed that TM-mediated inactivation of mitochondrial Complex IV is the primary metabolic defect in the SOX2/OCT4+ cell population. The study also identifies the AMPK/mTORC1 energy sensor pathway as an important downstream mediator, and shows that AMPK inhibition rescues TM-mediated loss of invasion. Loss of the mitochondria-specific copper chaperone COX17 restricts copper deficiency to mitochondria and phenocopies TM-mediated alterations. These findings identify a copper-metabolism-metastasis axis with potential to enrich patient populations in next-generation therapeutic trials."", ""detailedDescription"": ""Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by the absence of estrogen receptor (ER−), progesterone receptor (PR−), and HER2 overexpression (HER2−). TNBC accounts for 10-15% of all breast cancers and is associated with poor outcomes due to lack of response to current targeted therapies and higher rates of metastasis. Copper serves as a cofactor for metalloenzymes that contribute to malignant progression. The copper chelating agent tetrathiomolybdate (TM) has been associated with significant survival benefit in high-risk TNBC patients. A phase II clinical trial (NCT00195091) showed that TM was safe and well-tolerated, with event-free survival (EFS) of 72% and overall survival (OS) of 84% at median follow-up of 6.3 years. The TNBC cohort with stage 4 disease showed EFS of 69% after 2 years, a striking finding compared to median EFS and OS of less than 8 months and 12 months, respectively, in other trials.\n\nThis study uses in vivo lineage tracing of the metastatic compartment in primary breast tumors, together with proteomic and metabolomic profiling, to provide a direct link between copper-mediated metabolic reprogramming and metastasis in TNBC. Using the SOX2/OCT4-GFP promoter reporter system, the researchers lineage traced a subpopulation of SOX2+OCT4+ cancer cells within the primary tumor that exhibit stem cell phenotypes and enhanced potential for metastasis. These cells showed higher basal intracellular copper levels compared to reporter-negative cells and exhibited marked sensitivity to TM-mediated copper depletion.\n\nQuantitative protein abundance profiling using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) identified multiple subunits of mitochondrial Complex IV that were specifically downregulated after TM treatment in reporter-positive cells. Gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment of pathways involved in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). TM-mediated copper depletion led to degradation of Complex IV subunits and resulted in significant reduction (>60%) in oxidation of cytochrome c. Extracellular flux analysis showed that reporter-positive cells exhibited higher rates of oxygen consumption compared to reporter-negative cells, and TM treatment resulted in dramatic reduction in basal respiration and ATP-linked respiration in reporter-positive cells.\n\nTo confirm that mitochondrial copper depletion was responsible for the observed phenotypes, the researchers targeted COX17, a mitochondria-specific copper chaperone that transports copper to Complex IV. COX17 knockdown reduced oxygen consumption, ATP-linked respiration, invasion, and lung metastases, phenocopying TM-mediated alterations. TM-mediated reduction in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) decreased ATP production and triggered activation of the AMPK-mTORC1 pathway. AMPK inhibition rescued TM-mediated loss of invasion, demonstrating that AMPK is a downstream mediator of TM-mediated invasion defects.\n\nThese findings identify a copper-metabolism-metastasis axis and highlight its potential to be developed as a next-generation therapeutic approach for high-risk TNBC patients.

It directly interacts with viral polymerases to inhibit viral RNA transcription without affecting host polymerases. The drug can be orally administered and achieves sustainable serum levels. It is licensed in Japan to treat influenza virus unresponsive to other agents.\n\nIn vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that favipiravir inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication by binding to the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and suppressing viral replication through inhibition of natural nucleoside incorporation. The drug appears to act by generating disadvantageous mutations in the virus, potentially leading to \""mutational meltdown,\"" similar to its mechanism against influenza.\n\nThis phase 2 proof-of-concept trial was conducted from April 2020 through October 2020 at 7 US academic medical centers. Hospitalized adults (age 18-80 years) with PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection within 72 hours of hospitalization and within 7 days of first positive PCR were eligible. Patients were stratified by disease severity and randomized within 72 hours of hospitalization. The planned duration of favipiravir therapy was 14 days, continued after discharge if needed. Follow-up period was 46 days after the active treatment phase.\n\nThe primary endpoint was time to viral clearance on day 29, defined as time to first negative or below lower limit of quantification PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs. Secondary endpoints included clinical recovery status, time to clinical recovery, NEWS2 scores, mortality, respiratory progression, time to defervescence, viral load changes, mechanical ventilation requirements, safety assessments, C-reactive protein levels, and pharmacokinetic analysis.\n\nResults showed median time to viral clearance was 16.0 days (90% CI, 12.0-29.0) in the favipiravir group versus 30.0 days (90% CI, 12.0-31.0) in the SOC group (P=0.0415). Post hoc analysis revealed enhanced effect in patients who were neutralizing antibody-negative at randomization and in those treated within 7 days of symptom onset.

The study aimed to assess the feasibility, safety, immunogenicity, and clinical efficacy of the IDO/PD-L1 peptide vaccine (IO102/IO103) combined with nivolumab in patients with metastatic melanoma.\n\nThe vaccine consists of two peptides: IO102 (a 21-amino-acid peptide from IDO) and IO103 (a 19-amino-acid peptide from the signal peptide of PD-L1), each at 100 µg, mixed with Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant. The vaccine was administered subcutaneously biweekly for the first six doses, then every 4 weeks, for a maximum of 15 vaccinations over approximately 9 months. Nivolumab was administered intravenously at 3 mg/kg biweekly for 24 cycles, followed by 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks as standard of care for responding patients, for up to 2 years.\n\nThe primary objective was to evaluate safety and feasibility. Secondary objectives included assessment of immunogenicity through detection of vaccine-specific T cell responses in peripheral blood and tumor biopsies, and evaluation of clinical efficacy measured by objective response rate (ORR), complete response rate (CRR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.\n\nPatients eligible for enrollment were adults (≥18 years) with locally advanced or stage 4 melanoma (AJCC 7th edition), at least one measurable lesion, ECOG performance status 0-1, and no prior anti-PD-1 therapy.

Blood samples for immunologic analyses were collected at baseline, during treatment (cycles 3, 6, 12, 18, 24), and 3 and 6 months post-vaccination. Tumor biopsies were obtained at baseline and after six cycles when accessible. Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin tests were performed after cycle 6 to evaluate skin-infiltrating lymphocytes reactive to the vaccine peptides.\n\nImmunogenicity was assessed using interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays, flow cytometry for intracellular cytokine staining, and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing. Functional characterization of vaccine-specific T cells included assessment of cytolytic markers (CD107a), cytokine production (IFN-γ, TNF-α), and recognition of target cells expressing IDO and/or PD-L1.\n\nClinical efficacy was evaluated using FDG PET-CT scans at baseline and every 3 months until progression.

The NMES device used was the geko™ T-1, applied transcutaneously to the common peroneal nerve at the knee, causing intermittent electrical pulses (27mA, 1 Hz) that produce contractions of the anterior and lateral compartments of the leg.\n\nHaemodynamic venous measurements were taken from the right femoral vein using ultrasound, measuring peak velocity (PV), time averaged mean velocity (TAMV), and volume flow (VF). Laser Doppler fluximetry was performed on the left hand and foot. Leg volume was calculated using ankle and maximal calf diameters. All measurements were taken at baseline and repeated at week 6.\n\nDevices were worn bilaterally for 4-6 hours per day, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks. After week 6, NMES was discontinued.

Eligible patients had RECIST v1.1-measurable disease, ECOG performance status 0 or 1, documented disease progression during or after first-line platinum/fluoropyrimidine doublet chemotherapy, and available tumor samples for PD-L1 assessment. Patients with HER2-negative tumors were eligible; those with HER2-positive tumors required documentation of disease progression on trastuzumab-containing treatment.\n\nPatients were stratified by time to progression on first-line therapy (<6 vs ≥6 months) and ECOG PS (0 vs 1). Treatment continued until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, investigator decision, or patient withdrawal. Tumor response was assessed every 6 weeks by blinded central radiology review according to RECIST v1.1. PD-L1 expression was centrally assessed using PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx, with CPS ≥1 defining PD-L1-positive tumors.\n\nThe study originally planned to enroll 360 patients with the final analysis event-driven after 290 OS events, which would provide ~91% power to demonstrate superiority of pembrolizumab at a 1-sided α of 0.0215 if the underlying HR for OS was 0.67. However, enrollment was terminated early after results from the global KEYNOTE-061 study showed that pembrolizumab did not significantly prolong OS compared with paclitaxel in patients previously treated for advanced gastric cancer. Between February 16, 2017, and March 12, 2018, 94 patients were enrolled (47 pembrolizumab/47 paclitaxel). Patients were followed until the last patient's last visit on June 21, 2021, with a database cutoff date of October 8, 2019 for the current analysis.\n\nDue to early termination, the study lacked statistical power for definitive conclusions. Results showed median OS of 8 months in both treatment groups (HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.63-1.54), median PFS of 2 months with pembrolizumab versus 4 months with paclitaxel (HR 1.62; 95% CI 1.04-2.52), and ORR of 13% versus 19%, respectively.

Evidence supports the use of text messages to support adherence, but there remains much opportunity to improve their effectiveness. One key limitation is that message content has been generic. By contrast, reinforcement learning is a machine learning method that can be used to identify individuals' patterns of responsiveness by observing their response to cues and then optimizing them accordingly. Despite its demonstrated benefits outside of healthcare, its application to tailoring communication for patients has received limited attention. The objective of this trial is to test the impact of a reinforcement learning-based text messaging program on adherence to medication for patients with type 2 diabetes."", ""detailedDescription"": ""In the REINFORCE trial, 60 patients with suboptimal diabetes control treated with oral diabetes medications are being randomized to receive a reinforcement learning intervention or control. Subjects in both arms receive electronic pill bottles to use, and those in the intervention arm receive up to daily text messages. The messages are individually adapted using a reinforcement learning prediction algorithm based on daily adherence measurements from the pill bottles. The core component of the intervention is a reinforcement learning program that personalizes daily text message outreach based on data from the electronic pill bottles. Beginning the morning after randomization, the program predicts which text message will be most likely to cause a patient to take their medications; the corresponding text message is then sent. The effectiveness of each message is assessed the next morning based on whether the medication doses were actually taken. The text messages are based on existing behavioral science principles and incorporate five factors: (1) framing (neutral, positive or negative), (2) observed feedback (number of days in the previous week that patients had evidence of medication-taking), (3) social reinforcement (mentioning loved ones), (4) nature of content (medication reminder or information about medications or lifestyle), and (5) reflection (designed to invoke introspection). The reinforcement learning algorithm is hosted on a HIPAA-compliant Microsoft Azure server and integrates electronic pill bottle data, patient data from REDCap, and the reinforcement learning prediction model algorithm housed by Microsoft Personalizer. The trial's primary outcome is average adherence to medication over the 6-month follow-up period.

Peer narratives can provide personally relevant messages that help address mistrust and promote behavior change. In previous work, the research team developed video-recorded stories of African American Veterans sharing their hypertension self-management experiences, which showed promise in engaging viewers and promoting intent to change behaviors, but did not lead to sustained blood pressure improvements.\n\nObjective: This study aims to describe the process of developing a text-messaging protocol that incorporates the voices of African American Veteran storytellers to provide longitudinal support for hypertension self-management after viewing storytelling videos.\n\nMethods: The multidisciplinary team used a multistep process to transform video-recorded story excerpts from 5 Veterans into 160-character text messages integrated into comprehensive 6-month texting protocols. The process included: (1) iterative review of story transcripts to identify vernacular features and key self-management concepts, (2) creation of three types of text messages (narrative, educational, and interactive), and (3) extensive consultation with two African American Veteran consultants who guided the development of culturally sensitive content. The protocol was designed for use in the VA Annie text-messaging platform. Social Cognitive Theory informed the approach to framing messages aimed at enhancing self-efficacy and influencing health behaviors.\n\nResults: Five 6-month text-messaging protocols were programmed within the Annie system, each corresponding to a single Veteran storyteller. Each protocol includes cycles of narrative messages (incorporating storyteller quotes), educational messages (based on guidelines from the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and CDC), and two-way interactive messages assessing self-efficacy and behavior. The 26-week protocol addresses 9 key content areas related to hypertension self-management, with some topics repeated. Each 2-week block focuses on a single key concept and contains 8 text messages. Interactive texts serve as 'bookends' at the beginning and end of each 2-week period. Veterans will choose the storyteller that most resonates with their experiences, which will determine their assigned texting protocol.\n\nVeteran consultant input was critical in ensuring cultural sensitivity, including guidance on using standard spelling rather than colloquial transcriptions, the order and timing of messages, and the integration of different message types.

Opioid use disorder often begins with prescription opioids for medical conditions, with risk factors including greater pain intensity and pain catastrophizing. Non-pharmacological pain interventions are critical to address this epidemic. Virtual reality (VR) therapy has shown promise as a distraction tool and pain modifier during medical procedures, but little is known about its use for acute pain following traumatic injury, and no studies have investigated VR in traumatic brain injury (TBI). This study aims to establish the safety and effectiveness of VR therapy in the inpatient setting for acute traumatic injuries, including TBI. The hypothesis is that VR therapy is safe and feasible for patients with acute traumatic injuries including TBI, reduces pain while improving pain-related affective and autonomic measures, and that patient factors such as gaming engagement, boredom, suggestibility and expectancy predict response to VR therapy."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This is a randomized, within-subject, crossover clinical trial comparing the effects of immersive VR therapy against two control interventions in 60 patients with traumatic injury, including TBI. One control intervention presents identical content to the immersive VR environment in a non-immersive, tablet-based form. The other control intervention controls for external sensory deprivation by having participants wear the VR headset without any content.\n\nParticipants complete a prestudy survey to assess baseline characteristics and symptoms including the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Multidimensional State Boredom Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Survey, Opioid Risk Tool, and Multidimensional Iowa Suggestibility Scale. Participants then undergo three different 20-minute sessions administered in random order and spaced at least 4 hours apart: (1) Immersive VR experience using theBlu delivered via Oculus Rift headset, (2) Non-immersive 2-D recording of theBlu on a tablet, and (3) VR sensory deprivation using a blank Oculus Rift headset.\n\nBefore and after each session, participants complete surveys including numeric rating scales for pain, headache, neck/back pain, nausea, dizziness, light sensitivity, and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Post-session surveys also include the Brockmyer Gaming Engagement Questionnaire. Vital signs including heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and pupillometry data are recorded pre- and post-session. Continuous heart rate is collected during sessions. Opioid usage and pain scores throughout hospitalization are obtained via chart review.\n\nThe primary outcome is reduction in pain severity measured by numerical rating scale for VR sessions compared to controls. Secondary outcomes include pain assessment, opioid usage, pain durability post-session, affective measures (anxiety), autonomic measures (pupillary metrics and heart rate variability), and subjective experience measures. Safety is assessed by monitoring for seizures, dizziness, nausea, and ability to tolerate sessions. Mixed-effects models will be used to analyze differences between ratings over time. The study will enroll 60 patients to account for 30% dropout, leaving 42 patients to provide 80% power to detect a 2-point difference on a 0-10 pain scale at a one-sided 0.05 significance level.""}","{""conditions"": [""Traumatic Injury"", ""Traumatic Brain Injury"", ""Acute Pain"", ""Opioid Use Disorder""], ""keywords"": [""Virtual Reality"", ""VR Therapy"", ""Pain Management"", ""Non-pharmacological Analgesia"", ""Opioid Sparing"", ""Immersive Virtual Reality"", ""Acute Traumatic Injury"", ""Mild Traumatic Brain Injury"", ""Pain Catastrophizing"", ""Anxiety"", ""Depression"", ""Gaming Engagement"", ""Suggestibility"", ""Heart Rate Variability"", ""Pupillometry"", ""Trauma Center""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""CROSSOVER"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Randomised, within-subject, crossover clinical trial comparing the effects of an immersive VR environment against two control interventions.

Exclusion criteria included recent receipt of investigational or non-registered vaccines or drugs, and planned receipt of any investigational SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either CVnCoV or placebo, stratified by country and age group (18-60 years and ≥61 years). CVnCoV is a chemically unmodified mRNA vaccine candidate encoding the stabilised, full-length, native SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, protected by lipid nanoparticles. Each dose contained 12 μg of mRNA in 0.6 mL, administered intramuscularly on days 1 and 29.\n\nThe primary efficacy outcome was virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 of any severity from 15 days after the second dose up to 1 year. Key secondary endpoints included moderate-to-severe COVID-19, severe COVID-19, and COVID-19 by age group. An exploratory endpoint assessed efficacy against individual variants of concern or interest. The trial was event-driven, requiring 160 COVID-19 cases for final analysis with 90% power to show vaccine efficacy greater than 30%.\n\nSafety outcomes included solicited local and systemic adverse events for 7 days after each dose, unsolicited adverse events for 28 days after each dose in phase 2b participants, and serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest up to 1 year after the second dose. Participants were monitored for COVID-19 symptoms through twice-weekly mobile application contacts and underwent RT-PCR testing upon suspicion of COVID-19. Viral sequencing was performed to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\nThe primary efficacy analysis included 12,851 participants in the CVnCoV group and 12,211 in the placebo group, with a mean observation period of 48.2 days. The trial met prespecified success criteria for efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 of any severity (vaccine efficacy 48.2%, 95.826% CI 31.0-61.4) and moderate-to-severe COVID-19 (vaccine efficacy 70.7%, 95% CI 42.5-86.1). Approximately 50% of COVID-19 cases were caused by variants of concern, 35% by variants of interest, and only 3% by wild-type B.1 lineage SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine efficacy was similar against alpha, gamma, and lambda variants in participants aged 18-60 years.\n\nSolicited adverse events were more common in CVnCoV recipients (96.5%) than placebo recipients (67.9%), but were mostly transient and mild-to-moderate. The most frequently reported local reaction was injection-site pain (83.6%), and the most common systemic reactions were fatigue (80.0%) and headache (76.9%). Serious adverse events were uncommon and similar between groups (0.4% CVnCoV vs 0.3% placebo).

The study hypothesis is that inhibiting leukotriene production through FLAP inhibition will reduce albuminuria and provide kidney protection through a novel anti-inflammatory mechanism. Participants receive AZD5718 at 3 different doses or placebo once daily for 12 weeks, followed by an 8-week extension where they also receive dapagliflozin (10 mg/d) as anticipated future standard of care. The primary objective is to evaluate the dose-response effect of AZD5718 plus dapagliflozin on urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) after 20 weeks. The study aims to enroll 632 participants and will provide data on the effects of 5-lipoxygenase pathway inhibition in patients with proteinuric CKD."", ""detailedDescription"": ""FLAIR is an ongoing phase 2b study designed to evaluate AZD5718, a potent, selective, and reversible FLAP inhibitor that suppresses leukotriene production, in patients with proteinuric CKD. Leukotrienes are proinflammatory and vasoconstrictive lipid mediators implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases and CKD pathogenesis. Despite available treatments including ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and SGLT2 inhibitors, patients with CKD remain at risk for kidney and cardiovascular events due to residual albuminuria, indicating incomplete protection.\n\nThe study enrolls patients aged 18 years or older with eGFR of 20-75 ml/min per 1.73 m² and albuminuria of 200-5000 mg/g creatinine. Approximately one-third of participants have nondiabetic kidney disease and two-thirds have diabetic kidney disease (type 2 diabetes). Participants must be on stable doses of ACE inhibitors and/or ARBs for at least 4 weeks before randomization.\n\nParticipants are randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive oral AZD5718 at 3 different doses or matching placebo once daily for 12 weeks, followed by the same treatment plus dapagliflozin 10 mg/d for 8 weeks. The study design allows evaluation of AZD5718 with both current standard of care (minimal SGLT2 inhibitor use) and anticipated future standard of care (universal SGLT2 inhibitor use).\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint is the dose-response effect of AZD5718 plus dapagliflozin on UACR after 20 weeks. Key secondary objectives include the dose-response effect of AZD5718 plus current standard of care on UACR at 12 weeks, and assessment of acute effects on eGFR. Additional objectives include safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and biomarker analyses to predict or reflect response to AZD5718. Exploratory objectives include assessment of leukotriene E4 levels, additional biomarkers, and an optional retinal substudy in participants with diabetic kidney disease.\n\nThe planned sample size of 632 participants provides 91% power to detect a 30% reduction in UACR between the maximum dose of AZD5718 and placebo. The study started in October 2020 and is recruiting at approximately 120 sites in 11 countries, with completion expected in late 2022.""}","{""conditions"": [""Chronic Kidney Disease"", ""Diabetic Kidney Disease"", ""Proteinuric Chronic Kidney Disease"", ""Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus"", ""Albuminuria""], ""keywords"": [""Chronic kidney disease"", ""5-lipoxygenase activating protein"", ""FLAP inhibitor"", ""AZD5718"", ""Leukotrienes"", ""Albuminuria"", ""Proteinuria"", ""Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio"", ""UACR"", ""Type 2 diabetes"", ""Diabetic kidney disease"", ""Nondiabetic kidney disease"", ""SGLT2 inhibitor"", ""Dapagliflozin"", ""Inflammation"", ""Estimated glomerular filtration rate"", ""eGFR"", ""Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system"", ""ACE inhibitors"", ""Angiotensin receptor blockers""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Participants are randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive oral AZD5718 at 3 different doses or matching placebo tablets once daily for 12 weeks, followed by the same treatment plus dapagliflozin 10 mg/d for 8 weeks."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Participants and the study team are blinded to treatment assignments throughout the study.

The study aimed to determine whether MPH + escitalopram resulted in higher rates of medication adherence compared to placebo + escitalopram over an 8-week treatment period."", ""detailedDescription"": ""Adherence to antidepressant treatment is a critical challenge in mental health care, with only one out of five patients complying with treatment for over 4 months. Non-adherence leads to adverse consequences including increased relapse, recurrence, and significant healthcare costs. This study was based on the premise that forming new treatment-related habits requires a transition from reward-related to habit-based behavioral strategies. Depressed individuals face specific barriers to habit formation including reduced hedonic processing mediated by impaired dopaminergic function and compromised functioning of neural circuits involved in habit formation (hippocampus to basal ganglia transition).\n\nThe trial utilized a two-stage Bayesian design with Stage 1 enrolling 20 participants (1:1 randomization) to receive either (1) 5 mg MPH + 10 mg escitalopram or (2) placebo + 10 mg escitalopram, encapsulated together, with possible dose escalation to 20 mg escitalopram at week 4. Participants were followed for 8 weeks with in-person visits at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 8, and phone follow-ups at weeks 1, 3, and 6.\n\nThe primary endpoint was percent adherence measured by pill count. The secondary endpoint was percent of doses taken on schedule (within ±6 hours of usual time) measured by Medication Electronic Monitoring System (MEMS). Exploratory endpoints included the Beliefs About Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ), remission rates (QIDS-SR ≤5), and response rates (50% reduction in QIDS-SR scores).\n\nMethylphenidate was selected based on its mechanism as a monoaminergic reuptake inhibitor that blocks dopamine reuptake transporters and increases dopamine and norepinephrine availability. Unlike amphetamines or cocaine, MPH has relatively weak reinforcing properties and lower abuse liability. It has been used successfully in treating ADHD and has shown benefits in cognitive symptoms following brain injury.\n\nThe Bayesian statistical approach allowed for continuous evaluation of treatment effects using informative and weakly informative priors, with planned interim analysis to determine study continuation. Linear mixed-effects models evaluated treatment effects on adherence outcomes controlling for visit effects and treatment-by-visit interactions. Stage 2 (planned 80 additional participants) was not completed as Stage 1 results showed effects opposite to the hypothesis with low posterior probabilities (<25%) that MPH was superior to placebo.""}","{""conditions"": [""Major Depressive Disorder"", ""Depression, Moderate"", ""Depression, Severe""], ""keywords"": [""Medication Adherence"", ""Treatment Adherence"", ""Antidepressant Agents"", ""Escitalopram"", ""Methylphenidate"", ""Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors"", ""Habit Formation"", ""Reinforcement, Psychology"", ""Depression"", ""Medication Compliance"", ""Electronic Medication Monitoring"", ""Beliefs About Medicines""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Two principal study arms: (1) 5 mg placebo + 10 mg escitalopram and (2) 5 mg methylphenidate + 10 mg escitalopram, with option to escalate escitalopram dose to 20 mg at week 4 based on clinical improvement."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""QUADRUPLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Study medications were formulated into identical compound capsules.

This Phase 2a study tested iOWH032, a synthetic small molecule inhibitor of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel, as a potential antisecretory, host-directed therapeutic for cholera. Forty-seven healthy adult volunteers were experimentally infected with Vibrio cholerae El Tor Inaba strain N16961 in an inpatient setting and randomized to receive either 500 mg iOWH032 or placebo orally every 8 hours for 3 days. The study aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of iOWH032 in reducing cholera-induced diarrheal symptoms by blocking intestinal chloride and water secretion triggered by cholera toxin. This represents the first use of the cholera controlled human infection model to test a therapeutic candidate."", ""detailedDescription"": ""Cholera is an acute secretory diarrheal disease caused by infection with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. The disease is mediated by cholera toxin, which activates the CFTR chloride channel in intestinal epithelial cells, leading to hypersecretion of chloride and water into the intestinal tract. This results in severe, potentially fatal dehydrating diarrhea if untreated. Current treatments include oral rehydration therapy and antibiotics such as doxycycline and azithromycin, but antibiotic resistance is an increasing threat. Host-directed antisecretory drugs represent an alternative therapeutic strategy.\n\niOWH032 is a synthetic small molecule CFTR inhibitor containing an oxadiazole-carboxamide core with a dibromo-hydroxyphenyl pharmacophore. In preclinical studies, it inhibited CFTR with an IC50 of approximately 5 μM (2,725 ng/mL), blocked cholera toxin-induced intestinal secretion by more than 90% in a mouse closed-loop model, and reduced cholera toxin-induced fecal output by nearly 70% in a cecectomized rat model. iOWH032 demonstrated an acceptable safety profile in toxicology studies and Phase 1 clinical trials.\n\nThis Phase 2a study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, group-sequential trial conducted in two cohorts. Participants were challenged with 10^6 colony-forming units of V. cholerae and then randomized 1:1 to receive iOWH032 or placebo, stratified by blood type (O versus non-O). Treatment started at diarrhea onset or 48 hours post-challenge, whichever came first. The primary efficacy endpoint was diarrheal stool output rate, defined as total volume of diarrheal stools divided by hours between study drug initiation and antibiotic therapy initiation. Secondary endpoints included diarrheal disease severity, time to first formed stool, number of loose stools, and microbiological parameters. All participants received a 3-day course of ciprofloxacin starting at day 4 post-challenge or earlier if meeting severe cholera criteria.\n\nThe study found that iOWH032 was generally safe and achieved mean plasma levels of 4,270 ng/mL (±2,170) after 3 days of dosing. However, the median diarrheal stool output rate for the iOWH032 group was 25.4 mL/hour (95% CI: 8.9, 58.3) compared to 32.6 mL/hour (95% CI: 15.8, 48.2) for placebo, a non-significant 23% reduction. No significant differences were observed in secondary endpoints including diarrhea severity, number of stools, time to first formed stool, or need for intravenous fluids.

The trial included two treatment regimens: regimen M (afatinib + TMZ + RT) for patients with methylated MGMT promoters, and regimen U (afatinib + RT) for patients with unmethylated MGMT promoters.

Amplification or overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene occurs in approximately 40% and 60% of patients with GBM, respectively. Afatinib is an irreversible ErbB family blocker that targets EGFR (ErbB1), HER2 (ErbB2), and ErbB4, offering a broader inhibitory profile than first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and demonstrating potential for central nervous system penetration.\n\nThis phase I trial employed a 3+3 dose-escalation design at five sites in the United Kingdom. Eligible patients were aged ≥18 and <70 years with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed WHO grade 4 malignant glioma and known MGMT gene promoter methylation status. Patients received RT (2 Gy per fraction, 5 days per week for 6 weeks, total dose 60 Gy) in combination with afatinib at escalating doses (20, 30, or 40 mg/day) during the RT phase (days 1-42), followed by maintenance afatinib at 40 mg/day. In regimen M, patients also received TMZ 75 mg/m² daily during the RT phase, followed by up to six 28-day cycles of TMZ (150 mg/m² in cycle 1, 200 mg/m² in cycles 2-6, days 1-5 of each cycle).\n\nThe primary endpoint was MTD, defined as the highest afatinib dose at which no more than one of six patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the RT phase. Secondary endpoints included safety (assessed via adverse events graded by CTCAE v3.0), objective tumor response rate (evaluated by investigator assessment using Macdonald criteria via gadolinium-enhanced MRI), and afatinib pharmacokinetics. Post hoc analysis examined time to disease progression.\n\nFifty-five patients were enrolled; 36 received at least one dose of trial medication (regimen M, n=20; regimen U, n=16). The MTD was determined as afatinib 30 mg/day in combination with daily TMZ and RT (regimen M), and afatinib 40 mg/day in combination with RT alone (regimen U). The most frequently reported adverse events were diarrhea, rash, and nausea/fatigue, consistent with the known safety profile of afatinib. Of evaluable patients, five (25%) receiving regimen M and one (6%) receiving regimen U achieved an objective response. Median time to disease progression was 434 days (95% CI 205-NA) for regimen M and 211 days (95% CI 101-NA) for regimen U. Pharmacokinetic profiles were consistent with previous afatinib monotherapy studies. The study concluded that afatinib in combination with RT, with or without TMZ, has a manageable safety profile in patients with newly diagnosed GBM, and future studies should incorporate biomarker-based patient preselection, particularly for EGFR aberrations.""}","{""conditions"": [""Glioblastoma Multiforme"", ""Malignant Glioma"", ""Grade 4 Glioma"", ""Brain Neoplasms"", ""Central Nervous System Neoplasms""], ""keywords"": [""Glioblastoma"", ""GBM"", ""Afatinib"", ""ErbB inhibitor"", ""EGFR"", ""Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor"", ""Radiotherapy"", ""Temozolomide"", ""MGMT methylation status"", ""O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase"", ""Phase I trial"", ""Dose-escalation study"", ""Maximum tolerated dose"", ""Newly diagnosed glioma"", ""Biomarker-driven therapy"", ""Tyrosine kinase inhibitor""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""PHASE1""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""NON_RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""This was a phase I, open-label, 3 + 3 dose-escalation trial in patients with newly-diagnosed malignant glioma.

The MenABCWY vaccine contains components of licensed vaccines against meningococcal serogroup B (4CMenB) and serogroups ACWY (MenACWY). A total of 500 participants were randomly assigned to one of five study groups: four groups received two doses 2 months apart of MenABCWY, 4CMenB plus MenACWY administered concomitantly in the same arm, 4CMenB plus MenACWY in different arms, or 4CMenB alone; a fifth group received a single MenACWY dose. The study was primarily designed to assess potential immunological interference between vaccine components against pooled serogroup B test strains. Results showed no evidence of substantial immunological interference between 4CMenB and MenACWY vaccine components against serogroup B, with acceptable safety and tolerability profiles for the investigational MenABCWY vaccine."", ""detailedDescription"": ""Neisseria meningitidis is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis and sepsis, with six meningococcal serogroups (A, B, C, W, X, and Y) accounting for most cases of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) worldwide. The quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine MenACWY-CRM (Menveo) provides protection against serogroups A, C, W, and Y, while the four-component meningococcal serogroup B vaccine 4CMenB (Bexsero) targets serogroup B. An investigational vaccine (MenABCWY) combining MenACWY and 4CMenB antigens is being developed to provide protection against five serogroups and simplify the vaccination schedule. Previous studies showed the MenABCWY vaccine was immunogenic with an acceptable safety profile, although immune responses against serogroup B test strains were overall higher in participants who received 4CMenB alone compared to those who received MenABCWY.\n\nThis phase 2 randomized study was conducted to assess if there is immune interference when two doses of the MenABCWY vaccine are administered 2 months apart. A total of 500 healthy 10- to 25-year-old participants were enrolled and randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to five study groups: MenABCWY (n=100), 4CMenB plus MenACWY administered concomitantly in the same arm (4CMenB+ACWY/S, n=104), 4CMenB plus MenACWY in different arms (4CMenB+ACWY/D, n=100), 4CMenB alone (n=94), or a single dose of MenACWY (n=102). The study was powered to assess immunological interference against pooled serogroup B test strains.\n\nImmunogenicity was measured by serum bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA) against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y and serogroup B test strains representing major antigens (fHbp, NadA, PorA, NHBA). One month after the second vaccine dose, hSBA geometric mean titers (GMTs) against pooled serogroup B strains were 31.84, 38.48, 40.08, and 42.38 in the MenABCWY, 4CMenB+ACWY/S, 4CMenB+ACWY/D, and 4CMenB groups, respectively. The ratio of GMTs (4CMenB+ACWY/S versus 4CMenB+ACWY/D) was 0.96 (80% CI, 0.83 to 1.10), indicating no statistically significant difference and suggesting no substantial immunological interference when vaccines were administered in the same versus different arms. Immune responses against individual serogroup B test strains for PorA and NHBA antigens were lower in the MenABCWY group compared to the 4CMenB+ACWY/D and 4CMenB groups.\n\nSafety and reactogenicity were assessed through solicited local and systemic adverse events (AEs) for 7 days post-vaccination and unsolicited AEs for 30 days post-vaccination. At least one solicited local AE was reported by 90.0-97.1% of participants after each dose in groups receiving two doses and 57.8% in the MenACWY group. The most frequent solicited local AE was pain at the injection site (87.0-96.2% after each dose). Solicited systemic AEs were reported by 62.5-71.0% of participants after each dose, with fatigue and headache being most common. Most solicited AEs were mild to moderate in severity. Unsolicited AEs were reported by 14.7-26.0% of participants during the 30-day follow-up period. Five serious AEs were reported in five participants, with one case of syncope considered related to vaccination. No deaths occurred during the study, and no safety concerns were identified.\n\nIn conclusion, administration of two doses of MenABCWY does not appear to be associated with substantial immunological interference for pooled serogroup B test strains.

Smoking cessation interventions delivered by smartphone apps are a promising tool for helping smokers quit. However, currently available smartphone apps for smoking cessation have not exploited their unique potential advantages to aid quitting. Notably, few to no available apps use wearable technologies, most apps require users to self-report their smoking, and few to no apps deliver treatment automatically contingent upon smoking. This pilot trial tests the feasibility of using a smartband and smartphone to monitor and detect smoking and deliver brief mindfulness interventions in real time to reduce smoking."", ""detailedDescription"": ""Daily smokers (N=100, ≥5 cigarettes per day) wear a smartband for 60 days to monitor and detect smoking, notify them about their smoking events in real time, and deliver real-time brief mindfulness exercises triggered by detected smoking events or targeted at predicted smoking events. Smokers set a quit date at 30 days. A three-step intervention to reduce smoking is tested. First, participants wear a smartband to monitor and detect smoking, and notify them of smoking events in real time to bring awareness to smoking and triggers for 21 days. Next, a \""mindful smoking\"" exercise is triggered by detected smoking events to bring a clear recognition of the actual effects of smoking for 7 days. Finally, after their quit date, a \""RAIN\"" (recognize, allow, investigate, nonidentification) exercise is delivered to predicted smoking events (based on the initial 3 weeks of tracking smoking data) to help smokers learn to work mindfully with cravings rather than smoke for 30 days. The primary outcomes are feasibility measures of treatment fidelity, adherence, and acceptability. The secondary outcomes are smoking rates at end of treatment. Findings will provide data and information on the feasibility of using a smartband and smartphone to monitor and detect smoking and deliver real-time brief mindfulness interventions, and whether the intervention warrants additional testing for smoking cessation.""}","{""conditions"": [""Smoking"", ""Smoking Cessation"", ""Tobacco Use Disorder""], ""keywords"": [""Smoking"", ""Smoking cessation"", ""Mobile health"", ""mHealth"", ""Smartphone app"", ""Wearable technology"", ""Smartband"", ""Mindfulness"", ""Brief mindfulness interventions"", ""Real-time intervention"", ""Craving"", ""Nicotine dependence"", ""Mindful smoking"", ""RAIN"", ""Feasibility trial""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""NA"", ""interventionModel"": ""SINGLE_GROUP"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""All participants (N=100) will receive a smartband and smartphone app for the smartband and take part in a 60-day intervention.

GSK3358699 is a mononuclear myeloid-targeted bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family inhibitor designed to preferentially deliver a pharmacologically active acid metabolite (GSK3206944) to cells expressing human carboxyesterase-1 (CES-1), including monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. The study aimed to determine if GSK3358699 could mitigate the dose-limiting toxicities (thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal symptoms, QTc prolongation) observed with pan-BET inhibitors while maintaining immunomodulatory effects."", ""detailedDescription"": ""The study comprised multiple parts. Part A (N=23) included three dose-escalating periods (1-40 mg GSK3358699 or placebo) in two interlocking cohorts using a single ascending-dose crossover design. Each participant received a maximum of two single doses of GSK3358699 and one dose of placebo. Part C (N=25) was designed as an initial dose of 10 mg GSK3358699 or placebo daily for 14 days in four sequential cohorts. Part B (food effect evaluation) was not conducted.\n\nThe study evaluated systemic and intracellular pharmacokinetics of GSK3358699 and its metabolite GSK3206944, with blood samples collected at multiple timepoints for plasma and monocyte analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Pharmacodynamic assessments included ex vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated whole blood to measure inhibition of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production. Safety assessments included adverse event monitoring, clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, vital signs, cardiac telemetry, and 12-lead ECGs.\n\nResults showed that single doses of GSK3358699 were generally well tolerated up to 40 mg. Exposure to GSK3358699 and GSK3206944 increased with increasing doses, though the increase in AUC was greater than dose-proportional. The median initial half-life ranged from 0.7-1.1 hours (GSK3358699) and 2.1-2.9 hours (GSK3206944). Intracellular GSK3206944 concentrations in monocytes were quantifiable at 1-hour post-dose following 10 mg GSK3358699 and at 1 and 4 hours following 20-40 mg doses. Mean predicted percentage inhibition of ex vivo LPS-induced MCP-1 reached 75% with 40 mg GSK3358699, but GSK3358699 did not inhibit IL-6 or TNF. The most common adverse event was headache. However, four adverse events of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) were observed across parts A and C, and one serious adverse event of atrial fibrillation (part C) required hospitalization. Following a comprehensive benefit-risk assessment including emerging preclinical cardiac toxicity data from 3-month cynomolgus monkey studies (troponin elevations with cardiac histopathology), a causal relationship could not be excluded for cardiac-related adverse events.

This nested qualitative study involved semi-structured interviews with 37 participants randomized to XR-NTX across five HIV clinics between 2018 and 2019. Of these, 20 successfully completed XR-NTX induction and 17 did not.\n\nParticipants included 43% women, 62% African Americans, and 16% Hispanics, aged 27 to 69 years. All eligible participants with moderate or severe OUD and HIV viral RNA ≥200 copies/ml who were approached for interviews agreed to participate. Interviews were conducted either face-to-face or by telephone, lasting 20-40 minutes, and covered topics including participant characteristics, HIV care history, substance use history, treatment history, social supports, and views on OUD medications, particularly withdrawal and induction experiences.\n\nUsing thematic analysis within a Constructivist paradigm, three key themes emerged among participants who successfully completed induction: (1) readiness for change, including motivation from family, desire for life improvement, and fatigue with opioid use; (2) supportive environment during withdrawal with access to comfort medications and either inpatient medically supervised withdrawal or supportive home environments; and (3) caring interactions with study staff providing educational, operational, and emotional support.\n\nConversely, four themes emerged among participants unable to complete induction: (1) concern and anxiety about withdrawal based on past negative experiences, including fears about severity of withdrawal symptoms, inability to access inpatient facilities, and perception that transitioning directly from fentanyl or heroin was impossible; (2) ambivalence about stopping opioids, with participants not ready to cease use, valuing opioids for pain management or coping, and prioritizing other life responsibilities; (3) concerns about XR-NTX effects, including negative information received from others, fears of unmanaged pain, continued cravings, overdose risk, or increased stimulant use; and (4) preferences for other medications, particularly when participants had beneficial prior experiences with buprenorphine or methadone.\n\nThe study found that inpatient medically managed withdrawal provided advantages through supportive medications and removal from use environments. Patient preference and motivation significantly influenced treatment initiation success. The findings highlight the need for enhanced strategies including aggressive advance treatment of withdrawal symptoms, patient education about XR-NTX mechanisms and expectations, shared decision-making respecting patient preferences, and improved access to supportive withdrawal management settings.""}","{""conditions"": [""HIV"", ""Opioid Use Disorder"", ""Opioid-Related Disorders""], ""keywords"": [""Extended-release naltrexone"", ""XR-NTX"", ""Opioid use disorder"", ""HIV"", ""Medication induction"", ""Opioid withdrawal"", ""Medications for opioid use disorder"", ""MOUD"", ""Treatment barriers"", ""Qualitative research"", ""Patient experiences"", ""Buprenorphine"", ""Methadone"", ""Naltrexone"", ""Substance use disorder treatment""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""PHASE3""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""The CHOICES study randomized participants with HIV and opioid use disorder (OUD) to HIV clinic-based extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) versus treatment-as-usual (i.e., buprenorphine, methadone)."", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""observationalModel"": null, ""timePerspective"": null, ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""This was an open-label randomized trial comparing extended-release naltrexone to treatment-as-usual with opioid agonist therapy."", ""whoMasked"": []}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 55, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Extended-Release Naltrexone (XR-NTX)"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Participants with HIV and opioid use disorder randomized to receive HIV clinic-based extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), which requires complete cessation of opioid use prior to induction.

Using a novel phage-display-based method called AllerScan, researchers mapped the epitope targets of peanut-specific antibodies with high resolution. The study analyzed sera from 15 peanut-allergic participants in the PRROTECT clinical trial before (week 0) and after (week 52) OIT, as well as samples from 54 non-allergic control donors. The hypothesis is that OIT induces protective IgG responses that overlap with pre-existing IgE specificities, which may explain the mechanism of desensitization."", ""detailedDescription"": ""Peanut allergy is a major public health concern that can result in life-threatening anaphylactic reactions. Oral immunotherapy (OIT) has emerged as a promising treatment approach that involves administering gradually increasing doses of peanut allergen to induce desensitization. However, the mechanisms underlying successful OIT remain incompletely understood. This study develops and applies AllerScan, a phage immunoprecipitation sequencing method that leverages phage-display and next-generation sequencing to comprehensively identify and map IgE and IgG epitopes within peanut allergens at single amino acid resolution.\n\nThe AllerScan library consists of 397 20-mer peptides tiling across all 12 WHO/IUIS-listed peanut allergen proteins, including genetic and splice variants, as well as saturation mutagenesis versions of each peptide. This design enables high-resolution mapping of critical residues within antibody epitopes. Sera were analyzed from participants in PRROTECT, a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled study of oral peanut desensitization under cover of omalizumab (anti-IgE) in highly allergic subjects.\n\nKey findings include: (1) identification of highly shared public epitopes in Ara h 1, 2, 3, and 7 recognized by IgE in up to 87% of allergic patients; (2) striking diversification and boosting of peanut-specific IgG repertoire after OIT, with patients recognizing an average of 15 peptides post-OIT compared to 7 pre-OIT; (3) reduction in pre-existing epitope-specific IgE levels during OIT; (4) extensive overlap between OIT-induced IgG specificities and pre-existing IgE repertoires, with remarkably similar antibody footprints suggesting clonal relationships or convergent evolution; (5) marked induction of Ara h 7-specific IgG by OIT, with 12/15 patients developing these responses post-treatment.\n\nHigh-resolution epitope mapping through saturation mutagenesis reveals that different allergic individuals often recognize the same epitopes with highly similar critical residue patterns, suggesting structural and sequence similarity of public epitope-specific antibodies. The study demonstrates that AllerScan provides a powerful tool for investigating antibody repertoires in allergic subjects and tracking their evolution during immunotherapy. These findings suggest that individual differences in epitope recognition identified via AllerScan could inform safer and more effective personalized immunotherapy approaches, potentially through peptide vaccines targeting missing public epitopes to elicit protective IgG responses without triggering IgE-mediated reactions.""}","{""conditions"": [""Peanut Allergy"", ""Food Hypersensitivity"", ""Immediate Hypersensitivity"", ""Anaphylaxis""], ""keywords"": [""Oral immunotherapy"", ""OIT"", ""Immunoglobulin E"", ""IgE"", ""Immunoglobulin G"", ""IgG"", ""Epitope mapping"", ""Phage display"", ""AllerScan"", ""Peanut allergens"", ""Ara h 1"", ""Ara h 2"", ""Ara h 3"", ""Ara h 7"", ""Desensitization"", ""B cell repertoire"", ""Antibody footprints"", ""Saturation mutagenesis"", ""Food allergy"", ""Personalized immunotherapy"", ""Public epitopes""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Multicenter randomized placebo-controlled study of oral peanut desensitization under cover of anti-IgE (omalizumab).

The study assessed feasibility outcomes (recruitment, retention, engagement, satisfaction) and health outcomes (daily weight monitoring, physical activity, functional status, quality of life, HF knowledge, self-care behaviors, self-efficacy, motivation, and hospitalizations)."", ""detailedDescription"": ""Heart failure (HF) remains a leading cause of hospitalization among older adults, with poor self-management contributing to adverse health outcomes. Daily weight monitoring and physical activity are critical HF self-management behaviors that can prevent exacerbations and improve quality of life, yet adherence to these behaviors remains poor due to lack of motivation and knowledge.\n\nThis feasibility randomized controlled trial (1:1 allocation) compared an innovative sensor-controlled digital game (SCDG) intervention with a sensors-only control intervention. The SCDG, called Heart Health Mountain, was designed based on the Fogg Behavioral Model and synchronized with Bluetooth-enabled activity trackers and weighing scales to provide game-based motivation, education, rewards, and personalized feedback based on participants' real-time behaviors.\n\nEnglish-speaking adults aged 55 years or older with New York Heart Association class II or III HF who owned smartphones and could walk unassisted were recruited from Texas and Oklahoma between November 2019 and August 2020. Recruitment occurred both in-person (pre-COVID-19) at clinical sites and remotely (during COVID-19) via secure online methods and a recruitment company. All participants received Withings Go activity trackers, Withings Body smart weighing scales, and the Withings Health Mate app to record and transmit behavioral data. The intervention group additionally received the SCDG app on their smartphones, which included embedded HF education, game mechanics (narrative, rewards, challenges, feedback), and real-time behavioral triggers. The control group received the same HF education in written format but no gaming elements.\n\nThe 12-week intervention phase measured objective behaviors (daily weight monitoring and physical activity steps) via sensor data transmitted to a Google Cloud console. Feasibility outcomes included recruitment rates, retention at 12 and 24 weeks, intervention engagement (days of SCDG use), and satisfaction assessed via surveys and open-ended questions. Health outcomes were measured at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 weeks using validated instruments including the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (functional status and quality of life), Atlanta Heart Failure Knowledge Test, European Heart Failure Self-care Behavior Scale, Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (self-efficacy), Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire (motivation), and self-reported HF hospitalizations.\n\nA total of 38 participants enrolled (19 intervention, 19 control), with 31 (82%) completing the 12-week behavioral assessment and 27 (71%) completing the 24-week follow-up. Among intervention participants who installed the app (15/19, 79%), game engagement was strongly correlated with weight monitoring (r=0.72, p=0.04) and physical activity (r=0.9, p<0.001). Satisfaction surveys indicated the SCDG was easy to use, motivating, and educational. Trends of improvement were observed in the intervention group for daily weight monitoring (medium effect size of 0.53) and physical activity compared to control. Both groups showed within-group improvements in functional status, quality of life, HF knowledge, self-efficacy, and reductions in HF hospitalization, possibly reflecting benefits of digital health monitoring overall.\n\nThis feasibility study demonstrates that an SCDG intervention integrating real-time sensor data with game mechanics is feasible, acceptable, and shows promising trends for improving HF self-management behaviors in older adults.

Trial 1 enrolled pregnant women who had an HIV-positive test result documented in their antenatal record; Trial 2 enrolled women who had an HIV-negative test result documented in their antenatal record within the past 3 months during the current pregnancy. Women in both trials were randomly assigned (1:1) to intervention or control groups using permuted block randomisation.\n\nControl groups in both trials received partner notification services only, including an adapted version for women who were HIV-negative. These services included four options for male partner HIV testing: client self-referral, provider contract referral, provider referral, and dual referral. Intervention groups additionally received targeted education on the use of oral HIV self-test kits (OraQuick) for their partners, along with up to five oral HIV self-test kits. All participants were offered these interventions at enrolment and were counseled that facility-based HIV testing by a healthcare provider was recommended regardless of study group allocation. This included confirmatory HIV testing at a healthcare facility for those who first tested at home or in the community.\n\nThe primary outcome was the proportion of primary male partners reported to have tested for HIV at a health facility within 30 days of participant enrolment. A prespecified secondary outcome was the proportion of primary male partners reported to have HIV testing of any kind (including HIV self-testing in the household and other community-based venues) within 30 days of randomisation. At the 30-day follow-up visit, information was collected from pregnant women about their primary male partner's HIV testing, including date, modality, and venue. Screening for intimate partner violence and social harms was also conducted at follow-up.\n\nFrom October 28, 2019, to May 26, 2020, 116 women who were HIV-positive (trial 1) and 210 women who were HIV-negative (trial 2) were enrolled and randomly assigned to study groups. Retention at 30 days was 100 (86%) in trial 1 and 200 (95%) in trial 2.

Eligible participants were adults aged 18 years and older with polymerase chain reaction confirmed covid-19 at enrolment, presenting with at least one of the following respiratory symptoms: fever, cough (wet or dry), or shortness of breath (including dyspnoea, chest congestion, or chest tightness). Exclusion criteria included hospital admission, having only non-respiratory symptoms, or already being prescribed an inhaled steroid. Participants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either inhaled ciclesonide (600 μg twice daily) and intranasal ciclesonide (200 μg daily) or matching placebos (saline metered dose inhaler and intranasal saline) for 14 days.

Secondary endpoints included absolute changes in pustule counts and the proportion of subjects achieving at least a 50% reduction in pustule counts. Exploratory endpoints included PPPASI-50 response rates and plasma concentrations of RIST4721."", ""detailedDescription"": ""Palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) is a rare, chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by sterile pustules with erythema, hyperkeratosis, scaling, pruritus, pain, and/or burning sensation on the palms and soles. The condition is debilitating and significantly impacts quality of life. PPP is commonly diagnosed in females between 40 and 69 years of age and in current or former smokers. The pathobiology of PPP involves neutrophil recruitment, potentially mediated by human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (hCAP-18) and its processed forms, which upregulate pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-8, IL-23, IL-17C, IL-1α, and IL-1β in keratinocytes. IL-8 is particularly implicated in neutrophil migration and activation. Currently, there are no approved treatments for PPP in the USA, Canada, or the European Union. Off-label treatments include topical corticosteroids, calcipotriene, phototherapy, and systemic therapies such as acitretin, cyclosporine, and biologic agents targeting IL-23 or IL-17, though these have limited efficacy and may cause significant side effects.\n\nRIST4721 is a potent CXCR2 antagonist with 134-fold and 47-fold greater selectivity for CXCR2 than CXCR1 and CCR2b, respectively. By blocking CXCR2 ligands including IL-8, RIST4721 prevents neutrophil migration to sites of inflammation without affecting neutrophil activation due to minimal activity on CXCR1. The on-target effect of RIST4721 results in a reduction of absolute neutrophil count (ANC), which is dose-dependent and reversible. Prior phase 1 studies demonstrated that RIST4721 is generally well tolerated with reversible reductions in ANC.\n\nThis phase 2a study enrolled 35 subjects with moderate to severe PPP at 17 sites across Canada (12 sites) and Germany (5 sites). Key eligibility criteria included age 18-70 years, at least a 6-month history of PPP, PPPASI ≥ 8, PPPGA ≥ 3 at day -1, and a minimum of 8 fresh pustules at screening and 20 fresh pustules at day -1. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to RIST4721 300 mg or placebo once daily for 28 days, with randomization stratified by consent to skin biopsy collection. The study duration included an up to 30-day screening period, 1 day for eligibility confirmation and randomization, a 28-day treatment period, and a 14-day follow-up period.\n\nEfficacy assessments included fresh and total pustule counts, PPPASI, PPPGA, Palmoplantar Pustulosis Severity Index (PPSI), pain visual analogue scale (VAS), and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at baseline and study visits. Blood samples for RIST4721 plasma concentrations were collected on days 7 and 21 from consenting subjects. Safety was assessed through physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms, clinical laboratory tests, and adverse event monitoring.\n\nThirty-four subjects received at least one dose of study drug (15 RIST4721, 19 placebo). The mean baseline fresh pustule count was 33.5 ± 17.99, and total pustule count was 92.8 ± 76.88. The majority of subjects (82.4%) were female, and 73.5% were current smokers. At day 28, the mean relative change from baseline in fresh pustule count was 0.86 ± 0.692 for RIST4721 and 0.53 ± 0.561 for placebo (P=0.240), and in total pustule count was 0.99 ± 0.667 and 0.96 ± 0.672, respectively (P=0.804). No statistically significant differences were observed for primary efficacy endpoints.\n\nRIST4721 was generally well tolerated, with TEAEs occurring in 86.7% of RIST4721-treated subjects (predominantly mild gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal disorders) compared to 36.8% in placebo. Mean ANC decreased from 4.041 ± 1.1703 10E9/l at baseline to 2.499 ± 0.9059 10E9/l at day 28 in the RIST4721 group but remained within the reference range. Two subjects experienced mild, transient, asymptomatic neutropenia that resolved without treatment discontinuation. No serious adverse events or deaths were reported.\n\nPost hoc analysis of subjects with progressing disease (defined as an increase in total pustule count between screening and baseline) demonstrated that 71% of RIST4721-treated subjects achieved PPPASI-50 at day 28 compared to 15% on placebo (P=0.022), suggesting potential efficacy in preventing or blocking PPP flares. These findings indicate that RIST4721 may be effective in patients with active, progressing disease. Further studies with longer treatment durations and standardized entry criteria are warranted to confirm these preliminary findings.""}","{""conditions"": [""Palmoplantar Pustulosis"", ""PPP"", ""Chronic Inflammatory Skin Disease""], ""keywords"": [""Palmoplantar pustulosis"", ""PPP"", ""CXCR2 antagonist"", ""RIST4721"", ""Neutrophil recruitment"", ""IL-8"", ""PPPASI"", ""PPPGA"", ""Pustules"", ""Chronic inflammatory skin disease"", ""Palms and soles"", ""Sterile pustules"", ""Neutrophilic infiltration"", ""CXC chemokine receptor type 2"", ""Quality of life"", ""Smoking"", ""Dermatology""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE2""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either RIST4721 300 mg or placebo solution administered orally once daily for 28 days"", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""DOUBLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

This study uses a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design to rigorously evaluate an adaptive, trauma-informed, culturally tailored technology-delivered intervention tailored to the needs of immigrant women who have experienced IPV. In the first stage randomization, participants are randomly assigned to an online safety decision and planning intervention (culturally adapted myPlan) or a usual care control arm and safety, mental health and empowerment outcomes are assessed at 3-, 6- and 12-months post-baseline. For the second stage randomization, women who do not report significant improvements in safety (i.e., reduction in IPV) and empowerment from baseline to 3 months follow up (i.e., non-responders) are re-randomized to safety and empowerment strategies delivered via text only or a combination of text and phone calls with trained advocates. Data on outcomes (safety, mental health, and empowerment) for early non-responders is assessed at 6 and 12 months post re-randomization. The study hypothesizes that immigrant women who receive the intervention will show greater improvements in safety, mental health, and empowerment outcomes compared to those receiving usual care, and that adding text messaging and phone interventions will improve outcomes among non-responders."", ""detailedDescription"": ""The weWomen Plus intervention is an adaptive technology-based trauma-informed culturally tailored intervention designed to reduce the risk of future IPV or homicide, improve mental health and increase empowerment of immigrant women in abusive relationships. The intervention consists of three components: (1) an online/web-based safety decision and planning tool (culturally adapted myPlan app), (2) text messaging intervention, and (3) phone call intervention.\n\nThe culturally adapted myPlan app is delivered through a free and secure web-based application. It is based on Dutton's empowerment model to facilitate protection, decision-making, and healing from negative health and social effects of IPV. The app includes an on-boarding section on safe technology use, privacy information, and secure password creation. Users receive an initial safety plan with general strategies, then complete additional sections to tailor the plan to their specific situation. This includes identifying \""red flags\"" of unhealthy relationships, completing the Danger Assessment (DA) validated for immigrant women which categorizes danger levels, and a priority-setting activity considering needs and values. An evidence-based algorithm combines user inputs to create a tailored safety plan with links to local and national resources.\n\nThe text messaging intervention is based on a strengths-based empowerment framework and psychosocial readiness model. Tailored weekly messages are sent once a week for 4 weeks at preferred safe days and times. Week 1 assesses current feelings of safety, readiness for safety actions, past use of safety strategies and barriers, and provides information on safety plan elements and resources. Week 2 assesses current safety feelings, formal and informal support resources, helpfulness of prior suggestions, need for additional resources, and provides self-care tips. Week 3 assesses danger level using self-perception and potentially the short form DA, identifies safety risks of greatest concern, and provides safety plan messages, self-care strategies, and service referrals. Week 4 focuses on safety goals regardless of relationship status and provides additional community resources. All text sessions use empathetic tone, enhance self-worth, emphasize self-care, and end with emergency resources and safety reminders.\n\nThe phone intervention uses trauma-informed empowerment-focused approaches including strengths-based perspective, motivational enhancement, and solution-focused techniques. Two phone calls occur 1 week apart after the text intervention ends. The first call establishes trust, discusses primary concerns, emphasizes accomplishments, reframes negative thoughts to strengths, uses scaling questions to build motivation, elicits change talks, identifies modifiable changes within women's control, and develops mutually identified attainable goals reflecting women's priorities. The second call discusses steps taken towards goals, barriers, exceptions, general and culturally specific strengths, personal and community resources, and reinforces goals and strategies. Safety assessment is part of both sessions.\n\nThe study uses a SMART design with two stages of randomization. First stage: women are randomized to receive the online/web-based culturally adapted myPlan intervention or usual care control. Responders (those showing reduced violence severity/frequency or improved empowerment at 3 months) continue in their originally assigned arms. Second stage: non-responders (those not showing both reduced IPV and improved empowerment at 3 months) from both intervention and control arms are re-randomized to receive either text messaging alone or a combination of text messaging and phone intervention.\n\nOutcome measures include: Primary outcomes - (1) Severity and frequency of IPV measured by adapted Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2) with subscales for physical aggression, injury, psychological aggression, and sexual coercion; (2) Empowerment measured by Personal Progress Scale-Revised (PPS-R) for overall empowerment and Measure of Victim Empowerment Related to Safety (MOVERS) for safety-specific empowerment. Secondary outcomes include depression measured by Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and PTSD measured by Harvard Trauma Questionnaire. Outcomes are assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months post-baseline.\n\nThe control condition receives usual safety planning resources modeled on national and state domestic violence online resources without the DA or DA-informed tailored safety planning, but with standard safety planning information based on formative work identifying additional risk factors for immigrant women.\n\nRecruitment occurs nationally through immigrant-specific service providers, health clinics, IPV support agencies, listservs, and social media platforms. Eligibility criteria include: age 18-64 years; identify as woman; been in intimate relationship in past 12 months; experienced IPV (physical, sexual or psychological) in past 12 months; foreign-born immigrant living in US; access to safe computer or smartphone; willing to be contacted by phone or text. Data collection occurs through web-based or smartphone application-based questionnaire using Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS).\n\nThe study has robust retention procedures including compensation ($40 per survey, total $160), automated email reminders, monthly check-ins between assessments, and collection of alternate safe contacts. Safety protocols include comprehensive training for all team members, secure data management with code numbers and separate storage of identifiers, use of username/password/pin for accessing surveys, safety instructions for technology use, preferred method and timing for contacts, periodic safety check-ins, established suicide protocol, adverse event reporting to DSMB and IRB, and protection of data privacy through SSL encryption and restricted access. A Data Safety Monitoring Board comprised of three independent experts monitors safety and adherence to protocols at 6-month intervals.""}","{""conditions"": [""Intimate Partner Violence"", ""Domestic Violence"", ""Violence Against Women"", ""Depression"", ""Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder"", ""Psychological Trauma""], ""keywords"": [""Intimate Partner Violence"", ""Immigrant Women"", ""Foreign-Born Women"", ""Safety Planning"", ""Empowerment"", ""Technology-Based Intervention"", ""Web-Based Intervention"", ""Mobile Health"", ""Text Messaging"", ""Telephone Intervention"", ""Trauma-Informed Care"", ""Culturally Tailored Intervention"", ""SMART Design"", ""Adaptive Intervention"", ""Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial"", ""Mental Health"", ""Depression"", ""Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder"", ""PTSD"", ""Danger Assessment"", ""myPlan"", ""Domestic Violence"", ""Violence Against Women"", ""Health Disparities"", ""Immigrant Health"", ""Underserved Populations""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""SEQUENTIAL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""This study uses a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design.

The primary outcome is patient-level Choosing Wisely compliance, with secondary outcomes measuring intervention component activation rates and provider interaction with the BE-EHR module."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This pragmatic, investigator-blind, cluster randomized controlled trial aims to test the effectiveness of a previously developed, iteratively refined, user-tested, and pilot-tested BE-EHR module for promoting appropriate diabetes care in elderly adults compared to usual care. The study will randomize 66 eligible New York University Langone Health (NYULH) primary care and endocrinology clinics across the greater New York City area and 2 sites in Florida to 1 of 2 groups: (1) BE-EHR module intervention plus standard care or (2) standard care only. Clinics will be stratified by practice size (measured by the number of eligible patients with encounters in 2019) and location (Manhattan/Brooklyn versus other locations). The study leverages NYULH's Epic electronic health record system for patient inclusion and intervention delivery. Eligible patients must be aged ≥76 years with type 2 diabetes as defined in the patient's problem list or encounter diagnosis within the EHR. Exclusion criteria include not taking diabetes medication, metformin allergy, and estimated glomerular filtration rate <30. Clinicians at intervention-arm clinics will receive the BE-EHR module components during eligible patient encounters or according to a monthly dissemination schedule. The 6-component BE-EHR module includes: (1) Tailored Advisory: a noninterruptive alert describing appropriate treatment guidelines based on life expectancy category; (2) Refill Protocol: an alert during medication refills suggesting metformin or dose adjustments; (3) Preference List: automatic default display of metformin at the top of diabetes medication lists; (4) Lab Result: an alert with treatment guidelines when new HbA1c results are available; (5) Peer Comparison: monthly emails with graphics comparing the clinician's Choosing Wisely compliance to their practice site and all NYULH practices; and (6) Campaign: monthly game show-themed animations and flashcards promoting Choosing Wisely awareness. Each component utilizes behavioral economics principles such as framing, social norming, suggesting alternatives, affirmation, emotional appeal, accountable justification, defaults, peer comparisons, and gamification. Patients are categorized into high, medium, or low life expectancy groups using an algorithm that incorporates age, gender, and comorbidity burden. Choosing Wisely compliance is determined by comparing HbA1c levels to target ranges appropriate for each life expectancy category. The primary outcome is patient-level Choosing Wisely compliance, measured using a 3-level logistic mixed-effects model accounting for patients nested within providers nested within clinics. Secondary outcomes include activation rates of intervention components, provider interaction with the module (clicks, workflow sequences), and email read receipts. The study commenced on December 7, 2020, and will run for 18 months, potentially extended if COVID-19 affects patient visit activity.

BRAF V600E/K mutation status was determined on archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue and pretreatment stored frozen plasma samples. Tissue DNA was analyzed using a clinical 50-gene hotspot PCR-based next-generation sequencing panel.

Patients who failed asparaginase-based therapy have limited treatment options with a median survival of less than 6 months. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is an important etiological and prognostic factor for ENKTL. Overexpression of PD-L1 induced by EBV infection is a potential mechanism for ENKTL to avert immune surveillance. Sintilimab is a recombinant humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody that binds to human PD-1 with potentially greater affinity compared to pembrolizumab or nivolumab according to preclinical data. This prospective phase 2 study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sintilimab against r/r ENKTL. Eligible patients received sintilimab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until progressive disease, death, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of informed consent, up to 24 months. Treatment beyond progressive disease was allowed according to the investigator's discretion. The patients were evaluated for efficacy using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography at baseline and weeks 6, 15, and 24. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography was used at baseline and weeks 24, 36, and 48 and every 24 weeks thereafter. Efficacy was assessed according to the Lugano 2014 standard. The median age of the patients was 37 years (range: 19–65), and 17 (60.7%) were male. Patients received a median of 3 (Q1–Q3, 2.0–4.5) prior lines of chemotherapy, and all were relapsed or refractory to previous asparaginase-based treatment. Most treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were grade 1–2 (71.4%), and the most common TRAE was decreased lymphocyte count (42.9%). Serious adverse events occurred in 7 (25.0%) patients, and no patient died of adverse events.

The hypothesis was that ruxolitinib could potentially disrupt the parasite-induced dysfunctional immune response in malaria when given with antimalarial therapy. Eight healthy male and female participants aged 18 to 55 years were randomized to receive either ruxolitinib (20 mg) or placebo, administered 2 hours after artemether-lumefantrine (80/480 mg) twice daily for 3 days. The study assessed adverse events, drug exposure, and the pharmacodynamic effect of ruxolitinib measured by inhibition of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3). Results showed that the combination was well tolerated, with mild adverse events consistent with the known profiles of both drugs. Ruxolitinib coadministration did not affect artemether-lumefantrine pharmacokinetics and resulted in a 3-fold greater pSTAT3 inhibition compared to placebo, with a direct and predictable relationship between ruxolitinib plasma concentrations and pSTAT3 inhibition."", ""detailedDescription"": ""Malaria remains a major global health issue, with poor understanding of host immunity against Plasmodium species being a key impediment to eradication. Evidence indicates the presence of parasite-induced immunoregulatory mechanisms that promote the development of atypical B cells, suboptimal function of CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and Tbet+ CD4+ T (Th1) cells, and interleukin-10 (IL-10) production. Type I interferons (IFNs) are important regulators of IL-10 production by Tr1 cells and signal through the common IFN-α receptor (IFNAR) via signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT). Polymorphisms in the IFNAR1 gene have been associated with increased risk of severe malaria.\n\nRuxolitinib is an orally administered small molecule inhibitor of Janus-Associated Kinase 1 (JAK1) and JAK2 approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease. Ruxolitinib has been shown to block type I IFN signaling in a range of human diseases. The potential for ruxolitinib to disrupt the parasite-induced dysfunctional immune response in malaria requires investigation. This study aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of ruxolitinib when coadministered with artemether-lumefantrine, an approved artemisinin-based combination therapy widely used for treatment of uncomplicated malaria.\n\nThis randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center phase 1 trial included eight healthy volunteers randomized to receive either ruxolitinib (20 mg, n=6) or placebo (n=2) administered 2 hours after artemether-lumefantrine (80/480 mg) twice daily for 3 days. The ruxolitinib dose of 20 mg twice daily is the standard dose for treatment of myelofibrosis. A 3-day ruxolitinib dosing regimen was considered appropriate based on reported safety and expected pSTAT3 inhibition in previous trials.\n\nThe primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability. Secondary objectives were to assess the effect on pSTAT3 inhibition and to characterize the pharmacokinetic profiles of artemether, its major metabolite dihydroartemisinin, lumefantrine, and ruxolitinib. Pharmacodynamic activity of ruxolitinib was assessed by measuring pSTAT3 inhibition using Meso Scale Discovery immunoassay kits. Blood samples were stimulated ex vivo with 100 ng/ml human IL-6 for 15 minutes. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using noncompartmental methods and the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship was examined through modeling.\n\nResults showed that all adverse events were mild, with no serious adverse events or adverse events leading to study discontinuation. The combination of artemether-lumefantrine and ruxolitinib was well tolerated, with adverse events and pharmacokinetics consistent with the known profiles of both drugs. Ruxolitinib coadministration resulted in a 3-fold greater pSTAT3 inhibition compared to placebo (geometric mean ratio = 3.01, 90% confidence interval = 2.14 to 4.24). A direct and predictable relationship was found between ruxolitinib plasma concentrations and %pSTAT3 inhibition, best described by a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model and a simple direct effect sigmoidal Emax model. These findings support further investigation of the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and ruxolitinib in healthy volunteers infected with Plasmodium falciparum malaria.""}","{""conditions"": [""Malaria"", ""Plasmodium falciparum Malaria"", ""Uncomplicated Malaria""], ""keywords"": [""Malaria"", ""Plasmodium falciparum"", ""Ruxolitinib"", ""Artemether"", ""Lumefantrine"", ""Artemether-lumefantrine"", ""JAK inhibitor"", ""Janus kinase inhibitor"", ""Host-directed therapy"", ""Type I interferon"", ""Immune response"", ""Pharmacokinetics"", ""Pharmacodynamics"", ""pSTAT3 inhibition"", ""Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3"", ""Phase 1 trial"", ""Drug combination"", ""Antimalarial therapy"", ""Healthy volunteers""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""targetDuration"": null, ""phases"": [""PHASE1""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""Randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center phase 1 trial.

Fremanezumab was administered either monthly or quarterly via subcutaneous injection. The primary objective was to assess long-term safety and tolerability by monitoring treatment-emergent adverse events, injection-site reactions, laboratory assessments, vital signs, and immunogenicity. Secondary objectives included evaluation of efficacy outcomes such as changes in monthly migraine days, headache days of at least moderate severity, and disability scores. The study enrolled 50 newly enrolled Japanese patients and included rollover patients from previous phase IIb/III trials for immunogenicity assessment (total n=587)."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This multicenter, randomized, open-label trial in Japanese patients with chronic migraine (CM) or episodic migraine (EM) consisted of a 4-week screening period, a 52-week treatment period, an end of treatment evaluation, and a 225-day follow-up period for anti-drug antibody (ADA) assessment. Key inclusion criteria included a history of migraine for at least 12 months prior to informed consent, with patients experiencing headache on 4-14 days for EM or at least 15 days for CM during the 28-day screening period.\n\nAfter screening, newly enrolled patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either monthly or quarterly subcutaneous administration of fremanezumab, stratified by CM or EM. The monthly regimen consisted of fremanezumab 675 mg (three 225 mg injections) for CM and 225 mg for EM at baseline, followed by 225 mg monthly for 12 months. The quarterly dosing regimen was fremanezumab 675 mg once every 3 months for both CM and EM groups.\n\nSafety outcomes included monitoring of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), injection-site reactions, laboratory tests, electrocardiograms, vital signs, and suicidal ideation and behavior using the Electronic Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale. TEAEs of special interest included injection-site reactions, hepatic events, ophthalmic events of at least moderate severity, anaphylaxis, severe hypersensitivity reactions, and cardiovascular-related events. Immunogenicity was assessed in a larger cohort (n=587) that included newly enrolled patients and rollover patients from previous phase IIb/III trials.\n\nEfficacy outcomes included changes from baseline in average monthly migraine days, headache days of at least moderate severity, headache days of any severity, days with use of any acute headache medications, days with nausea or vomiting, and days with photophobia and phonophobia. Responder rates (≥50% reduction in monthly migraine days or headache days of at least moderate severity) were assessed at months 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12. Disability was measured using the 6-Item Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) in CM patients and the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) in EM patients.\n\nThe study enrolled 50 newly enrolled patients (34 with CM, 16 with EM) from 11 institutions in Japan between December 2017 and June 2020. The discontinuation rate was low, with only 6 patients discontinuing treatment (2 for adverse events, 2 for withdrawal by subject, 1 for lack of efficacy, and 1 for protocol deviation).

Based on preclinical and clinical data suggesting potential synergy between PD-L1 inhibition and various immunomodulatory agents, three combination regimens were investigated. Arm A combined avelumab with utomilumab (an IgG2 4-1BB agonist) and rituximab, based on evidence that 4-1BB agonism and PD-L1 antagonism may be synergistic and that anti-4-1BB agonist mAbs can enhance rituximab's anti-lymphoma activity. Arm B combined avelumab with utomilumab and azacitidine, based on evidence that epigenetic priming by azacitidine might sensitize cancer cells to PD-1/PD-L1 axis blockade. Arm C combined avelumab with bendamustine and rituximab, given that bendamustine and rituximab is recommended for relapsed/refractory DLBCL. Key eligibility criteria included histologically confirmed DLBCL in patients at least 18 years of age with relapsed/refractory disease following two or more and up to four lines of rituximab-based multiagent chemotherapy. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to the three treatment arms. Avelumab 10 mg/kg was administered intravenously every 2 weeks in all arms. Primary endpoints were dose-limiting toxicities and objective response assessed by investigator per Lugano Response Classification criteria. Secondary endpoints included PD-L1 expression, minimal residual disease, duration of response, time to tumor response, disease control, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. The study also included comprehensive biomarker analyses including cell of origin assessment, immunohistochemical analyses for PD-L1, CD4, CD8, CD68, and 4-1BB/CD137, and minimal residual disease assessment using serial blood samples. The phase Ib component was designed to determine the most active treatment regimen to advance to a planned phase III component; however, due to insufficient antitumor activity in arms A and B and infeasibility of expanding arm C, the study was discontinued before initiation of the phase III component.""}","{""conditions"": [""Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma"", ""Relapsed Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma"", ""Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma"", ""Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma""], ""keywords"": [""Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma"", ""DLBCL"", ""Relapsed/Refractory DLBCL"", ""Avelumab"", ""PD-L1 Inhibitor"", ""Anti-PD-L1 Antibody"", ""Utomilumab"", ""4-1BB Agonist"", ""Rituximab"", ""Azacitidine"", ""Bendamustine"", ""Immunotherapy"", ""Checkpoint Inhibitor"", ""Combination Therapy"", ""B-Cell Lymphoma"", ""Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma"", ""Relapsed Lymphoma"", ""Refractory Lymphoma""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE1"", ""PHASE3""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": ""PARALLEL"", ""interventionModelDescription"": ""This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, seamless two-component (phase Ib planned to be followed by phase III), parallel-arm study.

However, HIV testing uptake is low in sub-Saharan Africa, where many people use informal health-care resources such as traditional healers. This study hypothesized that uptake of HIV tests would increase if provided by traditional healers. A cluster-randomised trial was conducted in rural southwestern Uganda to determine the effectiveness of traditional healers delivering HIV testing at point of care compared with referral to local clinics for HIV testing. Between August 2019 and February 2020, 17 traditional healers were randomly assigned as clusters (nine to intervention and eight to control), with 500 clients of unknown HIV serostatus enrolled (250 per group). In the intervention group, 250 clients (100%) received an HIV test compared with 57 (23%) in the control group, a 77% (95% CI 73-82) increase in testing uptake. Ten (4%) of 250 clients in the intervention group tested HIV positive, seven of whom self-reported linkage to HIV care. No new HIV cases were identified in the control group. Qualitative interviews revealed that HIV testing delivered by traditional healers was highly acceptable among both providers and clients. No safety or adverse events were reported."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This mixed-methods study included a cluster-randomised trial followed by individual qualitative interviews among a sample of participants in Mbarara, Uganda. Traditional healers aged 18 years or older who were located within 8 km of the Mbarara District HIV clinic, were identified in the 2018 population-level census of traditional healers in Mbarara District, and delivered care to at least seven clients per week were randomly assigned (1:1) as clusters to an intervention or a control group. Healers screened their clients for eligibility, and research assistants confirmed eligibility and enrolled clients who were aged 18 years or older, were receiving care from a participating healer, were sexually active (ever had intercourse), self-reported not having received an HIV test in the previous 12 months (and therefore considered to be of unknown serostatus), and had not previously been diagnosed with HIV infection.\n\nIntervention group healers provided counselling and offered point-of-care HIV tests (Oraquick oral swab HIV testing kits) to adult clients. Control group healers provided referral for HIV testing at nearby clinics. Healers from both study groups together attended a 1-day educational session on HIV transmission, HIV symptoms, HIV prevention, the role of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and Ugandan Ministry of Health HIV testing guidelines. Intervention group healers received additional training on pre-test and post-HIV test counselling, administration of Oraquick HIV testing kits, sample collection methodologies, and handwashing and hygiene measures. Control group healers received training to provide eligible clients with information about HIV transmission and the importance of voluntary HIV testing, and were provided with prepackaged envelopes containing a referral letter to give to eligible clients.\n\nThe primary outcome was the individual receipt of an HIV test within 90 days of study enrolment. Secondary outcomes were new HIV diagnoses and linkage to HIV care within 90 days of enrolment for clients who were newly diagnosed. Outcomes were assessed via healer records (intervention group) and self-report at 90-day follow-up phone call (control group). After trial completion, healers and a sample of clients were invited to participate in qualitative interviews to explore their experiences in the study and factors relevant to the study outcomes. The study demonstrated that delivery of point-of-care HIV tests by traditional healers to adults of unknown serostatus significantly increased rates of HIV testing in rural Uganda.

Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, 50 healthy adults performed a working memory (N-Back) task during functional MRI scanning while experiencing either safety or threat of shock (induced anxiety). The hypothesis was that pharmacologically enhancing cognitive function would influence how the brain's cognitive control networks (fronto-parietal control network) and emotion-related networks (default mode network) interact during anxiety."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This neuroimaging study examined the neural mechanisms by which performing a demanding cognitive task can reduce anxiety. While anxiety typically impairs cognition, prior research suggests that engaging in cognitively demanding tasks can be anxiolytic. The study tested three competing hypotheses about how methylphenidate (MPH), a cognitive enhancer, might affect neural networks during the interaction of anxiety and cognition: (A) increased dissociation between task-positive (fronto-parietal control network, FPCN) and task-negative (default mode network, DMN) networks, (B) redistribution of cognitive resources from FPCN to DMN, or (C) expansion of overall neural resources allowing both networks to function at higher levels.\n\nFifty healthy adults (26 females, mean age 28.2 years) were randomly assigned to receive either 20 mg oral methylphenidate or placebo in a double-blind, parallel-group design. Ninety minutes after drug administration, participants performed two runs of an N-Back working memory task (1-Back and 3-Back conditions) in a 3T MRI scanner. The task was performed under two contexts: safety (no shock) and threat (unpredictable electrical shocks). Functional MRI data were collected using multi-echo EPI sequences and analyzed to examine BOLD activation patterns in FPCN and DMN regions.\n\nResults supported the resource expansion hypothesis. In Run-1 (novel task context) during threat, MPH strengthened activation of FPCN regions (superior parietal lobule) and reduced DMN deactivation (precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, lateral orbitofrontal cortex) compared to placebo. This pattern suggests MPH allowed both cognitive processing and anxiety processing to occur simultaneously at optimal levels. MPH also improved overall working memory accuracy across conditions. The effects were most pronounced in the most demanding context: during threat, in the first run (novelty), and at high cognitive load (3-Back).

Eligible participants had 30-100 inflammatory lesions (pustules, papules, and nodules), 35-150 noninflammatory lesions (closed and open comedones), and two or fewer nodules. Participants were equally randomized to receive one of five treatments applied to the face once daily for 12 weeks: clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/BPO 3.1%/adapalene 0.15% gel (IDP-126); one of three component dyads (BPO/adapalene, clindamycin/BPO, or clindamycin/adapalene); or vehicle gel. All active dyads were formulated with the same active drug concentrations and within the same vehicle as IDP-126.\n\nCoprimary endpoints were treatment success at week 12 (≥2-grade reduction from baseline in EGSS and clear/almost clear skin) and least-squares mean absolute changes from baseline in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts to week 12. Secondary and post hoc analyses included treatment success and ≥2-grade EGSS reduction by study visit, percent changes in lesion counts, and quality-of-life assessments using the Acne-Specific Quality of Life (Acne-QoL) questionnaire. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events, investigator-assessed cutaneous safety (scaling, erythema, hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation), and participant-reported tolerability (itching, burning, stinging).\n\nIDP-126 is formulated as an aqueous gel with no alcohol, preservatives, occlusive agents, or surfactants. It is pH balanced for the skin and contains propylene glycol as a hydrating humectant. BPO and adapalene are micronized for better penetration of the pilosebaceous unit, and all ingredients are contained within a polymeric gel for even distribution on the skin. The combination targets three of the four acne pathogenic pathways: adapalene normalizes keratinocyte proliferation and has anti-inflammatory properties; BPO provides antibacterial activity with mild comedolytic effects; and clindamycin reduces C. acnes colonization with anti-inflammatory effects.

The three JTA-004 formulations contained: JTA-100/2 (100 μg clonidine, 20 mg HA in 2 ml), JTA-200/2 (200 μg clonidine, 20 mg HA in 2 ml), or JTA-200/4 (200 μg clonidine, 40 mg HA in 4 ml). All formulations contained plasma protein solution at 1.02 g/ml.\n\nThe study included an interim analysis at 3 months (116 patients) to select the most effective JTA-004 formulation, with an Independent Data Monitoring Committee reviewing unblinded safety and efficacy data. The primary endpoint in the second stage was to demonstrate superiority of the selected formulation over reference at 6 months using WOMAC Pain Subscale Score.\n\nEfficacy was assessed using WOMAC VA3.1 Osteoarthritis Scores (Pain, Stiffness, Physical Function subscales) and SF-12 Well-Being scores at injection day, 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Safety endpoints included adverse events, serious adverse events, laboratory results, and physical examination findings throughout the study duration. Drug consumption (analgesics/NSAIDs) was also monitored.\n\nStatistical analyses used ANCOVA adjusted for baseline values and Mixed-effect Model for Repeated Measurements. The study originally planned 41 patients per group (164 total) but was underpowered based on interim analysis showing larger variability than anticipated (observed SD 25-30 mm vs. expected 10.5 mm). The IDMC recommended increasing to 76 patients per group, but this was not implemented.\n\nResults showed that 147 of 164 treated patients completed the study. JTA-200/2 was selected at interim analysis. At 6 months, the difference in adjusted mean change in WOMAC Pain Subscale Score between JTA-200/2 and reference was -9.49 mm (95% CI: -22.21, 3.23; p=0.141), not meeting the superiority criterion.

A number of small-sample clinical studies have also discussed endovascular recanalization (ER) for sNA-ICAO; however, there is currently a lack of evidence from multicenter, prospective, large-sample cohort trials. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the technical feasibility and safety of endovascular recanalization for symptomatic non-acute intracranial artery occlusion. This is a multisite, non-randomized cohort, prospective registry study enrolling consecutive patients presenting with sNA-ICAO at 15 centers in China between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2022. A cohort of patients who received SMT and a cohort of similar patients who received ER plus SMT will be constructed and followed up for 2 years."", ""detailedDescription"": ""Large intracranial artery occlusion is a major cause of stroke and is associated with a high risk of stroke recurrence and poor stroke outcome, especially in China. For symptomatic non-acute intracranial artery occlusion (sNA-ICAO) (within 24 h to 6 months), some patients continue to be symptomatic despite standard medical therapy (SMT). Extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) artery bypass surgery fails to show benefits in preventing ischemic attacks or ischemic stroke when performed for sNA-ICAO. The optimal treatment for patients with sNA-ICAO disease remains undefined. Currently, SMT, including an antiplatelet regimen and risk factor management, has been used to treat patients with sNA-ICAO disease. Unfortunately, the natural course of this condition shows that these patients often experience recurrent symptoms despite SMT. Recently, a series of small-sample clinical studies have reported that endovascular recanalization (ER) is feasible for sNA-ICAO. However, most of the previous studies are based on small-sample, single-center retrospective analyses, and there is no high-level evidence from large multicenter samples or prospective studies to indicate the effectiveness and safety of ER for sNA-ICAO.\n\nThis study is a multicenter, prospective registry, non-randomized cohort study sponsored by professor Feng Gao of Beijing Tiantan hospital to assess patients affected by sNA-ICAO undergoing ER and SMT. Fifteen centers across China will participate in the study and provide data. Patients with imaging (MRA/CTA/DSA) and clinical diagnosis of sNA-ICAO will be included. Based on the patient's previous history, imaging features of the lesion and the attitudes of the patient and family members, the local investigative team in each center will determine whether to give SMT plus ER or SMT alone.\n\nStandard Medical Therapy (SMT): Patients in SMT group will take aspirin (100 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) for 90 days followed by lifelong aspirin or clopidogrel monotherapy thereafter. Risk factors including systolic blood pressure and LDL cholesterol will be controlled according to protocols. A lifestyle modification program, INTERVENT, will be provided to each patient.\n\nEndovascular Recanalization (ER) Protocol: A dual antiplatelet regimen with acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg) and clopidogrel (75 mg) is started at least 3 days before the procedure. All procedures are performed under general anesthesia by an experienced interventional neuroradiologist. The procedure involves passage of microcatheter through the occluded segment, balloon dilation, and stent deployment if necessary. Successful revascularization is defined as a modified TICI grade 2b or 3 and residual stenosis <50%. For patients with ICA or MCA M1 segment occlusion, ipsilateral hypoperfusion should be confirmed by CTP or MRI perfusion imaging prior to enrollment.\n\nThe primary outcome is any stroke from enrollment to 2 years of follow-up. The secondary outcomes are all-cause mortality, mRS score, NIHSS score and cognitive function from enrollment to 30 days, 3 months, 8 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 2 years of follow-up. For patients with ICA or MCA M1 segment occlusion, cognitive function assessment is performed at baseline and all follow-up time points. Subgroup analysis will be performed according to angiographic classification, stump morphology, duration from occlusion and clot characteristics. The study aims to recruit 160 patients in the ER plus SMT group and 320 patients in the SMT alone group (1:2 allocation).""}","{""conditions"": [""Intracranial Artery Occlusion"", ""Stroke"", ""Ischemic Stroke"", ""Cerebrovascular Disease""], ""keywords"": [""symptomatic non-acute intracranial artery occlusion"", ""sNA-ICAO"", ""endovascular recanalization"", ""standard medical therapy"", ""stroke"", ""ischemic events"", ""intracranial artery occlusion"", ""cerebrovascular disease"", ""antiplatelet therapy"", ""stenting"", ""balloon angioplasty""]}","{""parameter"": {""designModule"": {""studyType"": ""OBSERVATIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": true, ""targetDuration"": ""2 years"", ""phases"": [""NA""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""NON_RANDOMIZED"", ""interventionModel"": null, ""interventionModelDescription"": null, ""primaryPurpose"": null, ""observationalModel"": ""COHORT"", ""timePerspective"": ""PROSPECTIVE"", ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""SINGLE"", ""maskingDescription"": ""Outcome will be determined by an adjudication committee that is unaware of the trial design and grouping."", ""whoMasked"": [""OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR""]}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 480, ""type"": ""ESTIMATED""}}}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Endovascular Recanalization plus Standard Medical Therapy (ER plus SMT)"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Patients receive endovascular recanalization procedure plus standard medical therapy including dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 100 mg/day and clopidogrel 75 mg/day) for 90 days (or 3-6 months post-procedure) followed by lifelong aspirin or clopidogrel monotherapy, blood pressure control (systolic BP <140 mmHg or <130 mmHg in diabetics), LDL cholesterol control (<70 mg/dl with Atorvastatin), and lifestyle modification programs."", ""interventionNames"": [""PROCEDURE: Endovascular Recanalization"", ""DRUG: Aspirin"", ""DRUG: Clopidogrel"", ""DRUG: Atorvastatin"", ""DRUG: Heparin"", ""BEHAVIORAL: Lifestyle Modification Program (INTERVENT)"", ""OTHER: Blood Pressure Control"", ""OTHER: LDL Cholesterol Control""]}, {""label"": ""Standard Medical Therapy Alone (SMT)"", ""type"": ""ACTIVE_COMPARATOR"", ""description"": ""Patients receive standard medical therapy including dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 100 mg/day and clopidogrel 75 mg/day) for 90 days followed by lifelong aspirin or clopidogrel monotherapy, blood pressure control (systolic BP <140 mmHg or <130 mmHg in diabetics), LDL cholesterol control (<70 mg/dl with Atorvastatin), and lifestyle modification programs."", ""interventionNames"": [""DRUG: Aspirin"", ""DRUG: Clopidogrel"", ""DRUG: Atorvastatin"", ""BEHAVIORAL: Lifestyle Modification Program (INTERVENT)"", ""OTHER: Blood Pressure Control"", ""OTHER: LDL Cholesterol Control""]}], ""interventions"": [{""type"": ""PROCEDURE"", ""name"": ""Endovascular Recanalization"", ""description"": ""Endovascular procedure performed under general anesthesia by experienced interventional neuroradiologist.

Both groups received links to a library of psychoeducational videos and completed web-based assessments monthly for 3 months. The study hypothesized that youth would engage with MoST-MH at high rates and report high usability, and that MoST-MH would lead to greater mental health self-efficacy, lower symptom severity, and higher rates of follow-through with mental health care compared to eUC."", ""detailedDescription"": ""Mental health disorders are common among young adults, with 20% of college students internationally and 31% of US college students meeting criteria for a mental health diagnosis. The transition from high school to college is a critical period where mental health support is lacking yet urgently needed, as new stresses related to academics, finances, and relationships can worsen mental health symptoms. Digital technology could assist young adults by providing rapid and efficient access to mental health support. To address existing barriers, the Mobile Support Tool for Mental Health (MoST-MH) was developed as an automated, transdiagnostic intervention designed to minimize burden using a stepwise algorithm that adapts frequency of interaction to the needs of the youth. MoST-MH is an ecological momentary intervention that provides support in the context of a young adult's current state and needs through periodic text message mental health check-ins, triggering web-based check-ins (when mental health was rated low) to understand stressors, negative effects, and self-efficacy, which informed self-efficacy support strategies drawn from positive psychology, cognitive behavioral therapy, and dialectical behavioral therapy, and prompted links to psychoeducational videos. This pilot randomized trial recruited youths aged 18 years and older with a current mental health diagnosis from one primary care (n=31) and one mental health clinic (n=21) in Pittsburgh, PA, from August to October 2020. Participants were randomized 2:1 to either receive MoST-MH (n=34) or enhanced Usual Care (eUC; n=18).

The study tests the hypothesis that blockade of CD28/B7 costimulatory signaling with abatacept would suppress the psoriasis molecular signature and prevent psoriasis relapse after ustekinumab withdrawal."", ""detailedDescription"": ""Psoriasis vulgaris is a systemic immune-mediated disease that predominantly involves the skin and joints. The pathogenesis involves activated interleukin (IL)-17-producing T cells in skin, perpetuated by an IL-23-mediated psoriasis molecular signature that reflects the pathogenic keratinocyte response. Ustekinumab is a US Food and Drug Administration-approved biologic agent for psoriasis that targets the IL-12/IL-23 pathways. Ongoing administration of ustekinumab is required because discontinuation leads to psoriasis relapse.\n\nT-cell activation depends on both antigen-specific engagement of the T-cell receptor and costimulation by antigen-presenting cells. The CD28 protein induces a critical costimulatory signal in T cells on ligation of CD80/CD86. Antigen engagement of the T-cell receptor in the absence of CD28-mediated costimulation may lead to T-cell tolerance, providing a rationale for costimulatory blockade as a therapeutic strategy in autoimmunity.\n\nAbatacept (CTLA4-Ig) is a costimulatory-blocking fusion protein that consists of the extracellular domain of the CTLA4 ligand for CD80/CD86 coupled to a modified Fc portion of human IgG. Abatacept acts by competing for CD80/CD86 binding to CD28 on T cells, thereby inhibiting T-cell activation and function. It is hypothesized that costimulatory blockade with abatacept could induce tolerance in pathogenic T cells encountering antigen in resolving psoriasis lesions, leading to long-term remission.\n\nThe PAUSE trial was conducted to determine whether blockade of costimulatory signaling with abatacept could prevent psoriasis relapse after ustekinumab withdrawal. The trial consisted of a lead-in phase (weeks 0 to 12), a randomized treatment phase (weeks 12 to 40), and an observation phase (weeks 40 to 88). During the lead-in phase, participants with moderate to severe psoriasis received subcutaneous ustekinumab. At week 12, participants who achieved 75% or greater improvement from baseline were randomized 1:1 to either continued ustekinumab or switched to abatacept. Treatment was discontinued at week 39, and participants were followed up for psoriasis relapse until week 88.

Current treatments with nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) and pegylated interferons achieve low functional cure rates, defined as sustained loss of detectable serum HBsAg with undetectable HBV DNA. Bepirovirsen is an antisense oligonucleotide with a 2'-O-methoxyethyl gapmer design that targets all HBV messenger RNAs and pregenomic RNA, leading to reductions in HBV-derived RNAs, HBV DNA, and viral proteins including HBsAg in preclinical models.\n\nThis phase 2, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 31 patients with CHB from seven centers in Hong Kong and the Republic of Korea. Twenty-four patients were treatment-naïve and seven were receiving stable NA therapy. Patients were randomized 3:1 within each dose cohort to receive bepirovirsen (150 mg or 300 mg) or placebo. Treatment consisted of six subcutaneous injections administered twice weekly during weeks 1 and 2 (days 1, 4, 8, and 11) and once weekly during weeks 3 and 4 (days 15 and 22), followed by a 26-week follow-up period. After day 29 assessments, treatment-naïve patients initiated NA therapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or entecavir.\n\nThe study assessed safety endpoints including adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and concomitant medication usage. Efficacy endpoints included changes in plasma HBV DNA and serum HBsAg concentrations from baseline to day 29 and week 31, proportion of participants with HBsAg loss, and changes in serum HBeAg concentration in HBeAg-positive patients. Exploratory endpoints included seroconversion rates to anti-HBs or anti-HBe antibodies. Additional virological biomarkers including HBV RNA, hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg), and sequencing of the bepirovirsen binding site were assessed post hoc.\n\nResults demonstrated dose-dependent reductions in HBsAg and HBV DNA in treatment-naïve patients, with statistically significant reductions observed in the bepirovirsen 300 mg group compared to placebo. Four patients achieved HBsAg levels below the lower limit of quantitation. Treatment-emergent adverse events were mostly mild to moderate, with injection site reactions being most common. Transient, self-resolving alanine aminotransferase (ALT) flares were observed in eleven patients receiving bepirovirsen, temporally associated with HBsAg reductions.

Instead of delivering high dose hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HFSRT) as 5 consecutive daily fractions, the study proposes intermittent radiotherapy (iRT) delivered as single fractions every 6 weeks, with an optional 3-fraction boost at progression. Using data from 16 patients enrolled in the NCT02313272 phase 1 trial (which combined HFSRT with bevacizumab and pembrolizumab), the researchers developed a mathematical model to simulate tumor growth and treatment response. The model suggests that iRT with optional boost could be equal or superior to HFSRT in 15 out of 16 cases, particularly for patients who remain responsive to pembrolizumab and bevacizumab. The intermittent approach allows for treatment personalization based on observed responses and could potentially prolong time to progression through additional intermittently delivered fractions."", ""detailedDescription"": ""Recurrent high-grade glioma patients face poor prognosis with no curative treatment options and median overall survival less than 1 year. Current NCCN guidelines do not define a standard of care, with treatment options including re-resection, systemic therapy (bevacizumab, lomustine, temozolomide), palliative re-irradiation, and investigational immunotherapy approaches. The NCT02313272 phase 1 trial demonstrated safety of combining HFSRT (≥6 Gy × 5 daily fractions) with bevacizumab and pembrolizumab, though median time to progression remained below 1 year.\n\nThis modeling study proposes that tumor management through intermittent RT may prolong time to progression compared to attempted tumor eradication via HFSRT. The approach is motivated by evolutionary principles: intermittent treatment maintains a treatment-sensitive population that competes with resistant cells, potentially slowing resistant clone expansion. Additionally, intermittent delivery may widen the therapeutic window due to superior normal tissue repair capacity, allow for repeated immune system stimuli when combined with checkpoint inhibitors, and enable dose/volume adaptation based on observed responses.\n\nThe mathematical model uses three patient-specific parameters: initial tumor volume (V₀), rate of resistance development to bevacizumab/pembrolizumab (ε), and radiation surviving fraction (S). A population-uniform tumor growth rate (λ = 0.065 day⁻¹, corresponding to 11-day doubling time) was identified through grid search optimization. The model describes viable and dying tumor compartments, with exponential growth in absence of treatment, exponential volume reduction upon drug treatment, and radiation-induced cell transfer to the dying compartment. Treatment resistance builds up exponentially over time.\n\nSimulations compared three protocols: (1) HFSRT as delivered in NCT02313272, (2) iRT delivering fractions every 6 weeks, and (3) iRT plus 3-fraction boost at progression (defined as >20% volume increase above minimum). Model parameters fitted from HFSRT data were used to simulate iRT scenarios. Efficacy was evaluated by time to reach last recorded tumor volume (assumed maximum tolerated burden) using Kaplan-Meier analysis.\n\nKey findings include: (1) iRT+boost was non-inferior to HFSRT in 15/16 patients; (2) patients with slow resistance development (small ε) benefited most from iRT; (3) extending treatment to more fractions (up to 13) progressively prolonged time to progression in responsive patients, reaching statistical significance (p=0.045) at 13 fractions; (4) significant negative correlation between radioresistance (S) and resistance development rate (ε) was observed.\n\nPatients were stratified into four response groups: Group 1 (HFSRT best, n=1), Group 2 (iRT inferior but compensated by boost, n=4), Group 3 (iRT+boost extends progression beyond iRT alone, n=5), and Group 4 (iRT best, n=6). Groups differed significantly in resistance development rates but not in radiosensitivity.\n\nThe model provides a worst-case estimate by not explicitly modeling: radiation-induced immune stimulation, preferential repopulation by sensitive clones between fractions, potential growth plateauing in larger tumors, or pharmacodynamics of drug administration. Despite these conservative assumptions, iRT demonstrated potential benefit. The approach enables personalized treatment decisions based on early response assessment, geometric dose delivery adaptation, and fraction size optimization. The 6-week interval balanced imaging cost with growth observation and provided time for response-adapted decision-making.\n\nLimitations include: small cohort size (n=16) limiting statistical power, sparse on-treatment data points (median 6 per patient), inability to separate RT and immunotherapy effects, lack of genetic/molecular biomarkers, and theoretical nature requiring prospective clinical validation. Normal tissue toxicity modeling was not included but acute effects (headache, seizures, edema) and radiation necrosis remain important considerations requiring monitoring and potential treatment cessation in the personalized iRT approach.\n\nThe study concludes that iRT represents a promising, mathematically feasible treatment strategy for rHGG patients that warrants prospective clinical evaluation, particularly for patients with asymptomatic recurrence or neurological stability.""}","{""conditions"": [""Recurrent High Grade Glioma"", ""Glioblastoma"", ""High-Grade Glioma"", ""Malignant Glioma"", ""Brain Neoplasms""], ""keywords"": [""Intermittent Radiotherapy"", ""Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy"", ""Mathematical Modeling"", ""Tumor Growth Dynamics"", ""Bevacizumab"", ""Pembrolizumab"", ""Immunotherapy"", ""Checkpoint Inhibitors"", ""Treatment Resistance"", ""Adaptive Radiotherapy"", ""Personalized Medicine"", ""Radiation Fractionation"", ""Evolutionary Oncology"", ""Tumor Control"", ""Time to Progression"", ""Re-irradiation"", ""Brain Metastases"", ""Palliative Radiotherapy"", ""Immune Stimulation"", ""Radiosensitivity""]}","{""studyType"": ""INTERVENTIONAL"", ""patientRegistry"": false, ""phases"": [""PHASE1""], ""designInfo"": {""allocation"": ""NA"", ""interventionModel"": ""SINGLE_GROUP"", ""primaryPurpose"": ""TREATMENT"", ""maskingInfo"": {""masking"": ""NONE""}}, ""enrollmentInfo"": {""count"": 16, ""type"": ""ACTUAL""}}","{""armGroups"": [{""label"": ""Recurrent High-Grade Glioma Patients"", ""type"": ""EXPERIMENTAL"", ""description"": ""Patients with recurrent high-grade glioma (rHGG) treated with hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HFSRT) at 6 Gy × 5 fractions delivered consecutively over 1 week, combined with bevacizumab and pembrolizumab."", ""interventionNames"": [""RADIATION: Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy (HFSRT)"", ""DRUG: Bevacizumab"", ""DRUG: Pembrolizumab""]}], ""interventions"": [{""type"": ""RADIATION"", ""name"": ""Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy (HFSRT)"", ""description"": ""30-35 Gy to planning target volume (PTV) with simultaneously integrated boost to gross tumor volume (GTV) of D95% = 30-40 Gy, delivered as 6 Gy × 5 fractions in consecutive daily treatments.

Increasing physical activity can reduce pain severity and decrease opioid use in patients with chronic pain. Behavioral economic strategies combining lottery incentives with loss aversion have been effective in promoting physical activity in non-veteran populations without chronic pain. This study evaluated whether a \""regret lottery\"" - where veterans could win money if they met activity goals or were told what they would have won had they met their goals - would increase physical activity levels among veterans with chronic pain. The hypothesis was that this behavioral economic approach would motivate increased physical activity through immediate gratification and avoidance of regret."", ""detailedDescription"": ""This was a 12-week single-blinded randomized controlled trial conducted at the Corporal Michael J. Crescenz VA Medical Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Forty veterans with chronic non-malignant pain receiving care from a pain-focused primary aligned care team (Pain PACT) were enrolled between July 2019 and January 2020. Participants were randomized 1:1 to either a control arm (activity trackers and daily text message reminders to increase physical activity) or an intervention arm (same as control plus a weekly regret lottery). The regret lottery provided participants who met weekly activity goals (either a 5% increase in steps over the previous week, or achieving and maintaining 150% of baseline steps) with a chance to win a small ($30; 18% chance) or large ($100; 1% chance) gift card incentive. Those who did not meet their goals were informed of what they would have won had they met their goal. The primary outcome was physical activity measured using Fitbit step counts and the Stanford 7-Day Physical Activity Recall Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes included pain-related physical function (Pain Outcomes Questionnaire), chronic pain severity, depression symptoms (PHQ-9), and opioid analgesic use extracted from electronic health records. All participants received $75 for complete study participation. Data were collected at baseline and at 12 weeks, with activity tracking occurring throughout the study period.
