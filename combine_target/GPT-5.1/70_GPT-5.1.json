      "briefSummary": "This phase IIIb randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial (SKIPPAIN; NCT03136861) evaluated whether secukinumab 150 mg is more effective than placebo in rapidly reducing spinal pain and disease activity in adults with active axial spondyloarthritis (both radiographic and non-radiographic forms) who had an inadequate response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Patients were treated for 8 weeks with secukinumab 150 mg or placebo; from Week 8 to Week 24 all patients received secukinumab 150 or 300 mg, with non-responders eligible for dose escalation. The primary outcome was achieving an average spinal pain score below 4 (0–10 scale) at Week 8. Secukinumab showed significantly higher pain response and improvements in disease activity scores versus placebo, with sustained or further benefits up to Week 24 and no new safety signals.",
      "detailedDescription": "SKIPPAIN (NCT03136861) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase IIIb, multicenter trial designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of secukinumab in adults with active axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), including both radiographic axSpA (ankylosing spondylitis) and non-radiographic axSpA. The trial specifically focused on spinal pain as the primary endpoint, reflecting a key treatment priority from the patient perspective.\n\nEligible patients were ≥18 years old, fulfilled Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) criteria for axSpA, and had active disease defined by a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) ≥4 and an average spinal pain score >4 on a 0–10 numerical rating scale (NRS). All had an inadequate response or intolerance to at least two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Prior exposure to a single TNF-α inhibitor was allowed following an appropriate washout. Key exclusions included prior treatment with other biologic immunomodulators (beyond one TNF inhibitor), other active inflammatory diseases, significant mechanical spinal disease, serious infections, malignancy within 5 years, and major uncontrolled comorbidities.\n\nThe study comprised two treatment periods. In Treatment Period 1 (TP1, baseline to Week 8), 380 patients were randomized 3:1 to receive secukinumab 150 mg or placebo, administered subcutaneously at baseline and Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 with blinding maintained via identical-appearing injections. The primary objective was to demonstrate superiority of secukinumab 150 mg over placebo in achieving an average spinal pain NRS score <4 at Week 8. Average spinal pain was calculated as the mean of total spinal pain (pain at any time) and nocturnal spinal pain (pain during the night), each self-reported on an 11-point NRS. The key secondary objective was superiority of secukinumab versus placebo in achieving BASDAI <4 at Week 8.\n\nAt Week 8, patients entered Treatment Period 2 (TP2, Week 8 to Week 24), during which all received active secukinumab 150 or 300 mg every 4 weeks (Weeks 8–20). Patients initially on secukinumab 150 mg who achieved average spinal pain <4 were classified as responders and reassigned to continue secukinumab 150 mg (Arm A1). Non-responders from the original secukinumab group were re-randomized to either continue 150 mg (Arm A2) or escalate to 300 mg (Arm A3) without loading. Patients originally on placebo were re-randomized 1:1 to secukinumab 150 mg (Arm B1) or 300 mg (Arm B2). This design allowed evaluation of both early pain response and a step-up dose optimization strategy in suboptimal responders.\n\nExploratory objectives included: (1) proportions of patients achieving spinal pain NRS <4 at Weeks 1–4 and Week 24; (2) BASDAI <4 at Week 24; (3) Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) <2.1 (low disease activity) and <1.3 (inactive disease) at Week 8 and Week 24; (4) changes in fatigue using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy–Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue); and (5) changes in overall health and functioning using the ASAS Health Index (ASAS-HI). Safety and tolerability of secukinumab 150 and 300 mg were characterized by adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and AEs of special interest (e.g., infections, inflammatory bowel disease, major adverse cardiovascular events) over both treatment periods and 12 weeks of follow-up.\n\nThe primary analysis used a logistic regression model including treatment, country, and prior TNF inhibitor exposure, applied to the full analysis set for TP1. At Week 8, 31.9% of secukinumab-treated versus 20.0% of placebo-treated patients achieved average spinal pain NRS <4, corresponding to an odds ratio of 1.89 (95% CI 1.08–3.33; p=0.0264). Secukinumab also improved nocturnal spinal pain, with a statistically significant odds ratio versus placebo, and showed numerically higher response for total spinal pain. The proportion of pain responders was higher with secukinumab as early as Week 1 and remained greater through Week 8.\n\nFor disease activity, 33.3% of secukinumab versus 23.2% of placebo patients achieved BASDAI <4 at Week 8 (OR 1.75; 95% CI 1.01–3.04; p=0.0466). Mean BASDAI and ASDAS scores decreased more with secukinumab than with placebo by Week 8. In TP2, all arms receiving secukinumab demonstrated further improvements in spinal pain and disease activity up to Week 24, with the greatest numerical gains in patients who were responders at Week 8 and continued on 150 mg (Arm A1). This arm also showed the highest proportions achieving ASDAS <2.1 and <1.3, and the largest improvements in FACIT-Fatigue and ASAS-HI, indicating better fatigue and overall health status.\n\nAmong Week 8 non-responders originally on 150 mg secukinumab, dose escalation to 300 mg (Arm A3) led to modestly higher numerical improvements in pain and disease activity compared with continuing 150 mg (Arm A2), particularly for high-hurdle endpoints such as ASDAS <2.1 and <1.3. However, these comparisons were exploratory, the study was not powered for direct dose comparisons, loading doses were not re-applied at up-titration, and Week 8 may have been too early to capture the full effect of 150 mg in some patients.\n\nSecukinumab exhibited a safety profile consistent with previous axSpA trials. Overall exposure in TP1 was about 4 weeks and in TP2 approximately 12 weeks. Across the entire 24-week treatment period, 2.4% of patients experienced serious AEs, 2.4% discontinued due to AEs, and no deaths occurred. Common AEs included headache, nasopharyngitis, oropharyngeal pain, and upper respiratory tract infection. Events of special interest, such as ulcerative colitis, major adverse cardiovascular events, neutropenia, and uveitis, were infrequent.\n\nOverall, the study demonstrates that secukinumab 150 mg provides rapid and clinically meaningful reductions in spinal pain and improvements in disease activity in patients with axial spondyloarthritis inadequately controlled by NSAIDs, with benefits sustained or enhanced through 24 weeks. The data suggest that a step-up strategy to 300 mg may be useful for suboptimal responders, though this requires confirmation in studies specifically powered for dose comparisons. The trial also underscores the importance and feasibility of using patient-reported spinal pain as a primary endpoint in axSpA clinical research."
