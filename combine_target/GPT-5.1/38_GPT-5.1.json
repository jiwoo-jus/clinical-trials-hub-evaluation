      "briefSummary": "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial (IPATunity130 Cohort B) evaluated whether adding the oral AKT inhibitor ipatasertib to standard paclitaxel chemotherapy improves outcomes in patients with hormone receptor‑positive, HER2‑negative unresectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose tumors harbor PIK3CA, AKT1, and/or PTEN alterations. Eligible patients had measurable disease, were considered inappropriate for further endocrine‑based therapy (due to endocrine resistance or visceral crisis), and were candidates for taxane monotherapy, without prior chemotherapy for advanced disease. Patients were randomized 2:1 to ipatasertib plus paclitaxel or placebo plus paclitaxel and treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression‑free survival. The study found that adding ipatasertib did not improve progression‑free survival or response rate compared with paclitaxel alone, while increasing some toxicities such as diarrhea, and the combination’s safety profile was consistent with known effects of each agent.",
      "detailedDescription": "IPATunity130 Cohort B is a component of a multicohort, phase 3 clinical trial investigating AKT inhibition in breast cancer. Cohort B specifically enrolled patients with hormone receptor‑positive (HR+, defined as ≥1% staining), HER2‑negative unresectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose tumors had activating alterations in PIK3CA and/or AKT1 and/or inactivating alterations in PTEN, as determined by a Foundation Medicine next‑generation sequencing Clinical Trial Assay. Patients had to be considered inappropriate for endocrine‑based therapy because of endocrine therapy insensitivity (primary or secondary endocrine resistance) or visceral crisis, and they had to be candidates for taxane monotherapy with an ECOG performance status of 0–1. Prior chemotherapy for advanced disease and relapse within 1 year of completion of (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy were exclusionary, as were known or suspected brain or spinal cord metastases. Prior treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors was allowed.\n\nPatients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either ipatasertib or placebo in combination with paclitaxel. Ipatasertib was administered orally at 400 mg once daily on days 1–21 of each 28‑day cycle; paclitaxel was given intravenously at 80 mg/m² on days 1, 8 and 15 of each cycle. Randomization was stratified by prior (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy, prior PI3K/mTOR inhibitor use, and geographic region. To address the known risk of diarrhea associated with ipatasertib and paclitaxel, loperamide prophylaxis was mandated during the first cycle where permitted. Treatment continued until disease progression per RECIST v1.1, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal; patients could continue single‑agent ipatasertib/placebo or paclitaxel if the other drug was discontinued. Crossover from placebo to ipatasertib was not allowed.\n\nThe primary endpoint was investigator‑assessed progression‑free survival (PFS), defined as the time from randomization to disease progression by RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause. A sensitivity analysis of PFS was performed using assessment by an independent review committee. Key secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), confirmed objective response rate (ORR), duration of response, clinical benefit rate (complete or partial response or stable disease ≥24 weeks), patient‑reported outcomes using the EORTC QLQ‑C30, and safety and tolerability, including the incidence and severity of adverse events graded by CTCAE v4.0.\n\nA total of 222 patients were randomized: 146 to ipatasertib plus paclitaxel and 76 to placebo plus paclitaxel. Baseline characteristics, including prior systemic therapies (such as CDK4/6 and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors), distribution of metastatic sites, and endocrine resistance patterns, were generally balanced. Most patients had visceral disease, and a substantial proportion had either primary or secondary endocrine resistance by ESMO criteria; another subset had visceral crisis without meeting formal endocrine resistance definitions.\n\nAt a median follow‑up of 12.9 months, the trial did not demonstrate an efficacy benefit for the addition of ipatasertib. Median investigator‑assessed PFS was 9.3 months in both arms (hazard ratio 1.00, 95% CI 0.71–1.40), and independent review committee‑assessed PFS was consistent with these results. Objective response rates among patients with measurable disease were 47% in each arm, with similar median durations of response and clinical benefit rates. OS data were immature at the time of reporting; median OS was not reached in the ipatasertib arm and was 20.9 months in the placebo arm, with a hazard ratio of 0.72 (95% CI 0.42–1.24) that did not meet criteria for statistical significance.\n\nPatient‑reported global health status/quality of life scores were maintained during treatment in both arms, with no clinically meaningful decline observed up to approximately 10 treatment cycles. Time to confirmed clinically meaningful deterioration in pain, measured by the EORTC QLQ‑C30 pain scale, did not differ significantly, though Kaplan–Meier curves suggested a modest, non‑significant advantage for the control arm.\n\nThe safety profile reflected the known toxicities of ipatasertib and paclitaxel. Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred more frequently with ipatasertib plus paclitaxel (55%) than with placebo plus paclitaxel (47%). Diarrhea, a recognized class effect of AKT inhibition, was substantially more common with ipatasertib (all‑grade 85%, grade 3 in 12%) compared with placebo (37% all‑grade, 1% grade 3). Other frequent toxicities included alopecia, nausea, vomiting, anemia, peripheral neuropathy, neutropenia, hepatic enzyme elevations, and hyperglycemia, with generally higher gastrointestinal and neuropathic toxicity in the ipatasertib arm. Serious adverse events were also more common with ipatasertib, and there were two treatment‑related deaths across the study (one febrile neutropenia in the ipatasertib arm and one sepsis in the paclitaxel‑alone arm). Paclitaxel exposure (duration and cumulative dose) was lower in the ipatasertib arm, partly due to toxicity‑related discontinuations, which may have impacted the ability to isolate any contribution of ipatasertib to efficacy.\n\nOverall, IPATunity130 Cohort B showed that adding the AKT inhibitor ipatasertib to paclitaxel did not improve progression‑free survival, objective response, or early overall survival in patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN‑altered HR+ HER2‑negative advanced breast cancer who were not suitable for further endocrine therapy. The regimen was tolerable with proactive management of diarrhea but associated with higher rates of gastrointestinal and neuropathic adverse events. In the broader context of PI3K/AKT pathway targeting in HR+ HER2‑negative breast cancer, the findings contrast with trials where PI3K or AKT inhibitors are combined with endocrine therapy, such as SOLAR‑1 and FAKTION, which demonstrated PFS benefits. The authors suggest that effective endocrine receptor blockade may be necessary to realize the therapeutic potential of AKT inhibition in this disease setting, and ongoing studies are focusing on combinations of ipatasertib with endocrine and/or immunotherapies."
