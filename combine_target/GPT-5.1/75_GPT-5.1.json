      "briefSummary": "This phase 1, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial in healthy adults evaluated whether the Janus kinase (JAK1/2) inhibitor ruxolitinib can be safely given together with the standard antimalarial combination artemether-lumefantrine. Eight healthy volunteers received artemether-lumefantrine plus either ruxolitinib or placebo for 3 days. The study assessed safety, tolerability, blood levels (pharmacokinetics) of all drugs, and the biological activity of ruxolitinib by measuring inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation (pSTAT3) in blood cells. The combination was well tolerated, with only mild adverse events and no serious safety signals. Coadministration did not meaningfully change exposure to artemether, its metabolite dihydroartemisinin, or lumefantrine, and ruxolitinib produced about threefold greater pSTAT3 inhibition than placebo with a direct relationship between ruxolitinib blood levels and pSTAT3 inhibition. These results support further studies of ruxolitinib added to artemether-lumefantrine in controlled Plasmodium falciparum infection models.",
      "detailedDescription": "This was a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center phase 1 trial conducted in healthy male and female volunteers aged 18 to 55 years in Brisbane, Australia. The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of combining the approved artemisinin-based antimalarial regimen artemether-lumefantrine with the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of artemether, its major active metabolite dihydroartemisinin, lumefantrine, and ruxolitinib when coadministered, and to characterize the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of ruxolitinib through inhibition of IL‑6–induced phosphorylation of STAT3 (pSTAT3) in white blood cells.\n\nThe immunologic rationale is based on evidence that type I interferons and downstream JAK–STAT signaling contribute to parasite-induced immune dysregulation in Plasmodium falciparum infection, including expansion of regulatory Tr1 cells and impaired antiparasitic CD4+ T‑cell responses. Ruxolitinib, an oral JAK1/2 inhibitor approved for myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease, can block type I IFN signaling and reduce pSTAT3, thereby potentially restoring more effective antiparasitic immunity when given with standard antimalarial therapy.\n\nEight healthy participants were enrolled and randomized: six to artemether-lumefantrine plus ruxolitinib 20 mg twice daily and two to artemether-lumefantrine plus placebo twice daily for 3 days. Artemether-lumefantrine was administered at the standard adult dose for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria (four 20/120 mg tablets per dose, six doses over 3 days, total 480/2880 mg), each dose taken with full-fat milk. Ruxolitinib or matching placebo was administered orally 2 hours after each artemether-lumefantrine dose (total ruxolitinib dose 120 mg). The 2‑hour separation was chosen to minimize any potential inhibition of intestinal CYP3A4 by ruxolitinib, as artemether and lumefantrine are CYP3A4 substrates.\n\nParticipants were intensively monitored during in-clinic confinement (day −1 through day 4) and at outpatient follow‑up visits through day 29. Safety assessments included adverse event recording (MedDRA terms, CTCAE v5.0 grading), vital signs, 12‑lead ECGs with QTcF evaluation, clinical laboratory testing (hematology, chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis), physical examinations, and concomitant medication review.\n\nFor PK assessment, serial blood samples were collected over 72 hours after the first artemether-lumefantrine dose and at later time points up to 672 hours. Plasma concentrations of artemether, dihydroartemisinin, lumefantrine, and ruxolitinib were quantified by validated LC–MS/MS assays. Noncompartmental PK analysis generated parameters such as Cmax, Tmax, AUC over various intervals, and apparent half-life where feasible.\n\nEx vivo PD assessment of JAK–STAT pathway inhibition used IL‑6 stimulation of whole blood followed by measurement of pSTAT3 and total STAT3 in white blood cells. Percent pSTAT3 inhibition was calculated relative to baseline (average of three pre‑dose time points). Area under the effect–time curve over the dosing interval (AUECT) was used to summarize PD effects. The relationship between ruxolitinib plasma concentration and %pSTAT3 inhibition was characterized using a direct effect sigmoid Emax model within a PK/PD modeling framework. One‑compartment PK with first-order absorption and elimination, and a sigmoidal Emax effect model without delay, best described the data, indicating minimal hysteresis between concentration and effect.\n\nSix of eight participants experienced treatment-emergent adverse events, all mild. One participant in the ruxolitinib group had a headache considered related to study drugs; in the placebo group, headache and a maculopapular rash (onset 12 days after first dosing, resolving within 3 days with topical corticosteroids) were considered drug-related. There were no serious adverse events, no discontinuations due to adverse events, and no deaths. No clinically relevant trends were noted in vital signs, laboratory parameters, or ECGs; two ruxolitinib recipients had QTcF prolongations >30 ms, but no QTcF exceeded 450 ms.\n\nIn the small placebo group, artemether was rapidly absorbed (median Tmax ~2.4 h) with declining concentrations thereafter; dihydroartemisinin showed a similar pattern. Lumefantrine exposure (AUC) and elimination half-life (~200 h) were consistent with known profiles. In the ruxolitinib group, overall exposure to artemether, dihydroartemisinin and lumefantrine was broadly similar to placebo. Artemether Cmax decreased by day 3 compared to day 1 in both groups, but on day 3 it was statistically lower in the ruxolitinib group than in the placebo group in a post hoc analysis. Ruxolitinib itself was rapidly absorbed (median Tmax ~1.5 h), with an estimated half-life of about 2.5 h from PK/PD modeling. Apparent lower ruxolitinib exposure on day 3 vs day 1 was observed, though comparisons are limited by different sampling schedules.\n\nRuxolitinib coadministration produced marked inhibition of pSTAT3 compared with placebo. The geometric mean AUECT for %pSTAT3 inhibition was 544 ng·h/ml in the ruxolitinib group and 181 ng·h/ml in the placebo group, yielding a geometric mean ratio of 3.01 (90% CI 2.14–4.24), i.e., approximately threefold greater inhibition with ruxolitinib plus artemether-lumefantrine. PK/PD modeling confirmed a direct and predictable relationship between ruxolitinib plasma concentrations and %pSTAT3 inhibition without appreciable temporal delay.\n\nThe authors conclude that ruxolitinib administered 2 hours after artemether-lumefantrine is well tolerated in healthy volunteers and does not appear to substantially alter the PK of artemether, dihydroartemisinin, or lumefantrine in this small exploratory study. The observed robust pSTAT3 inhibition supports further evaluation of ruxolitinib as a host-directed adjunct to artemether-lumefantrine in controlled human Plasmodium falciparum infection studies, with the long-term goal of enhancing protective antiparasitic immunity and potentially reducing malaria reinfection or severe disease. Limitations include the small sample size, exploratory nature of PK comparisons, lack of a ruxolitinib-only arm, and absence of concurrent administration (drugs were separated by 2 hours), which will require further investigation in future trials."
