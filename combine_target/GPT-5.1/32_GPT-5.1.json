      "briefSummary": "This single‑center, open‑label phase 1/2 trial (MM1636; NCT03047928) evaluated a first‑in‑class immune‑modulatory peptide vaccine (IO102/IO103) targeting indoleamine 2,3‑dioxygenase (IDO) and PD‑L1 in combination with the anti‑PD‑1 antibody nivolumab in patients with advanced/metastatic melanoma who had not previously received anti‑PD‑1 therapy. The rationale is that vaccination activates IDO‑ and PD‑L1‑specific T cells that attack immunosuppressive and tumor cells expressing these molecules, thereby inflaming and \"heating up\" the tumor microenvironment and improving responsiveness to PD‑1 blockade. The primary objective was to assess feasibility and safety; secondary objectives included clinical efficacy and immunogenicity. Thirty patients received subcutaneous IDO/PD‑L1 vaccines plus intravenous nivolumab. The combination showed a toxicity profile comparable to nivolumab monotherapy, with an investigator‑assessed objective response rate of 80% and a complete response rate of 43%, prolonged progression‑free survival, and robust, durable vaccine‑specific T cell responses in blood, skin, and tumors. These findings support further evaluation in larger randomized trials.",
      "detailedDescription": "MM1636 is an investigator‑initiated, nonrandomized, open‑label, single‑center phase 1/2 clinical trial conducted at Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Denmark (NCT03047928; EudraCT 2016‑0004527‑23). The study tests a first‑in‑class immune‑modulatory cancer vaccine strategy that targets non‑mutated immune‑regulatory molecules, indoleamine 2,3‑dioxygenase (IDO) and PD‑L1, in combination with PD‑1 blockade in metastatic melanoma.\n\nRationale and hypothesis: Many patients with metastatic melanoma exhibit primary or acquired resistance to anti‑PD‑1 monotherapy, and combined anti‑PD‑1/anti‑CTLA‑4 therapy, while more effective, is associated with high rates of severe toxicity. IDO and PD‑L1 are expressed by melanoma cells and multiple cell types in the tumor microenvironment, where they contribute to immune suppression. Naturally occurring IDO‑ and PD‑L1‑specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells can recognize and kill IDO+/PD‑L1+ tumor cells and immunosuppressive myeloid or other immune cells, and can secrete pro‑inflammatory cytokines. The trial is based on the hypothesis that vaccination with IDO‑ and PD‑L1‑derived peptides (IO102/IO103) will expand and activate these specific T cells, leading to elimination of IDO/PD‑L1‑expressing immunosuppressive cells, induction of a TH1‑type inflammatory milieu, increased T‑cell infiltration, and adaptive upregulation of PD‑L1, thereby making tumors more susceptible to nivolumab. Preclinical models had shown synergistic antitumor effects of IDO vaccination plus anti‑PD‑1 therapy.\n\nStudy population and design: The full MM1636 trial planned three cohorts: (A) 30 anti‑PD‑1–naïve patients with metastatic melanoma; (B) 10 patients with de novo anti‑PD‑1 resistance; and (C) 10 patients with acquired resistance after anti‑PD‑1 therapy, for a total of 50 patients. The current report describes cohort A only. Eligible patients were adults (≥18 years) with locally advanced or stage IV melanoma (AJCC 7th/8th editions), at least one measurable lesion by RECIST 1.1, ECOG performance status 0–1, and no prior anti‑PD‑1 therapy. Patients with active significant autoimmune disease or CNS metastases >1 cm were excluded. PD‑L1 status, BRAF status, LDH level, and M stage were documented but not used as inclusion criteria. Thirty patients were enrolled between December 2017 and June 2020. Baseline characteristics included mean age 70 years, 60% M1c disease, 37% BRAF‑mutant disease, and 43% PD‑L1–negative tumors (<1% by clone 28‑8). A small proportion (10%) had prior ipilimumab exposure. No patients had brain metastases.\n\nIntervention: The investigational vaccine consists of two synthetic long peptides: IO102, a 21‑mer peptide derived from IDO (DTLLKALLEIASCLEKALQVF), and IO103, a 19‑mer peptide derived from the PD‑L1 signal peptide (FMTYWHLLNAFTVTVPKDL). Each vaccine dose contains 100 μg of IO102 plus 100 μg of IO103, dissolved in DMSO and emulsified in Montanide ISA‑51 adjuvant to a final volume of 1 mL for subcutaneous injection. Nivolumab was administered intravenously at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks for up to 24 cycles; after completion of the vaccination schedule, clinically benefiting patients could continue nivolumab at 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks for up to 2 years as standard of care.\n\nTreatment schedule: Vaccination was given subcutaneously every 2 weeks for the first six injections (induction phase) and then every 4 weeks up to a maximum of 15 injections (approximately 9 months). Nivolumab was started in parallel and continued for a maximum of 24 cycles at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, with optional continuation at 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks thereafter in responders. Patients underwent baseline FDG PET–CT imaging, serial PET–CT every 3 months for response assessment, and, when feasible, tumor needle biopsies at baseline and after six treatment cycles. Delayed‑type hypersensitivity (DTH) tests with peptide injection without adjuvant followed by punch biopsies were performed after six cycles to study skin‑infiltrating lymphocytes (SKILs). Peripheral blood was collected at multiple time points for immunomonitoring.\n\nObjectives and endpoints: The primary objective was to assess feasibility, safety, and tolerability of the IDO/PD‑L1 vaccine plus nivolumab. Secondary objectives included assessment of clinical efficacy (objective response rate, progression‑free survival, overall survival, duration of response) and immunogenicity, including induction, phenotype, and trafficking of IDO‑ and PD‑L1‑specific T cells. Tumor responses were investigator‑assessed using RECIST 1.1 and validated by an independent blinded radiology review. Survival endpoints were analyzed by Kaplan–Meier methods. To explore whether the observed efficacy exceeded that expected from nivolumab alone, outcomes were compared with a matched historical control cohort from the Danish Metastatic Melanoma Database treated with anti‑PD‑1 monotherapy.\n\nSafety and tolerability: Among 30 treated patients, systemic toxicity was comparable to reported profiles of nivolumab monotherapy. Common treatment‑related grade 1–2 adverse events included fatigue, rash, arthralgia, diarrhea, nausea, dry skin, pruritus, infusion reactions, xerostomia, and myalgia. Four patients (13%) experienced grade 3–4 events: maculopapular rash, adrenal insufficiency, arthralgia, and multiple immune‑related toxicities in one patient who died from urosepsis and suspected myocarditis in the setting of severe nivolumab‑related immune adverse events. Local injection‑site reactions occurred in 77% of patients (granulomas, erythema, pain, pruritus), all grade 1–2, and attributed largely to Montanide; two patients discontinued vaccination due to persistent granulomas and tenderness but continued nivolumab. No signal of increased systemic autoimmunity attributable specifically to the vaccine was evident.\n\nClinical efficacy: By investigator review, the overall objective response rate (ORR) was 80% (95% CI, 62.7–90.5%), with 43% (95% CI, 27.4–60.8%) complete responses (CRs) and 37% partial responses (PRs); 20% experienced progressive disease as best response. Responses often occurred early, with 22 of 30 patients achieving an objective response by week 12. Median time to PR was 75 days and to CR 327 days. Independent blinded review confirmed a high ORR of 76.6%, with a 53.3% CR rate. Responses were observed irrespective of PD‑L1 status and HLA genotype: PD‑L1–positive patients (>1%) had an ORR of 94.1%, whereas PD‑L1–negative patients (<1%) had an ORR of 61.5%. At the time of analysis, with a median follow‑up of 22.9 months, median progression‑free survival was 26 months (95% CI, 15.4–69 months) for the whole cohort and not reached among responders; median overall survival had not been reached, with 12‑month OS 81.6%. In comparison, a matched historical control group (n=74) treated with anti‑PD‑1 monotherapy showed an ORR of 41.7%, CR rate of 12%, median PFS of 8.3 months, and median OS of 23.2 months. Weighted logistic and Cox regression analyses indicated significantly higher response and CR rates and prolonged PFS in MM1636, supporting an added effect beyond nivolumab alone, acknowledging limitations of nonrandomized design and potential biases in synthetic control comparisons.\n\nImmunogenicity and mechanistic findings:\n- Peripheral blood: Modified in vitro IFN‑γ ELISPOT assays showed that 33% and 27% of patients had detectable IDO‑ and PD‑L1‑specific T cells at baseline, respectively. During vaccination, 93% of patients exhibited increased IDO‑ or PD‑L1‑specific T cell responses, with statistically significant median increases from baseline. Ex vivo ELISPOT and flow cytometry confirmed frequent induction of CD4+ and CD8+ vaccine‑specific T cells expressing activation and cytolytic markers (CD107a, CD137) and producing IFN‑γ and TNF‑α. Responses fluctuated over time and persisted in many patients 3–6 months after the last vaccination, consistent with memory formation. Vaccine‑specific responses were observed across diverse HLA types.\n- Skin/DTH site: SKIL cultures derived from DTH biopsies after six cycles demonstrated IDO‑ and PD‑L1‑specific T cells in the skin in most tested patients, primarily CD4+ cells with TNF‑α production and degranulation capacity. TCR sequencing of PD‑L1‑specific SKILs showed clonal expansions, and some dominant skin clones were also detected in tumor biopsies, supporting tissue trafficking.\n- Tumor and TCR repertoire: Paired tumor biopsies and serial blood samples from five patients (three responders, two non‑responders) underwent TCRβ CDR3 sequencing and immunohistochemistry. Responders displayed increased T cell fractions and higher densities of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells in tumors after treatment, whereas a non‑responder showed decreased T‑cell infiltration and immune escape via loss of MHC class I and lack of PD‑L1/IDO upregulation. Vaccine‑enriched IDO/PD‑L1‑specific clones identified from peripheral cultures were more frequent in post‑treatment biopsies in most patients, indicating recruitment to tumors. In blood, responders exhibited decreased Simpson clonality and increased richness at early time points, suggestive of broad peripheral expansion and trafficking, while non‑responders showed the opposite. In tumors, responders tended to show increased clonality and decreased richness, consistent with focused expansions of selected T cell clones. Many tumor‑expanded clones were detectable in peripheral blood at baseline and expanded following therapy, suggesting that pre‑existing tumor‑associated T cells were boosted by the combination treatment.\n- Gene expression and checkpoint modulation: NanoString profiling of two responding patients demonstrated increased expression of genes associated with T cell activation, effector function (IFNG, TNF, IL15, IL18), cytotoxicity, and multiple immune checkpoints (PD‑1, PD‑L1, PD‑L2, CTLA‑4, TIM‑3, IDO) in post‑treatment samples, indicative of an inflamed, activated tumor microenvironment. IHC in four patients showed upregulation of PD‑L1, IDO, MHC class I and, in most cases, class II on tumor cells in responders after treatment, but not in the non‑responder.\n- Functional assays: Vaccine‑expanded CD4+ and CD8+ T cell cultures and clones from patients recognized cognate IDO‑ and PD‑L1‑derived peptides, as well as autologous PD‑L1+ or IDO+ tumor cells and tumor‑conditioned myeloid cells, in an antigen‑ and HLA‑restricted, target‑expression–dependent manner. T cells produced IFN‑γ, TNF‑α and displayed degranulation markers upon recognition. PD‑L1‑specific CD4+ T cells recognized autologous tumor cells and CD14+ myeloid cells whose PD‑L1 expression was upregulated by tumor‑conditioned medium. An HLA‑DR‑restricted IDO‑specific CD4+ clone recognized an HLA‑DR‑matched IDO+ monocytic leukemia cell line and autologous myeloid cells, dependent on IDO expression. These data support the concept that vaccine‑induced T cells can directly target both tumor and immunosuppressive myeloid compartments.\n\nOverall, this phase 1/2 study demonstrates that combining an IDO/PD‑L1‑targeting peptide vaccine with nivolumab in anti‑PD‑1–naïve metastatic melanoma patients is feasible, has a safety profile comparable to nivolumab monotherapy aside from expected local vaccine reactions, induces robust and durable vaccine‑specific T cell responses in blood, skin, and tumors, remodels the tumor microenvironment toward a pro‑inflammatory, checkpoint‑rich state, and is associated with a high objective and complete response rate and prolonged progression‑free survival compared to historical nivolumab monotherapy cohorts. The authors conclude that larger randomized trials are required to validate efficacy, better define the vaccine’s independent contribution, and explore its use in anti‑PD‑1‑resistant disease."
