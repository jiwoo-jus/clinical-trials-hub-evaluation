      "briefSummary": "This multicenter, prospective, non-randomized cohort registry in 15 centers in China evaluates whether endovascular recanalization (ER) combined with standard medical therapy (SMT) is feasible, safe, and potentially more effective than SMT alone for patients with symptomatic non-acute intracranial artery occlusion (sNA-ICAO). Consecutive patients with imaging- and clinically-confirmed sNA-ICAO (24 hours to 6 months from onset) are treated either with SMT alone or with ER plus SMT and followed for 2 years. The main outcome is the occurrence of any stroke during follow-up, with additional assessments of mortality, disability, neurologic deficits, and cognitive function.",
      "detailedDescription": "This study is a multicenter, prospective registry, non-randomized cohort trial conducted at 15 centers across China to investigate the technical feasibility and safety of endovascular recanalization (ER) for symptomatic non-acute intracranial artery occlusion (sNA-ICAO). sNA-ICAO refers to intracranial large artery occlusion in patients who remain symptomatic between 24 hours and 6 months after onset, despite standard medical therapy (SMT), and is associated with high morbidity and a high risk of recurrent ischemic events.\n\nEligible patients are identified by clinical evaluation and vascular imaging (MRA, CTA, or DSA) confirming sNA-ICAO. From January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2022, consecutive patients are enrolled and assigned to one of two cohorts based on clinical judgment and patient/family preference: (1) SMT alone or (2) ER plus SMT. Both cohorts share the same inclusion/exclusion criteria and outcome measures. SMT includes dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel for 90 days followed by long-term single antiplatelet therapy, as well as intensive management of vascular risk factors such as blood pressure and LDL cholesterol, lifestyle counseling, and coordination of care for comorbidities.\n\nFor ER, patients receive dual antiplatelet therapy before the procedure. Under general anesthesia, experienced interventional neuroradiologists perform endovascular recanalization using a guiding catheter, microcatheter, and micro guidewire to cross the occluded segment, followed by balloon angioplasty and, when needed, stent implantation to restore vessel patency. Successful revascularization is defined as modified TICI grade 2b or 3 with residual stenosis <50%. For internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (MCA M1) occlusions, ipsilateral hypoperfusion is confirmed by CT or MR perfusion imaging; perfusion data may be processed by the RAPID system using DEFUSE 3 criteria.\n\nAll patients undergo standardized data collection at baseline, including demographics, vascular risk factors, stroke history and symptoms, morphology of the occlusion, time from occlusion and last symptoms to recanalization (for ER patients), functional status (modified Rankin Scale [mRS]), neurological deficits (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS]), and, for anterior circulation lesions, cognitive testing. Cognitive assessment covers memory, executive function, processing speed, and attention/working memory using components of the Chinese version of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale and other tests (animal naming, letter fluency, digit span).\n\nPatients are followed at 30 days, 3 months, 8 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months after enrollment. The primary endpoint is any stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) occurring from enrollment to 2 years. Secondary outcomes include all-cause mortality, mRS score, NIHSS score, and longitudinal cognitive function. Stroke is defined using World Health Organization criteria. Major stroke is defined as an NIHSS score ≥6 at least 30 days after onset, and mild stroke as an NIHSS deterioration of ≤4 points with corresponding diffusion-weighted MRI changes or as adjudicated by a stroke committee. All clinical events are adjudicated by an independent committee blinded to treatment allocation.\n\nThe planned sample size is 160 patients in the ER plus SMT group and 320 in the SMT-alone group (1:2 allocation), based on an expected 2-year ipsilateral ischemic stroke rate of approximately 10% for ER plus SMT and 20% for SMT alone, with 80% power and a 5% two-sided alpha, accounting for non-participation and dropout. Preprocedural complication rates exceeding 15% (e.g., arterial dissection, perforation, thrombus migration, subacute stent thrombosis, hemorrhage, or death) are set as safety termination criteria.\n\nStatistical analyses include descriptive statistics and comparative tests (chi-square, t-test, Mann–Whitney U). Cox proportional hazards models will estimate the risk of mortality and ischemic events. Multivariable models will adjust for age, sex, baseline NIHSS and mRS, baseline cognitive function, medical history, prior ischemic stroke, time from last neurologic event, and occlusion site. Propensity score matching (1:1 nearest neighbor, caliper 0.2 of the propensity score) will be used in sensitivity analyses to address treatment-selection bias, matching on age, baseline neurologic and functional status, cognitive function, occlusion location, and medical history.\n\nData management is centralized under a Scientific Committee, with secure, anonymized, web-based data entry and site-specific access. The study adheres to the Declaration of Helsinki, and all participants provide written informed consent. Ethics approval was obtained from the Beijing Tiantan Hospital ethics committee and institutional review boards of all participating centers. The results are intended to provide higher-level evidence on the role of ER plus SMT versus SMT alone in preventing recurrent stroke and improving functional and cognitive outcomes in patients with sNA-ICAO."

Under general anesthesia, after arterial access and placement of 6- or 8-French guiding catheters, intravenous heparin is administered to maintain activated clotting time between 200 and 300 seconds. A microguidewire and microcatheter are used to traverse the occluded intracranial artery segment, with angiographic confirmation of true lumen position. Balloon angioplasty is then performed; stents are deployed in cases of significant residual stenosis, dissection, or failure to maintain forward flow, with allowance for multiple stents if needed. Successful revascularization is defined as modified TICI 2b or 3 and residual stenosis <50%.
