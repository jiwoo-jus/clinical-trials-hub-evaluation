      "briefSummary": "This retrospective single-center cohort study (RECORGEN) evaluated how well ultrasound-guided conventional radiofrequency (RF) treatment of the genicular nerves reduces chronic anterior knee pain in patients who did not respond to standard medical management. The study included people with knee pain caused by degenerative conditions (such as osteoarthritis or other non-surgical knee pathology) and those with persistent post-surgical pain after procedures like total knee arthroplasty. All patients first had to respond to a diagnostic nerve block before receiving RF. The main goal was to see how many patients reported at least 50% overall improvement at 6 weeks and how long any pain relief lasted. Secondary goals included changes in pain scores, use of strong opioids, functional improvement, need for additional procedures, and safety. About one-third of patients achieved meaningful clinical benefit, with an average duration of pain relief of about 8 months, and the procedure showed a favorable safety profile.",
      "detailedDescription": "The RECORGEN trial is a retrospective observational cohort study conducted at the multidisciplinary chronic pain center of Hospital Oost-Limburg (Genk, Belgium) between September 1, 2017, and June 30, 2020. It investigates the effectiveness and safety of ultrasound-guided conventional radiofrequency (RF) ablation of the genicular nerves in patients with chronic anterior knee pain that is refractory to conventional medical management.\n\nTwo main etiologic subgroups were studied: (1) patients with persistent post-surgical knee pain (PPSP), most commonly following total knee arthroplasty (TKA), and (2) patients with degenerative knee pain (DP), including osteoarthritis, soft-tissue (e.g., ligament) disease, and post-traumatic knee pain. Patients with chronic widespread pain were excluded. Each treated knee (including bilateral and repeat procedures) was analyzed as a separate observation.\n\nBefore RF, all patients underwent diagnostic blocks of the superomedial, inferomedial, and superolateral genicular nerves using 2% lidocaine (1 ml per nerve). A positive response was defined as at least 50% pain reduction. Patients with a positive diagnostic response subsequently received conventional RF ablation of the same three genicular nerves. RF was performed under ultrasound guidance in sterile conditions without sedation, using a 10 cm 21G Cosman cannula with a 5 mm active tip. Sensory stimulation was used to confirm proximity to the target nerve (threshold \u001e0.5 V), and motor stimulation at 1.0 V was used to avoid motor fibers. RF lesions were applied at 70\u0000b0C for 90 seconds per nerve.\n\nBaseline data collection included age, sex, pain intensity on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), pain duration, indication (PPSP vs degenerative pain), use of strong opioids (all opioids except tramadol and codeine), and history of knee surgery. Follow-up assessments were performed at 6 weeks post-procedure for the entire cohort, and at a later cross-sectional \"second time point\" (up to 27 months after RF) only for patients who reported treatment success at 6 weeks.\n\nThe primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with treatment success at 6 weeks, defined as a global perceived effect (GPE) of at least 50% improvement compared with baseline. GPE was rated from 0% to 100%. Secondary endpoints included: (1) proportion of patients with treatment success at the second time point; (2) proportion of patients achieving at least 50% reduction in NRS pain at 6 weeks and at the second time point; (3) subjective functional improvement at the second time point; (4) duration of the treatment effect in months; (5) changes in strong opioid use at 6 weeks and at the second time point; (6) need for additional invasive treatments (e.g., injections, platelet-rich plasma, surgery); and (7) adverse events (AEs) including type, frequency, and severity.\n\nIn total, 68 RF procedures were initially identified, with 61 included after exclusion of patients with chronic widespread pain. Fifty-nine procedures (13 degenerative pain, 46 PPSP) had complete 6-week follow-up and formed the main analysis set. Nineteen of 59 (32.2%) achieved the predefined treatment success based on GPE at 6 weeks, with similar success rates in degenerative (30.8%) and PPSP (32.6%) subgroups. Overall, 42.4% had some degree of improvement on GPE. NRS scores decreased significantly from a mean of 7.4 at baseline to 6.0 at 6 weeks (p=0.001) in the total cohort. A reduction in NRS of at least 50% at 6 weeks was observed in 22% of patients.\n\nResponders at 6 weeks were contacted by mail and telephone in October 2020 to obtain cross-sectional long-term outcome data. The mean time to this second assessment was 17 months (SD 10). Of the 19 initial responders, 17 provided follow-up data. At this second time point, 35.3% still met the GPE treatment success criterion, and 45.1% maintained a positive effect. The mean duration of RF treatment effect in the whole cohort was 8.3 months (SD 6.8). Some patients with temporary benefit received rescue treatments such as platelet-rich plasma or intra-articular corticosteroid injections; no patients proceeded to TKA during the observation window.\n\nConcerning functional outcomes, nearly half (47.1%) of the patients with initial treatment success reported improved functionality at the second time point, and most of them also reported ongoing pain improvement. Strong opioid use decreased from 27.1% of patients at baseline to 18.6% at 6 weeks, irrespective of treatment success, possibly reflecting optimization of non-cancer pain management. At long-term follow-up, 35.3% of followed patients used strong opioids, with some new initiations and some discontinuations, particularly within the PPSP group.\n\nThe safety profile of ultrasound-guided genicular nerve RF was generally favorable. At 6 weeks, therapy-related AEs were reported in 15.3% of patients, predominantly mild, localized, and transient. The most frequent AE was hypoesthesia (6.8%). Other isolated AEs included gait instability, increased pain, a self-limiting hematoma, and a flare of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) in a PPSP patient, the latter classified as a serious adverse event. At the second time point, no new AEs were reported; one patient noted persistent lateral knee paresthesia, while others reported resolution of earlier sensory symptoms.\n\nThe study highlights that conventional RF of three genicular nerves produces meaningful clinical benefit in slightly more than 30% of patients with refractory degenerative knee pain or PPSP in a real-world setting, with an average duration of effect of about 8 months and a low incidence of serious complications. The authors discuss potential reasons for lower success rates compared to earlier, mostly fluoroscopy-guided, prospective RF studies in osteoarthritis, including heterogeneity of the degenerative group, younger mean age, a learning curve for an ultrasound-guided technique, altered nerve anatomy and neuropathic mechanisms in PPSP, and the limited targeting of only three of the multiple genicular nerves innervating the anterior knee. They suggest that future research should refine patient selection, incorporate updated anatomical knowledge to target additional genicular branches, and evaluate long-term outcomes in larger, prospective cohorts."
