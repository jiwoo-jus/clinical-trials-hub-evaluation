      "briefSummary": "This phase 3, double‑blind, randomized clinical trial compared a new 3‑antigen hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine (3A‑HBV, containing pre‑S1, pre‑S2, and S antigens) with a standard single‑antigen HBV vaccine (1A‑HBV, containing only the S antigen) in healthy adults aged 18 to 45 years. Participants received intramuscular injections on days 0, 28, and 168 and were followed for 48 weeks. The main goals were to show that different manufacturing lots of the 3A‑HBV vaccine produced consistent antibody responses and that the 3A‑HBV vaccine was at least as effective as, and potentially better than, the standard vaccine in achieving protective antibody levels against HBV. The study also compared safety and short‑term side effects between the two vaccines.",
      "detailedDescription": "This multicenter, phase 3, double‑blind, randomized, controlled trial evaluated the immunogenicity, manufacturing equivalence, and safety of a 3‑antigen hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine (3A‑HBV; also known as Sci‑B‑Vac) compared with a conventional single‑antigen HBV vaccine (1A‑HBV) in healthy adults 18 to 45 years of age. The trial was conducted at 37 community clinics and academic hospitals in Canada, Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States between December 2017 and October 2019, with follow‑up to 48 weeks after the first vaccination.\n\nParticipants were in stable health, HBV‑seronegative at baseline, and were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive one of three consecutively manufactured lots (A, B, or C) of 3A‑HBV or the comparator 1A‑HBV. Randomization was stratified by study center, and investigators and participants were blinded to group allocation. Vaccines were administered intramuscularly on days 0, 28, and 168 (three‑dose schedule). The 3A‑HBV vaccine is produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and contains virus‑like particles comprising the three HBV surface antigens (pre‑S1, pre‑S2, and S) in glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms, at a dose of 10 μg per 1‑mL injection, adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide adjuvant (0.5 mg/mL aluminum). The comparator 1A‑HBV is a yeast‑derived recombinant HBsAg‑S vaccine containing 20 μg HBsAg‑S in 1 mL, adsorbed to 0.5 mg aluminum hydroxide.\n\nThe primary objective was to demonstrate manufacturing equivalence (lot‑to‑lot consistency) of the three 3A‑HBV lots in terms of immunogenicity, measured by geometric mean concentration (GMC) of antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti‑HBs) 4 weeks after the third dose (day 196). Lot‑to‑lot consistency was predefined as the 2‑sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each pairwise GMC ratio (lot A vs B, A vs C, B vs C) falling between 0.67 and 1.50.\n\nA key secondary objective was to show that the seroprotection rate (SPR) of the pooled 3A‑HBV lots after three doses (day 196) was noninferior to the SPR of the 1A‑HBV vaccine. Seroprotection was defined as an anti‑HBs concentration ≥10 mIU/mL. Noninferiority was concluded if the lower bound of the 2‑sided 95% CI for the difference in SPR (3A‑HBV minus 1A‑HBV) was greater than −5%. Exploratory endpoints included comparison of SPR and GMC after two doses (day 168), the proportion of participants achieving anti‑HBs ≥100 mIU/mL, and comparisons of two doses of 3A‑HBV versus three doses of 1A‑HBV using a −10% margin in an exploratory analysis.\n\nImmunogenicity analyses used per‑protocol sets restricted to participants who were seronegative at baseline, received all three doses within defined windows (for one of the sets), had evaluable serum samples at baseline and at the relevant time point, and had no major protocol deviations. GMCs were estimated using analysis of covariance on log10‑transformed titers, with vaccine lot as a factor and baseline titer as a covariate. SPRs and differences in SPRs between groups were estimated with exact confidence intervals and the Miettinen–Nurminen method.\n\nSafety and reactogenicity were assessed in all participants who received at least one vaccine dose (safety set). Solicited local and systemic adverse events (AEs) within 7 days after any injection were recorded, along with unsolicited AEs within 28 days, serious adverse events (SAEs), and AEs leading to discontinuation throughout the study (up to day 336). Reactogenicity focused on expected local symptoms (such as injection site pain, tenderness, erythema, swelling, pruritus) and systemic symptoms.\n\nA total of 2838 adults were randomized: 712 to 1A‑HBV and 2126 to 3A‑HBV (lots A, B, and C combined). The mean age was 33.5 years, 57.8% were women, and most participants were White. High adherence to the 3‑dose schedule was observed, with 93.0% of participants receiving all three vaccinations. Lot‑to‑lot consistency was demonstrated: all pairwise anti‑HBs GMC ratios at day 196 had 95% CIs within 0.67–1.50 (e.g., lot A vs B ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.67–1.00; lot A vs C ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.78–1.15; lot B vs C ratio 1.16, 95% CI 0.95–1.41).\n\nThe pooled 3A‑HBV group showed an SPR of 99.3% (95% CI, 98.8%–99.6%) at day 196 compared with 94.8% (95% CI, 92.7%–96.4%) for 1A‑HBV. The difference in SPR (3A‑HBV minus 1A‑HBV) was 4.5% (95% CI, 2.9%–6.6%), meeting the noninferiority criterion and demonstrating superior seroprotection. After two doses (day 168), SPR was 90.4% (95% CI, 89.0%–91.8%) with 3A‑HBV versus 51.6% (95% CI, 47.5%–55.6%) with 1A‑HBV, indicating faster onset of protection with the 3‑antigen vaccine. The GMC of anti‑HBs at day 168 was 118.8 mIU/mL for 3A‑HBV vs 15.1 mIU/mL for 1A‑HBV (GMC ratio 7.9), and at day 196, 5442.4 mIU/mL vs 1567.2 mIU/mL (GMC ratio 3.5). A higher proportion of participants in the 3A‑HBV group achieved anti‑HBs ≥100 mIU/mL at all post‑vaccination time points.\n\nNonresponse (anti‑HBs <10 mIU/mL after three doses at day 196) was rare in the 3A‑HBV group (0.7%) compared with the 1A‑HBV group (5.2%), consistent with improved immunogenicity, particularly relevant for populations with historically lower responses to standard single‑antigen HBV vaccines. The enhanced immunogenicity is attributed to inclusion of pre‑S1 and pre‑S2 domains and mammalian‑cell expression, which may offer broader T‑helper epitopes and more physiologic glycosylation.\n\nReactogenicity was higher with 3A‑HBV, mainly due to more frequent local injection site pain and tenderness, but events were generally mild to moderate and of short duration (median 1–2 days for local and ≤2 days for systemic symptoms). Within 7 days after any injection, solicited local AEs were reported in 85.0% of 3A‑HBV recipients vs 65.9% of 1A‑HBV recipients; solicited systemic AEs occurred in 68.0% vs 60.1%, respectively. The incidence of solicited AEs did not increase with successive doses. The proportion of participants with unsolicited AEs and overall SAE rates were low, and no vaccine‑related SAEs were identified during the study period. Study discontinuation due to AEs was rare (approximately 0.5% in 3A‑HBV and 0.3% in 1A‑HBV).\n\nOverall, the trial demonstrated that the 3‑antigen HBV vaccine has consistent manufacturing performance, superior or noninferior seroprotection rates compared with a standard single‑antigen vaccine, more rapid induction of protective antibody levels after two doses, and an acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile in young healthy adults. These findings support the use of 3A‑HBV for prevention of hepatitis B infection in adults, particularly in populations where rapid and robust seroprotection is desirable."
