      "briefSummary": "This single-center, first-in-human randomized pilot phase II trial evaluated the safety, immune effects, and antitumor activity of an autologous dendritic cell vaccine targeting non‑mutated tumor blood vessel antigens (DLK1, EphA2, HBB, NRP1, RGS5, TEM1) combined with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib in HLA‑A2–positive patients with advanced melanoma who had no standard options and were mostly resistant to prior PD‑1 blockade. Monocyte‑derived type‑1 polarized dendritic cells (αDC1) were loaded with HLA‑A2‑restricted TBVA peptides and injected intradermally every two weeks. Patients were randomized to start oral dasatinib (70 mg twice daily) either immediately with the first vaccine cycle (Arm B) or delayed to week 5 (Arm A). Primary endpoint was peripheral blood T‑cell response to vaccine peptides; secondary endpoints included objective clinical response, progression‑free and overall survival, and exploratory analyses of blood, tumor, and serum immune biomarkers. The combination was safe and induced coordinated vaccine‑specific and broader (epitope‑spreading) CD8+ T‑cell responses in a subset of patients, which correlated with partial responses or stable disease, TCR convergence, an inflamed tumor microenvironment, and features of tertiary lymphoid structure formation, with better outcomes in the immediate‑dasatinib arm.",
      "detailedDescription": "This prospective, single‑center randomized pilot phase II clinical trial (UPCI 12‑048; NCT01876212) tested a combination immunotherapy strategy in HLA‑A2–positive patients with advanced stage (IIC–IV) cutaneous, mucosal, or uveal melanoma for whom standard curative or palliative options were exhausted or ineffective. Most enrolled patients had previously progressed on PD‑1–based immune checkpoint blockade. The investigational regimen consisted of autologous monocyte‑derived type‑1 polarized dendritic cells (αDC1) pulsed with a mixture of six HLA‑A2‑restricted peptides derived from overexpressed, non‑mutated tumor blood vessel antigens (TBVA: DLK1, EphA2, HBB, NRP1, RGS5, TEM1), administered intradermally near nodal basins in the extremities every two weeks, combined with the oral Src/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib at 70 mg twice daily.\n\nPatients were randomized to two arms differing only in dasatinib timing: Arm A received vaccine alone in cycle 1, followed by addition of dasatinib starting week 5 (cycle 2), whereas Arm B started dasatinib on day 1 of cycle 1 concurrently with vaccination. Each treatment cycle was one month, with vaccinations on days 1 and 15, and treatment continued for at least six cycles or until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or clinical deterioration. The trial was closed early due to expiration of grant support rather than safety concerns.\n\nThe primary endpoint was immunologic: induction of peripheral blood T‑cell responses to vaccine TBVA peptides assessed by standardized IFN‑γ ELISPOT. A positive immune response required a >2‑fold increase from baseline and ≥10 specific spots per 10^5 cells for at least three distinct vaccine peptides at any on‑treatment time point. Secondary endpoints included safety (CTCAE v4.0), investigator‑assessed objective clinical response (RECIST v1.1), objective response rate, progression‑free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and exploratory correlative studies of regulatory T cells and myeloid‑derived suppressor cells in blood, vascular and immune gene expression in tumor biopsies, and serum biomarkers such as CXCL10 and soluble checkpoint molecules. Tumor biopsies were obtained at baseline and at week 5, and peripheral blood was collected every two weeks.\n\nSixteen patients were accrued; 14 received at least one vaccination plus planned dasatinib, and 13 were evaluable for the primary and key secondary endpoints. Among these 13 patients, 6 developed vaccine‑specific CD8+ T‑cell responses to ≥3 TBVA peptides, often detectable by week 3 and fluctuating over time, and all six had preferred clinical outcomes (four partial responses and two stable disease). Seven patients failed to mount vaccine‑specific responses; these patients generally experienced progressive disease, with only one stable case. Patients in Arm B (immediate dasatinib) had higher immune response and objective response rates and longer median OS (about 15–19 months vs ~3–8 months) and PFS (~7.9 vs ~2 months) compared with Arm A (delayed dasatinib), suggesting that dasatinib acts as an in vivo adjuvant during the priming phase.\n\nThe study documented epitope spreading: in immunologic responders, CD8+ T‑cell reactivity broadened to non‑vaccine, disease‑relevant HLA‑A2‑restricted peptides derived from melanoma differentiation antigens (MART‑1, gp100, tyrosinase) and additional vascular antigens (NRP1, PDGFRβ, VEGFR1, VEGFR2). The extent and magnitude of responses to both vaccine and non‑vaccine peptides correlated with improved PFS and OS. High levels of T‑cell receptor (TCR) convergence in peripheral blood, at baseline and especially on treatment, were associated with vaccine responsiveness, longer PFS and OS, and partial responses, whereas overall TCR evenness (oligoclonality) was not predictive.\n\nSafety analysis showed that the combination regimen was generally well tolerated; no treatment‑related adverse events exceeded grade 3. The observed adverse events were consistent with the known profile of dasatinib (e.g., anemia, fatigue, hyponatremia, nausea, cytopenias, rash), with some events more frequent in the immediate‑dasatinib arm.\n\nExploratory correlative studies examined the αDC1 product, blood, and tumor microenvironment. Conventional phenotypic release markers of αDC1 (e.g., CD11c, CD80/83/86, CCR7, HLA‑DR, IL‑12/IL‑10 secretion) did not distinguish vaccines from responders versus non‑responders. However, gene expression profiling of vaccine αDC1 identified transcriptional signatures enriched in responders, including genes linked to mature antigen‑presenting cell function, type I/II interferon signaling, lymphoid organization, and cell survival (e.g., GM‑CSF, LAMP3, RELB, BTNL8, CXCR3, IRF3, LTB, TRAF1/2), and depletion of genes associated with immature or tolerogenic DC, apoptosis, or immunosuppression (e.g., CD47, IL18BP, LAIR, PTGER2, RGS5, TGFBI). These patterns suggest functional heterogeneity of autologous DC vaccines that may affect clinical efficacy.\n\nTumor biopsies profiled using the Oncomine Immune Response Research Assay and a custom NanoString panel revealed that baseline tumors from responders exhibited an inflamed, immunologically \"hot\" phenotype, with higher expression of antigen presentation and costimulation molecules (CD80, CD86, HLA‑DMB, ICOSLG), chemokines and receptors linked to immune cell recruitment (CCL3, CCR5, CMKLR1), and innate and adaptive immune effector markers (e.g., NK cell receptors NCR1, NCR3, KIR2DL2, cytotoxic granule components). In contrast, poor‑outcome tumors expressed higher levels of genes linked to hypoxia/acidosis (CA4) and anti‑apoptotic pathways (BCL2). On treatment, responders showed transcriptional shifts consistent with decreased hypoxia/glycolysis (lower HIF1A, IRS1), increased infiltration by diverse immune subsets (B cells, monocytes, macrophages, NK cells, secretory/cytotoxic cells), and reduced expression of genes promoting tumor proliferation, DNA repair, metastasis, and immune suppression in non‑responders.\n\nA notable finding was the emergence, only in responding patients, of a tumor transcriptional biosignature indicative of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), including increased expression of CCL19, CCL21, LTA, LTB, TNFSF14, CXCL10, IFNG, CD8A, CD20, CHST4, FUT4, LAMP3, TBX21, and CD274/PD‑L1. Although histologic confirmation was not feasible due to limited tissue, this TLS‑like signature strongly correlated with epitope spreading in peripheral CD8+ T cells and better survival, suggesting that successful vaccination plus dasatinib can remodel the tumor microenvironment to support local priming and diversification of antitumor T‑cell responses.\n\nThe study concludes that vaccination against non‑mutated tumor blood vessel antigens using autologous αDC1, combined with dasatinib as a systemic immune and microenvironmental modulator, is safe, immunogenic, and shows promising clinical activity in heavily pretreated, largely checkpoint‑refractory advanced melanoma, particularly when dasatinib is started concurrently with vaccination. The data support further evaluation of this strategy, including in planned phase II trials in melanoma and clear‑cell renal cell carcinoma, and highlight TCR convergence, epitope spreading, DC transcriptomic signatures, and TLS‑associated tumor profiles as potential biomarkers of response."
