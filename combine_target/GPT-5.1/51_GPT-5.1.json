      "briefSummary": "This phase I, open-label, dose‑escalation study evaluated the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the ErbB family blocker afatinib given continuously with radiotherapy, either with or without the chemotherapy drug temozolomide, in adults with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Patients received standard brain radiotherapy plus afatinib, and depending on MGMT promoter methylation status and a protocol amendment, some also received concomitant and maintenance temozolomide. The main goal was to identify the highest tolerable afatinib dose in each regimen based on dose‑limiting toxicities, and to describe safety, preliminary antitumor activity, and pharmacokinetics.",
      "detailedDescription": "This was a phase I, open‑label, 3+3 dose‑escalation trial (NCT00977431) conducted at five centers in the United Kingdom in adults (18–69 years) with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed WHO grade 4 malignant glioma (glioblastoma multiforme) and known O6‑methylguanine‑DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status or available tumor material for testing. Key exclusions included recent surgery (within 2 weeks), prior cranial radiotherapy, placement of a Gliadel wafer, and concurrent investigational drugs.\n\nTwo treatment regimens were investigated:\n- Regimen M: afatinib plus temozolomide in combination with radiotherapy in patients initially selected for methylated MGMT promoter status.\n- Regimen U: afatinib plus radiotherapy without temozolomide in patients initially selected for unmethylated MGMT promoter status.\n\nAfter evidence emerged that temozolomide is beneficial regardless of MGMT status, the protocol was amended so that, once the MTD was defined for regimen U, all subsequent patients received regimen M irrespective of MGMT methylation.\n\nIn both regimens, external‑beam radiotherapy was delivered at 2 Gy per fraction, 5 days per week for 6 weeks (total 60 Gy). Afatinib was given orally once daily in escalating cohorts of 20, 30, and 40 mg during the 6‑week radiotherapy phase, and then continued at 40 mg/day as maintenance until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In regimen M, patients also received temozolomide 75 mg/m² daily during radiotherapy, followed by a 4‑week break, then up to six 28‑day cycles of maintenance temozolomide (150 mg/m² in cycle 1 and 200 mg/m² in cycles 2–6, days 1–5 of each cycle).\n\nDose‑limiting toxicities (DLTs) were predefined adverse events or laboratory abnormalities attributed to afatinib occurring during the 6‑week radiotherapy phase. If a DLT occurred, afatinib was interrupted and could be resumed at a reduced dose if toxicity resolved to baseline or CTCAE grade 1 within 14 days; otherwise, afatinib was discontinued. The MTD was defined as the highest afatinib dose at which no more than one of six evaluable patients experienced a DLT (DLT incidence ≤17%). Patients missing substantial afatinib exposure during radiotherapy for reasons other than DLT were replaced for MTD assessment.\n\nThe primary endpoint was determination of the MTD of continuous daily afatinib in combination with radiotherapy, with or without concomitant temozolomide. Secondary endpoints included incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs, objective tumor response by Macdonald criteria on serial MRI, and pharmacokinetics of afatinib at steady state (trough levels on days 8, 15, and 29). Time to disease progression (TTP) was analyzed post hoc using Kaplan–Meier methods.\n\nOf 55 enrolled patients, 36 received at least one dose of study medication (regimen M: n=20; regimen U: n=16) and were included in safety and efficacy analyses. In regimen M, afatinib 20 mg and then 40 mg were initially tested; DLTs at 40 mg (grade 4 thrombocytopenia and grade 3 vomiting) led to evaluation of an intermediate 30‑mg dose, at which no DLTs occurred. Thus, the MTD for afatinib with radiotherapy plus daily temozolomide was 30 mg/day during radiotherapy (with 40 mg/day as post‑RT maintenance). In regimen U, afatinib was escalated from 20 mg to 40 mg; with only one DLT (grade 3 diarrhea) among six evaluable patients at 40 mg, the MTD for afatinib with radiotherapy alone was 40 mg/day.\n\nToxicities were consistent with the known profiles of afatinib, radiotherapy, and temozolomide. The most frequent AEs in both regimens were diarrhea and rash, with nausea prominent in the temozolomide‑containing regimen. A high proportion of patients experienced drug‑related AEs, and afatinib was discontinued in a substantial minority due to toxicity or progression. Grade ≥3 treatment‑related events and serious AEs were common, but no new safety signals were identified. In regimen U, three fatal AEs (bacterial meningitis, pneumonia, and disease progression) occurred but were not considered related to afatinib.\n\nAlthough efficacy was not a primary objective, preliminary activity was observed. In the temozolomide‑containing regimen (M), 25% of patients achieved an objective response (including one complete response) and 55% achieved stable disease; median time to progression was 434 days (95% CI 205–not estimable). In the radiotherapy‑only regimen (U), 6% of patients had an objective response and 50% had stable disease; median time to progression was 211 days (95% CI 101–not estimable). It is not possible to attribute this activity specifically to afatinib given the concurrent standard therapies.\n\nThe study concludes that afatinib can be combined with standard radiotherapy (with or without temozolomide) in newly diagnosed GBM at MTDs of 30 mg/day (with concomitant temozolomide) and 40 mg/day (without temozolomide), with a manageable safety profile and pharmacokinetics similar to single‑agent afatinib. Given the modest overall efficacy of ErbB inhibitors in unselected GBM and the association of EGFR alterations with afatinib benefit in prior work, the authors emphasize the need for biomarker‑based patient selection (e.g., EGFR amplification or specific EGFR mutations) in future GBM trials of afatinib and related agents."
