      "briefSummary": "This randomized, within-subject, crossover clinical trial tests whether immersive virtual reality (VR) therapy is a safe, feasible, and effective non-drug treatment for acute pain in adults hospitalized with traumatic injuries, including mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). Each participant completes three 20‑minute sessions in random order: an immersive VR ocean-reef experience, a non‑immersive tablet-based version of the same content, and a VR headset with no content (sensory deprivation control). Pain intensity and unpleasantness, anxiety, physiological pain-related measures (such as heart rate, respiratory rate, pupillometry, and heart rate variability), and subjective experience are measured before and after each session. The main hypothesis is that immersive VR will reduce pain more than the control conditions and will be safe and tolerable in this acute trauma population.",
      "detailedDescription": "This study addresses the need for effective non-pharmacological analgesic strategies to help reduce opioid use in the acute care setting, particularly among patients with traumatic injuries and traumatic brain injury (TBI), who are at high risk for persistent opioid use and opioid use disorder. Virtual reality (VR) has shown promise as an adjunctive pain therapy in other medical contexts, but its safety, feasibility, and efficacy in patients with acute traumatic injuries, especially those with TBI, are not well established.\n\nThe trial is designed as a randomized, within-subject, crossover clinical study conducted at the R. Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore, Maryland. Sixty adult inpatients with traumatic injuries (including mild TBI) are planned for enrollment. Participants must be at least 18 years old, have a Glasgow Coma Score of 15, report pain of at least 3/10 within 24 hours of enrollment, and be expected to remain hospitalized for at least 12 hours. Key exclusions include inability to consent, history of seizure or known intolerance of VR, pregnancy, and non‑English-speaking status.\n\nEach participant undergoes three different 20‑minute intervention sessions, separated by at least 4 hours and administered in randomized order:\n1. Immersive VR experience: theBlu (WEVR), a calming, dynamic coral reef environment delivered via an Oculus Rift head‑mounted display.\n2. Non‑immersive 2D mimic: a recording of theBlu presented on a tablet, controlling for content but not immersion.\n3. VR sensory deprivation: wearing the Oculus Rift headset with no visual content, controlling for external sensory isolation.\n\nBefore starting the session series, participants complete baseline assessments including prior VR exposure and expectations of VR’s analgesic potential, as well as validated questionnaires: the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Multidimensional State Boredom Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Opioid Risk Tool, and Multidimensional Iowa Suggestibility Scale. These measures are used to explore whether traits such as catastrophic thinking, boredom, anxiety/depression, opioid risk, and suggestibility predict response to VR.\n\nBefore and after each of the three sessions, participants complete a survey capturing numerical rating scales for overall pain, headache, neck/back pain, nausea, dizziness, and light sensitivity, as well as the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (state form). After each session, gaming immersion is assessed with the Brockmyer Gaming Engagement Questionnaire. Vital signs including heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and pupillometry measures are recorded pre- and post-session, and continuous heart rate monitoring is performed during sessions when possible. Chart review captures participant chronic pain history, prehospital opioid use, and in-hospital opioid dosing and routine pain scores.\n\nThe primary outcome is the change in pain severity, measured by the numeric rating scale, pre- to post-session, comparing immersive VR with the two control conditions. Exploratory secondary outcomes include opioid usage, durability of analgesia after sessions, pain assessed via the Trauma Function and Comfort Assessment, changes in anxiety and other affective measures, autonomic markers (such as pupillary maximum constriction velocity, relative constriction amplitude, and heart rate variability), and subjective experience of each intervention. The study also examines whether factors such as gaming engagement, boredom, suggestibility, pain catastrophizing, and anxiety/depression correlate with magnitude of pain reduction under VR.\n\nSafety and feasibility of immersive VR in the acute trauma and TBI population are carefully monitored. Potential risks of VR such as seizures, motion sickness, nausea, and dizziness are assessed during and after each session. If seizures occur, participation is terminated and the clinical team is notified; adverse events are documented and included in safety analyses. Intolerance of the headset or increased nausea/dizziness is recorded as part of feasibility assessment. The clinical care team, which manages all analgesic orders, is blinded to session order. If pain is inadequately controlled during the inpatient stay, additional analgesia is prescribed by the clinical team independently of the research protocol.\n\nThe target sample size of 60 participants allows for an anticipated 30% dropout, yielding 42 completers. This provides approximately 80% power to detect a clinically meaningful difference in pain reduction (defined as about a 33% reduction or 2‑point change on a 0–10 scale) at a one‑sided 0.05 significance level. Mixed-effects linear models will be used to analyze pain and other outcomes over time, accommodating missing data, which are common in a trauma population. Correlations between baseline psychological measures and pain response will be examined using Pearson’s correlation.\n\nThe study protocol is approved by the University of Maryland Baltimore Institutional Review Board (protocol HP-00090603) and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04356963). Data are stored securely in accordance with institutional policies, and adverse events are reviewed weekly by the principal investigator. An interim safety analysis is planned once 20 patients with TBI and 20 without TBI have been enrolled. The overarching goal is to determine whether immersive VR can serve as a safe, feasible, and effective adjunctive analgesic in the acute phase after traumatic injury, potentially contributing to opioid-sparing pain management strategies."
