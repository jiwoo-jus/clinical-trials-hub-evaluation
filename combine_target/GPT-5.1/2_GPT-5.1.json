      "briefSummary": "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial evaluated whether a single subcutaneous dose of 0.6 mg dasiglucagon, a ready-to-use glucagon analog in aqueous formulation, can rapidly and safely reverse severe hypoglycemia in adults with type 1 diabetes. During controlled, insulin-induced hypoglycemia in an inpatient setting, 170 adults with type 1 diabetes were randomized 2:1:1 to dasiglucagon, placebo, or reconstituted lyophilized glucagon. The main outcome was how long it took for blood glucose to rise by at least 20 mg/dL after dosing without needing intravenous glucose. Dasiglucagon significantly shortened time to glucose recovery compared with placebo and showed similar efficacy and safety to standard reconstituted glucagon, with nausea and vomiting as the most common side effects. The ready-to-use aqueous formulation is intended to overcome practical barriers associated with current glucagon emergency kits that require reconstitution.",
      "detailedDescription": "This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial investigated the efficacy and safety of dasiglucagon, a next-generation glucagon analog formulated as a ready-to-use aqueous solution for subcutaneous injection, for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in adults with type 1 diabetes. Dasiglucagon is a 29–amino acid peptide with seven substitutions relative to native glucagon to enhance physical and chemical stability in aqueous media, enabling storage and administration without reconstitution.\n\nAdults aged 18–75 years with type 1 diabetes, HbA1c <10%, and on stable insulin therapy were enrolled. Key exclusions included prior dasiglucagon exposure, allergy to trial products, recent severe hypoglycemia (within 1 month) or hypoglycemia with seizure (within 1 year), and use of certain concomitant medications (e.g., β-blockers, indomethacin, warfarin, anticholinergics). Participants underwent an inpatient dosing visit during which insulin-induced hypoglycemia was generated using an intravenous insulin glulisine infusion adjusted to produce a controlled decline in plasma glucose to a target of approximately 55 mg/dL.\n\nA total of 170 participants were randomized 2:1:1 to receive a single subcutaneous dose of either 0.6 mg dasiglucagon, placebo, or 1.0 mg reconstituted lyophilized glucagon (GlucaGen) during controlled hypoglycemia. Randomization was stratified by injection site (abdomen, buttocks, or thigh) and used a fixed-block scheme. Because the investigational medications differed in appearance, preparation and administration were performed by unblinded staff not involved in assessments; participants and investigators remained blinded.\n\nThe primary endpoint was the time from dosing to plasma glucose recovery, defined as the first increase in plasma glucose of at least 20 mg/dL (1.1 mmol/L) from baseline (time of injection) without the need for rescue intravenous glucose; participants not achieving recovery within 45 minutes or requiring rescue glucose were considered nonrecovered. A supportive analysis used linear interpolation between sampling time points to estimate the true time of achieving a 20 mg/dL rise. Key secondary endpoints included the proportion of participants achieving plasma glucose recovery within fixed time windows (10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes) and the change in plasma glucose from baseline at those time points. Statistical analyses included Kaplan–Meier methods and stratified log-rank tests for time-to-event outcomes and ANCOVA for continuous glucose changes, with a hierarchical testing strategy to control multiplicity.\n\nAmong 168 treated participants (82 dasiglucagon, 43 placebo, 43 glucagon), baseline demographics and diabetes characteristics were similar across groups. Median time to plasma glucose recovery was 10 minutes (95% CI 10, 10) with dasiglucagon versus 40 minutes (95% CI 30, 40) with placebo (P < 0.001); the reference glucagon product showed a median recovery time of 12 minutes (95% CI 10, 12). Using interpolated times, median recovery was 9.0 minutes for dasiglucagon, 33.7 minutes for placebo, and 10.0 minutes for glucagon. A high proportion of dasiglucagon-treated participants recovered rapidly: 65%, 99%, and 99% recovered within 10, 15, and 20 minutes, respectively. These rates were significantly superior to placebo at all evaluated time points and comparable to reconstituted glucagon (49%, 95%, and 98% at 10, 15, and 20 minutes). Rescue intravenous glucose was not required in any dasiglucagon or glucagon recipients but was needed in 16% of placebo-treated participants.\n\nDasiglucagon produced a rapid and robust increase in plasma glucose. Mean plasma glucose rise from baseline at 30 minutes was approximately 90.9 mg/dL with dasiglucagon versus 19.1 mg/dL with placebo and 88.5 mg/dL with glucagon. Injection site (abdomen, buttock, thigh) did not significantly affect time to recovery.\n\nSafety assessments demonstrated that dasiglucagon was generally well tolerated with a profile similar to reconstituted glucagon. The most common adverse events judged related to study drug were nausea, vomiting, and headache, occurring with comparable frequency in the dasiglucagon and glucagon groups. Nausea typically began 1–3 hours after dosing and resolved within about 3 hours; vomiting occurred later (mostly 2–3 hours postdose) and was also transient. Injection-site reactions were infrequent, mild, and transient. No serious or fatal adverse events occurred. Antidrug antibody assessments revealed that one dasiglucagon-treated participant developed low-titer, nonneutralizing, non–cross-reactive antibodies at 28 days, which were no longer detectable at 17 months.\n\nThe trial demonstrates that subcutaneous dasiglucagon at 0.6 mg provides rapid and effective reversal of insulin-induced hypoglycemia in adults with type 1 diabetes, with efficacy comparable to reconstituted glucagon and a similar safety and tolerability profile. Because dasiglucagon is supplied as a stable, ready-to-use aqueous formulation that does not require reconstitution, it may mitigate important real-world barriers to glucagon use, such as the complexity and delay associated with conventional emergency glucagon kits. The authors highlight that, although this trial was conducted under controlled inpatient conditions, the combination of ready-to-use formulation and rapid glucose recovery suggests that dasiglucagon has the potential to improve real-world management of severe hypoglycemia and reduce the need for emergency medical care."
