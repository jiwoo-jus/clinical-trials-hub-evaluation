      "briefSummary": "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (CLIMB) evaluated whether twice-daily 0.12% chlorhexidine oral rinses for 8 weeks can alter the oral and lung microbiota and improve respiratory outcomes in adults with symptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Participants aged 40–85 years with COPD and chronic productive cough or recent COPD exacerbation were assigned to chlorhexidine or placebo mouth rinse. The main hypothesis was that chlorhexidine would reduce microbiota biomass in the mouth and lungs and thereby improve COPD-related symptoms and health-related quality of life. The primary outcome was change in oral and sputum microbiota biomass (by 16S rRNA quantification); secondary outcomes included microbial diversity and taxonomy, systemic inflammatory markers, daily symptom scores, and St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) scores.",
      "detailedDescription": "The ChLorhexidine effect In the oral and lung MicroBiota (CLIMB) study is a single-centre, randomized, blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group preliminary clinical trial conducted at a tertiary-care Veterans Affairs medical centre in the USA. The trial investigated the impact of altering the oral microbiome using chlorhexidine mouth rinses on oral and lung microbiota and clinical outcomes in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nEligible participants were 40–85 years old with a confirmed diagnosis of COPD and either chronic productive cough or at least one COPD exacerbation in the preceding year. Key exclusion criteria included antibiotics within the previous 2 months, less than four teeth, and not being at least 30 days recovered from a COPD exacerbation. Forty-four participants were randomized 1:1 via a random number generator to receive either 15 mL of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse (PerioGard) or a matched placebo mouth rinse, used twice daily for 8 weeks. The pharmacist handled allocation and was the only unblinded staff member.\n\nAt baseline (visit 1), participants underwent medical history, spirometry, and completion of the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). They were instructed to complete daily diaries using the Breathlessness, Cough and Sputum Scale (BCSS). Blood, oral rinse, and induced sputum samples were collected prior to randomization. After 8 weeks of treatment, participants returned study diaries, repeated the SGRQ, and provided follow-up blood, oral, and sputum samples.\n\nThe primary outcome was the change in oral and sputum microbiota biomass from baseline to 8 weeks, comparing chlorhexidine versus placebo, measured by 16S rRNA copy number with normalization to sample mass. Although the primary endpoint was biomass, power calculations were based on expected changes in alpha diversity (a secondary outcome) due to available data at study initiation. Secondary outcomes included: (1) oral and sputum microbiota alpha diversity (Shannon and Simpson indices) and taxonomic composition; (2) systemic inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, white blood cell count); (3) daily respiratory symptoms assessed by BCSS; (4) health-related quality of life assessed by SGRQ; and (5) safety and adverse events. Subgroup analyses excluded participants who received systemic antibiotics during the study.\n\nMicrobiological assessments used frozen oral rinse and sputum samples for DNA extraction, quantitative 16S rRNA PCR, and 16S rRNA V4 region sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Because the methods measure total bacterial DNA, they cannot distinguish between live and dead bacteria. Statistical analyses included two-sample t tests for log10-transformed biomass changes, linear regression for changes in diversity indices and clinical outcomes (adjusting for baseline values), multiple imputation for missing sputum weights, and correction for multiple testing via the step-down Bonferroni method. Analyses were conducted according to a modified intention-to-treat principle.\n\nForty participants (20 per group) completed the 8-week trial; all four withdrawals were in the chlorhexidine arm. Participants were predominantly male and Caucasian, with severe airflow limitation (mean FEV1 % predicted ~42%) and an average of about two COPD exacerbations in the prior year. Baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between treatment groups.\n\nChlorhexidine did not significantly reduce oral or sputum microbiota biomass relative to placebo. Both groups had modest decreases in biomass over time, and between-group differences in log10 change were not statistically significant. In sputum, some analyses even suggested a non-significant trend toward higher biomass in the chlorhexidine group, though this was contrary to the a priori hypothesis and interpreted cautiously.\n\nIn contrast, chlorhexidine use was associated with a significant decrease in alpha diversity in both oral and sputum microbiota. Regression analyses adjusted for baseline values showed that chlorhexidine significantly reduced Shannon and Simpson diversity indices compared with placebo for both sample types, findings that persisted in participants who did not receive antibiotics during the study. Exploratory taxonomic analyses revealed chlorhexidine-associated reductions in Corynebacterium abundance in sputum and Lachnoanaerobaculum in oral samples, but no broad genus-level shifts were detected, likely reflecting the method’s inability to distinguish live from dead microbes.\n\nClinically, chlorhexidine did not significantly improve daily BCSS symptom scores or systemic inflammatory markers (CRP, fibrinogen, white blood cell count) relative to placebo over the 8-week period. However, chlorhexidine users experienced a statistically and clinically meaningful improvement in respiratory health-related quality of life as reflected by a greater decrease in SGRQ total score (approximately −4.7 points vs +1.7 points with placebo, between-group difference about −6.2 points). No single SGRQ domain (symptoms, activity, impacts) fully explained this effect, suggesting a broad quality-of-life benefit. Adverse events were few and consistent with the known mild tolerability profile of chlorhexidine oral rinses (for example, mild oral discomfort, transient taste changes, tooth discoloration).\n\nThe study concludes that while twice-daily chlorhexidine oral rinses did not significantly lower microbiota biomass in the mouth or lungs as measured by total bacterial DNA, they did reduce microbiota alpha diversity in both sites and improved COPD-related quality of life. The authors propose that chlorhexidine may reduce the burden or alter the composition of viable oral bacteria, thereby modifying the lung microbiota and local inflammation through microaspiration, effects not fully captured by total DNA-based biomass measures. The trial’s limitations include its small sample size, single-centre design, predominantly male and racially homogeneous population, use of DNA-based methods that cannot differentiate live from dead bacteria, incomplete sputum weight data, and short follow-up. The findings support further, larger-scale trials to clarify the mechanisms linking oral antiseptic use, microbial ecology, and clinical outcomes in COPD, and to determine whether the observed quality-of-life benefits are durable and clinically generalizable."
