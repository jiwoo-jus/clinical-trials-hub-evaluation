      "briefSummary": "This feasibility randomized controlled trial tested a sensor-controlled digital game (SCDG) called Heart Health Mountain to support self-management in older adults with heart failure. Adults aged 55 and older with heart failure received Bluetooth-enabled weight scales and activity trackers for 12 weeks and were randomized to either use these sensors alone (control) or sensors plus the SCDG app (intervention). The game used real-time sensor data to trigger in‑game rewards, feedback, and tailored messages to motivate daily weight monitoring and physical activity. The study evaluated feasibility (recruitment, retention, engagement, satisfaction) and preliminary effects on adherence to daily weighing and physical activity, as well as heart failure knowledge, functional status, quality of life, self-care behaviors, self-efficacy, motivation, and heart failure–related hospitalizations over 24 weeks.",
      "detailedDescription": "This prospective feasibility randomized controlled trial (1:1 allocation) evaluated an innovative sensor-controlled digital game (SCDG) intervention, Heart Health Mountain, designed to improve heart failure (HF) self-management behaviors among older adults. The trial compared two parallel groups: (1) a sensors-only control group that received an activity tracker, a Bluetooth-enabled smart weighing scale, and the Withings Health Mate app to track daily weight and physical activity; and (2) an intervention group that received the same sensors plus access to the Heart Health Mountain SCDG app.\n\nEligible participants were English-speaking adults aged 55 years or older with a diagnosis of HF (New York Heart Association class II or III), who owned a smartphone, could ambulate independently, and had adequate cognition (Mini-Cog score ≥4). Exclusion criteria included severe visual or tactile impairment precluding smartphone use, end-stage renal failure, terminal illness, or lack of confirmed HF diagnosis. Participants were recruited from cardiac rehabilitation and inpatient cardiac units in Texas and, later, also via web-based recruitment in Texas and Oklahoma. The study period spanned November 2019 to January 2021, with adaptation to remote procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Heart Health Mountain SCDG, delivered on a smartphone, is grounded in the Fogg behavioral model, targeting motivation, ability, and triggers for behavior change. In the game, the player helps an avatar climb a mountain while aiming to avoid hospitalization. Real-time data from the Bluetooth scale and activity tracker are synchronized with the game so that actual daily behaviors—weight monitoring and step-based physical activity—drive game progress, rewards (eg, coins to purchase low-salt foods or avatar accessories), competition elements (eg, leaderboards), and tailored feedback (eg, advice in response to weight gain). Step goals are individualized, ranging from 3000 to 15,000 steps per day. Heart failure educational content derived from the \"Living Well With Heart Failure\" booklet is embedded in the game in small, low-literacy segments, with quizzes and problem-solving scenarios to reinforce knowledge and skills.\n\nBoth groups received standardized HF education; in the intervention group it was integrated into the game, while the control group received equivalent written materials. Sensor and game data were transmitted via the Health Mate app and the SCDG platform to a secure Google Cloud console. During the first week, a nursing research assistant remotely monitored data flow for troubleshooting. Training and installation were initially conducted in person and then transitioned to contactless device delivery and remote (phone/video) support during the pandemic.\n\nFeasibility outcomes included:\n- Recruitment: proportion of approached HF patients who enrolled.\n- Retention: proportion completing 12-week objective behavior tracking and 24-week follow-up surveys.\n- Engagement: proportion of intervention participants who used the SCDG on at least 50% of days over 12 weeks, and number of days with game use.\n- Satisfaction: ratings using the interest/enjoyment subscale of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory and qualitative feedback about likes, dislikes, and perceived motivational elements.\n\nHealth and behavior outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 weeks. Objective primary behavior outcomes were:\n- Daily weight monitoring: number of days with recorded weight from the Bluetooth scale (dichotomous per day: yes/no).\n- Physical activity: daily step counts from the activity tracker, averaged over 6 and 12 weeks.\n\nAdditional self-reported measures included:\n- HF-related functional status and quality of life using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) functional status (items 1–12) and quality-of-life (items 13–15) domains (0–100 scales, higher scores better).\n- HF knowledge using the 30-item Atlanta Heart Failure Knowledge Test.\n- HF self-care behaviors using the 9-item European Heart Failure Self-care Behavior Scale (standardized 0–100 score, higher better).\n- HF self-efficacy using the 6-item self-efficacy section of the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (0–100 scale).\n- Motivation for HF self-management behaviors using an HF-adapted 19-item Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire, computing a Relative Autonomy Index from autonomous and controlled regulation subscales.\n- HF-related hospitalizations via self-report with verification by discharge summaries or provider communication.\n- Depressive symptoms using the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire at all time points.\n\nRandomization used block sizes of 2 and 4, stratified by sex, with concealed allocation generated independently. The intervention and assessment staff were separated, and analysts were blinded to group assignment. Analyses were primarily descriptive, appropriate for feasibility work. Within-group changes were assessed with paired t tests, and effect sizes (Cohen d) were estimated for primary outcomes. Missing data were handled according to intent-to-treat principles using maximum likelihood estimation.\n\nThirty-eight participants were enrolled (19 per group). About half were women, half were ≥65 years, most were White, and over half had been hospitalized for HF in the prior 6 months. Retention was high: 32 of 38 participants provided 12-week objective behavior data, and 27 of 38 completed 24-week follow-up surveys. Among the intervention group, 15 of 19 successfully installed the SCDG app; of these, 11 used the game on more than 50% of days over 12 weeks. Game use days correlated strongly with days of weight monitoring (r≈0.72) and days with activity data (r≈0.90), suggesting that engagement with the SCDG was closely linked to engagement in HF self-management behaviors.\n\nTrends favored the SCDG group for behavior adherence. Compared with baseline self-report, a larger proportion of intervention participants achieved the clinically meaningful goal of weighing at least 5 days per week at 12 weeks, whereas the control group showed a slight decline. The effect size for mean days of weight monitoring at 12 weeks (intervention vs control) was in the medium range. Physical activity steps showed modest increases in the intervention group and modest declines in the control group from week 6 to week 12, though absolute step counts remained below general cardiovascular recommendations, which may reflect age, HF severity, and comorbid frailty.\n\nEngagement in dual behaviors (days with both a weight measurement and activity data) was more tightly coupled in the intervention group than in the control group, suggesting that the game may help integrate multiple HF self-care behaviors into daily routines. Subgroup trends indicated that women tended to weigh less frequently than men overall, but both sexes demonstrated better adherence in the intervention group than in the control group.\n\nBoth groups exhibited within-group improvements in HF functional status and quality of life (KCCQ scores) that were clinically and statistically significant and persisted through 24 weeks. HF knowledge improved modestly but significantly in both groups and was maintained at follow-up. Self-efficacy for HF self-care improved in both arms, with slightly greater trends in the control group, possibly related to continued sensor use. Self-reported HF self-care behaviors improved more consistently and durably in the intervention group than in the control group. Motivation (autonomous regulation) showed minimal change, possibly because participation itself implied an element of external accountability.\n\nHF hospitalization rates declined in both groups at 1 and 6 months; however, interpretations are limited by concurrent global reductions in cardiovascular hospitalizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Technical limitations included outdated activity trackers and sync issues for some participants, as well as challenges in real-time monitoring of unsafe weight changes due to high message volume with the alert system.\n\nOverall, this feasibility trial showed that an SCDG integrating real-time sensor data is acceptable and usable for older adults with HF and can be implemented both in person and remotely. Recruitment, retention, and engagement benchmarks were met or exceeded, and participant feedback highlighted the game’s motivational and educational value, while also identifying desires for more sophisticated game features and individualized step goals. The findings support conducting a larger, fully powered efficacy trial to rigorously test the impact of sensor-controlled digital gaming on HF self-management behaviors, functional outcomes, quality of life, and HF-related health care utilization."
