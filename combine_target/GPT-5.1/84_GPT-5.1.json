      "briefSummary": "This phase II, double-blind, multicenter, randomized clinical trial evaluated a new once-daily triple-combination topical gel (clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/benzoyl peroxide 3.1%/adapalene 0.15%, IDP-126) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne in patients aged 9 years and older. The study compared IDP-126 with its three component dyad gels (clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide/adapalene, clindamycin/adapalene) and with vehicle gel over 12 weeks of treatment. The hypothesis was that combining an antibiotic, an antibacterial agent, and a retinoid in a single fixed-dose formulation would provide superior efficacy and acceptable tolerability, potentially improving adherence and reducing antibiotic resistance compared with dyad or vehicle treatments.",
      "detailedDescription": "This was a phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled study conducted at 35 centers in the USA and Canada. Participants were 9 years of age or older with moderate (Evaluator’s Global Severity Score [EGSS] 3) or severe (EGSS 4) facial acne. Key inclusion criteria required 30–100 inflammatory lesions (pustules, papules, nodules), 35–150 noninflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones), and no more than two nodules on the face at baseline. The pathophysiologic rationale was to target multiple mechanisms in acne—Cutibacterium acnes proliferation, abnormal keratinization, sebum-related inflammation—by combining an antibiotic (clindamycin), an antibacterial/keratolytic agent (benzoyl peroxide), and a topical retinoid (adapalene) in a single aqueous gel.\n\nA total of 741 participants were randomized in equal proportions to five arms: (1) triple-combination clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/benzoyl peroxide 3.1%/adapalene 0.15% gel (IDP-126); (2) benzoyl peroxide 3.1%/adapalene 0.15% gel; (3) clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/benzoyl peroxide 3.1% gel; (4) clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/adapalene 0.15% gel; or (5) vehicle gel. All active formulations used the same polymeric, alcohol-free, preservative-free aqueous gel vehicle, with micronized benzoyl peroxide and adapalene for enhanced follicular penetration and potentially improved tolerability. Study medication was applied once daily to the entire face for 12 weeks. Standard cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen (CeraVe products) were provided to standardize skin care.\n\nCoprimary efficacy endpoints were: (1) treatment success at week 12, defined as a ≥2-grade reduction from baseline in EGSS plus an EGSS of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear); and (2) least-squares mean absolute changes from baseline to week 12 in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts. Secondary and post hoc endpoints included treatment success and ≥2-grade EGSS reduction at interim visits (weeks 2, 4, 8, 12), percent changes in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts over time, and changes in acne-related health-related quality of life assessed by the Acne-Specific Quality of Life (Acne-QoL) questionnaire (domains: self-perception, role-emotional, role-social, acne symptoms).\n\nSafety and tolerability assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and investigator- and patient-rated cutaneous signs and symptoms (scaling, erythema, hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, itching, burning, stinging) graded on a 0–3 scale (none to severe). Treatment compliance was defined as missing no more than 5 consecutive doses and using 80–120% of expected applications.\n\nEfficacy analyses used the intent-to-treat population (all randomized participants who received study drug). Treatment success at week 12 was evaluated via logistic regression including treatment and analysis center as factors. Because of skewness in change-from-baseline lesion counts, data were rank-transformed and analyzed by analysis of covariance, with treatment and center as factors and baseline lesion counts as covariates. Missing efficacy data were handled using Markov Chain Monte Carlo multiple imputation. For some logistic models with convergence issues, Firth’s penalized likelihood was applied. Statistical significance was set at two-sided p ≤ 0.05.\n\nOf the 741 randomized participants, 740 formed the intent-to-treat set and 725 formed the safety set. Baseline characteristics were balanced: mean age was about 19.5 years, 61% were female, approximately 69% were White, and about 80–86% had moderate acne (EGSS 3). Mean baseline inflammatory lesion counts were around 38–40 and noninflammatory lesion counts about 48–52. Treatment compliance was ≥93% across groups.\n\nAt week 12, IDP-126 achieved treatment success in 52.5% of participants, significantly higher than all three dyad combinations (27.8–30.5%) and vehicle (8.1%; p ≤ 0.001 for all comparisons). Least-squares mean absolute reductions in inflammatory lesions with IDP-126 were −29.9, vs −26.7, −24.8, −26.8 for the dyads and −19.6 for vehicle; reductions in noninflammatory lesions were −35.5 with IDP-126, vs −29.9, −27.8, −30.0 for the dyads and −21.8 for vehicle (all comparisons to IDP-126 p < 0.05 or better). These changes corresponded to more than 70% mean reductions in both inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions by week 12 with IDP-126. Significant differences versus vehicle in lesion percent reduction were apparent as early as week 2 and maintained through week 12; superiority versus each dyad was generally evident by week 4 for several lesion-type and visit combinations.\n\nBy study end, 58.7% of IDP-126-treated participants achieved at least a 2-grade EGSS improvement, compared with 35.8–37.0% for the dyads and 12.5% for vehicle. Acne-QoL improvements at week 12 were numerically greatest with IDP-126 in all domains, particularly self-perception and role-emotional, indicating meaningful improvements in patient-reported outcomes.\n\nIn terms of safety, TEAEs were reported by 36.2% of participants in the IDP-126 group and 35.6% in the benzoyl peroxide/adapalene group, compared with 18.1% (clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide), 27.0% (clindamycin/adapalene), and 15.1% (vehicle). Most TEAEs were mild or moderate; severe events were infrequent. The most common treatment-related TEAEs were application-site pain and dryness. Four participants experienced SAEs (one in IDP-126, three in clindamycin/adapalene), none related to study treatment. Discontinuations due to TEAEs were relatively low overall, but highest in the benzoyl peroxide/adapalene group (5.5%), versus 2.8% for IDP-126, 0% for clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide, 2.0% for clindamycin/adapalene, and 1.4% for vehicle.\n\nCutaneous tolerability showed transient increases in signs and symptoms (e.g., scaling, burning, stinging) at weeks 2–4 in all active arms, with mean scores ≤0.6 (mild) at all visits. By week 12, fewer than 6% of participants in any group experienced severe ratings for any cutaneous parameter. In the IDP-126 group, there were no severe cases of scaling, erythema, or itching, and <5% reported severe hyperpigmentation, burning, or stinging. Overall, IDP-126 appeared slightly more tolerable than the benzoyl peroxide/adapalene dyad, which had higher rates of severe burning and stinging and more discontinuations due to TEAEs.\n\nThe study supports that a fixed-dose triple-combination of clindamycin, benzoyl peroxide, and adapalene can provide superior efficacy compared with their dyad combinations and vehicle, while maintaining acceptable tolerability and safety over 12 weeks in pediatric, adolescent, and adult patients with moderate-to-severe acne. By targeting multiple acne pathogenic pathways in a single, once-daily formulation, IDP-126 may improve treatment adherence and help mitigate the risk of antibiotic resistance by incorporating benzoyl peroxide with a topical antibiotic. Longer-term and broader-population studies are needed to further characterize sustained efficacy, safety, antibiotic resistance patterns, and real-world effectiveness."
