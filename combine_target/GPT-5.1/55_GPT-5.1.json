      "briefSummary": "This first‑in‑human, phase 1 randomized, double‑blind study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of GSK3358699, a mononuclear myeloid‑targeted bromodomain and extra‑terminal domain (BET) inhibitor, in healthy adult males. In Part A, participants received single ascending oral doses of 1–40 mg GSK3358699 or placebo in a crossover design to characterize systemic exposure, intracellular metabolite levels in monocytes, and ex vivo inhibition of lipopolysaccharide‑induced cytokines. Part C was a planned 14‑day repeat‑dose phase with 10 mg GSK3358699 or placebo once daily, but it was terminated early due to clinically significant cardiac adverse events, including atrial fibrillation and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Single doses were generally well tolerated and produced measurable concentrations of the active metabolite GSK3206944 in target cells, but no suitable repeat‑dose regimen could be identified.",
      "detailedDescription": "This phase 1, randomized, double‑blind (sponsor‑open), first‑in‑human clinical study (NCT03426995) investigated GSK3358699, an esterase‑sensitive motif‑containing bromodomain and extra‑terminal domain (BET) family inhibitor designed to preferentially target mononuclear‑myeloid lineage cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. GSK3358699 is hydrolyzed by human carboxylesterase‑1 (CES‑1) within these cells to form the pharmacologically active acid metabolite GSK3206944, which is retained intracellularly and, together with the parent compound, functions as a potent BET inhibitor. The development concept was to achieve targeted BET inhibition in myeloid cells to modulate inflammatory pathways while mitigating the dose‑limiting toxicities (thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal symptoms, QTc prolongation) seen with pan‑BET inhibitors.\n\nHealthy male volunteers (18–56 years, body weight ≥50 kg, BMI 18.5–35.0 kg/m²) without significant cardiovascular, metabolic, hepatic, renal, respiratory, or gastrointestinal disease and without clinically important ECG abnormalities were enrolled. The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability, including adverse events, clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, 12‑lead ECGs, and continuous cardiac telemetry. Secondary and exploratory objectives included characterization of the systemic pharmacokinetics of GSK3358699 and GSK3206944, quantification of GSK3206944 in isolated monocytes, and assessment of pharmacodynamic effects on ex vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‑stimulated cytokine production (MCP‑1, IL‑6, TNF‑α).\n\nPart A used a single ascending‑dose, two‑cohort interlocking crossover design in 23 participants. Each participant could receive up to two different single oral doses of GSK3358699 (1, 3, 10, 20, 30, or 40 mg) and one placebo dose, with at least a 28‑day washout between active treatments. Dose escalation decisions were made by a Dose Escalation Committee, with predefined pharmacokinetic and safety stopping criteria. An additional exploratory period in Part A evaluated a 25‑mg dose combined with in vivo LPS or GM‑CSF challenge and cantharidin‑induced blisters; those immunologic challenge data are reported separately. Plasma pharmacokinetics were characterized up to 48 hours post‑dose. Monocyte intracellular GSK3206944 concentrations were measured using CD14‑positive cell isolation. Ex vivo pharmacodynamic activity was assessed by incubating whole blood in TruCulture LPS tubes and quantifying MCP‑1, IL‑6, and TNF‑α.\n\nIn Part A, exposure to GSK3358699 and GSK3206944 generally increased with dose. Cmax increased approximately dose‑proportionally, while AUC parameters increased more than dose‑proportionally across 1–40 mg. Plasma GSK3358699 was typically quantifiable up to 12 hours after doses ≤20 mg and up to 24 hours after doses ≥25 mg; GSK3206944 was quantifiable up to 24–48 hours at higher doses. Median initial half‑lives were about 0.7–1.1 hours for GSK3358699 and 2.1–2.9 hours for GSK3206944, with apparent terminal half‑lives of approximately 5–7 hours at doses ≥25 mg. Intracellular GSK3206944 in monocytes was quantifiable at 1 hour after 10 mg and at 1 and 4 hours after 20–40 mg, but not beyond 8 hours, confirming target‑cell delivery while showing relatively short intracellular persistence.\n\nEx vivo LPS‑stimulated pharmacodynamic data in Part A showed dose‑dependent inhibition of MCP‑1 at 1 hour post‑dose, with mean predicted inhibition reaching about 75% at 40 mg. However, inhibition was not sustained at 4 hours and there was no consistent inhibition of IL‑6 or TNF‑α. High inter‑ and intra‑participant variability in cytokine responses limited interpretability. Null control tubes showed minimal cytokine levels, indicating variability was not due to pre‑existing activation or assay contamination.\n\nPart C was designed as a repeat‑dose portion in healthy males, initially planned as four sequential cohorts with once‑daily oral GSK3358699 or placebo for 14 days. The starting dose was 10 mg QD, selected from Part A data as a conservative initial regimen unlikely to produce high levels of target engagement. Participants were to undergo ex vivo pharmacodynamic assessments and, in later cohorts, in vivo LPS or GM‑CSF challenges similar to Part A. Following cardiac safety concerns during the first repeat‑dose cohort (cohort 4), the design was amended to balance GSK3358699 and placebo 1:1, remove in vivo challenges from cohorts 5–7, and move these immunologic procedures to a planned cohort 8. The study was ultimately terminated during cohort 5, and cohorts 6–8 were not conducted.\n\nIn Part C, 25 participants (11 placebo, 14 GSK3358699) were randomized to 10 mg GSK3358699 or placebo QD for up to 14 days; only two participants per arm (sentinel subjects in cohorts 4 and 5) completed all 14 doses. Plasma pharmacokinetics after the first 10‑mg dose in Part C were consistent with single‑dose results from Part A. Limited day‑14 data precluded reliable estimation of accumulation. Intracellular monocyte GSK3206944 concentrations after 10 mg repeat dosing did not show clear enhancement compared with single dosing.\n\nAcross both parts, the most common adverse event was headache. Single doses up to 40 mg were generally well tolerated, with primarily mild to moderate adverse events and no serious adverse events in Part A. However, clinically significant cardiac events emerged across the study. In total, four episodes of asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) occurred in GSK3358699‑treated participants (two in Part A, two in Part C), and two episodes of atrial fibrillation (AF) occurred in Part C (one brief nonsustained AF in a placebo recipient and one sustained AF in a GSK3358699 recipient). The NSVT episodes led to a temporary halt of cohort 4 while an independent cardiology panel reviewed the data; these events were judged consistent with background NSVT incidence in healthy adults and not clearly drug‑related, allowing study restart. The sustained AF in the GSK3358699‑treated participant required hospitalization and electrical cardioversion, fulfilled protocol stopping rules, and led to permanent study termination. No subject exhibited clinically significant QTc prolongation, and routine safety labs and imaging showed no overt myocardial damage.\n\nIn parallel 3‑month GLP toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys, troponin elevations and cardiac histopathology were observed at exposures overlapping the clinical range, whereas 1‑month studies had not shown these findings. Considering these nonclinical data alongside the human AF and NSVT events, a causal relationship between GSK3358699 and cardiac toxicity could not be excluded. This substantially reduced the acceptable safety margin and effectively limited further clinical exploration to doses (≤5 mg) unlikely to achieve robust target engagement, especially given the variable and limited pharmacodynamic signal.\n\nOverall, the study demonstrated that GSK3358699 is orally bioavailable, delivers its active metabolite GSK3206944 into mononuclear myeloid cells, and at single doses up to 40 mg largely avoids the thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal toxicity, and QTc prolongation reported with pan‑BET inhibitors. Nevertheless, the totality of emerging cardiac safety signals in humans and animals, coupled with limited and variable pharmacodynamic effects in ex vivo cytokine assays, led to the conclusion that an acceptable therapeutic window could not be defined, and clinical development of GSK3358699 was discontinued."
