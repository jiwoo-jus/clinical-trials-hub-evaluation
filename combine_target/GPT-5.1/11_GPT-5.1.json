      "briefSummary": "This pragmatic, multicentre cluster-randomised controlled trial tests a multicomponent electronic health record–based clinical decision support (CDS) intervention to improve management of uncontrolled hypertension in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in primary care. Primary care clinicians at 15 practices are randomised at the clinician (or clinician dyad) level to receive either an active Epic Best Practice Advisory CDS or usual care. The intervention uses computable phenotypes to identify CKD patients with uncontrolled systolic blood pressure and then provides tailored treatment recommendations, including initiation or up-titration of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics, along with guideline links and explanations. Behavioural economic components include pre-commitment emails asking clinicians to pledge adherence to blood pressure management recommendations and accountable justification text fields when they disagree with CDS suggestions. The primary outcome is change in mean systolic blood pressure from baseline to 6 months. Secondary outcomes include hypertension- and CKD-related process measures, adverse drug events, and hypotension, evaluated using the RE-AIM implementation science framework.",
      "detailedDescription": "This study evaluates a multicomponent intervention designed to improve control of hypertension among adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in real-world primary care settings. The trial is conducted within the Brigham and Women’s Primary Care Practice-Based Research Network, which includes 15 diverse practices. The design is a pragmatic, cluster-randomised controlled trial, with randomisation at the clinician level (including solo primary care clinicians and co-management dyads) to minimise contamination and align with the clinician-focused nature of the intervention.\n\nEligible patients are adults (≥18 years) with CKD, defined by two prior estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values of 16–59 mL/min/1.73 m² or two urine albumin-to-creatinine ratios (UACR) >30 mg/g at least 90 days apart, who also have uncontrolled hypertension, defined as at least one systolic blood pressure (SBP) >140 mm Hg in the prior 2 years and SBP >140 mm Hg at the enrolment visit. Patients with very advanced kidney dysfunction (eGFR ≤20 most recent or two eGFRs ≤15 mL/min/1.73 m² separated by at least 90 days) are excluded. Patients are automatically enrolled at the time of qualifying primary care visits, with group assignment based on their clinician’s randomisation status.\n\nThe core of the intervention is a set of Epic Best Practice Advisories (BPAs) built on five computable phenotypes that identify CKD patients with uncontrolled SBP who would benefit from: (1) initiation of an ACE inhibitor (ACEi), (2) initiation of an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), (3) up-titration of a suboptimal ACEi dose, (4) up-titration of a suboptimal ARB dose, and (5) addition of a diuretic when ACEi or ARB therapy is maximised. When a qualifying patient’s chart is opened by an intervention clinician, the BPA displays patient-specific information explaining why it fired, structured treatment recommendations (for example, a suggested ACEi starting dose or ARB dose increase), and hyperlinks to relevant CKD and hypertension clinical guidelines.\n\nUser-centred design methods were used to develop and refine the CDS interface, including contextual inquiry of clinical workflows, group design sessions, and individual “think aloud” usability testing. These methods informed how data are displayed, how recommendations are framed, and how clinicians interact with the advisory. Behavioural economic principles are incorporated through default options, accountability, and public commitment: clinicians receive a pre-commitment email inviting them to pledge adherence to blood pressure treatment recommendations, and the BPA requires an ‘accountable justification’ if a clinician declines a recommendation, encouraging explicit documentation of the rationale. The CDS fires at the initial enrolment visit; follow-up firing occurs only if the clinician requests a reminder and if the patient still meets criteria (for example, persistent SBP >140/90 mm Hg and no newly documented contraindications or target medication use).\n\nImplementation was preceded by a silent-mode period and a short live pilot during which the CDS ran without being visible (for validation) and then was briefly activated to evaluate clinician interactions and uncover workflow issues and potential workarounds. Observed workarounds included selecting ‘other’ as a justification with non-informative text or initiating but not signing medication orders to dismiss the alert. These observations inform the assessment of real-world adoption and alert fatigue but did not lead to substantive modifications of the CDS logic for the main trial.\n\nOutcomes are evaluated within the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. The primary clinical endpoint is the change in mean SBP from baseline (prior year mean SBP) to 6 months, comparing intervention and control arms using generalised estimating equations that account for patient clustering within clinicians. Secondary outcomes include hypertension management process measures (for example, initiation or intensification of ACEi/ARB or diuretics, ordering of basic metabolic panels), CKD quality-of-care processes (for example, annual urine albumin testing), adverse drug events, and hypotension. Additional RE-AIM outcomes include reach (number and types of clinicians and patients exposed to the CDS), adoption (patterns of BPA acceptance, rejection, and justification), implementation (fidelity, barriers, workarounds, unintended consequences), and maintenance (sustainability of CDS use and integration into workflow over time).\n\nSample size calculations assumed an expected clinically meaningful 3 mm Hg greater reduction in SBP in the intervention arm compared with usual care, an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.1, and an average of six patients per clinician, yielding a requirement of approximately 497 evaluable patients per arm to achieve >80% power. Analyses will be primarily intent-to-intervene, with secondary analyses including multiple imputation for patients without follow-up visits, as-treated analyses based on actual clinician ordering behaviour, and clinician-level analyses. The trial received expedited ethical approval; patient-level informed consent was waived due to the pragmatic, clinician-level randomisation, and a Data Safety Monitoring Board oversees safety and potential harms such as hypotension and medication-related adverse events."
