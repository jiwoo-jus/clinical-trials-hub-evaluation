      "briefSummary": "This Phase 3 multicentre SPIRIT study evaluated the long‑term safety of fevipiprant, an oral selective prostaglandin D2 receptor 2 (DP2) antagonist, when added to standard asthma therapy in adolescents and adults with inadequately controlled moderate‑to‑severe asthma (GINA steps 3–5). Patients aged 12 years and older were randomized in a 3:3:1 ratio to receive fevipiprant 150 mg once daily, fevipiprant 450 mg once daily, or placebo, in addition to their existing asthma medications. The trial included two treatment periods: a 52‑week double‑blind phase followed by an optional 104‑week single‑blind extension, though the study was terminated early after negative efficacy results from other Phase 3 trials of fevipiprant. Both newly enrolled patients and those rolling over from prior Phase 3 fevipiprant efficacy trials (LUSTER-1, LUSTER-2, ZEAL-1, ZEAL-2) were included. Primary outcomes focused on treatment‑emergent adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation. Exploratory analyses assessed asthma exacerbation rates and lung function (FEV1). Fevipiprant showed a long‑term safety profile similar to placebo, with exploratory signals of reduced moderate‑to‑severe exacerbations and modest FEV1 improvement, although these efficacy findings were not powered or multiplicity‑adjusted and should be interpreted cautiously.",
      "detailedDescription": "SPIRIT (NCT03052517) was a Phase 3, randomised, placebo‑controlled, parallel‑group, multicentre study designed primarily to characterise the long‑term safety of fevipiprant, a highly selective, reversible antagonist of the prostaglandin D2 receptor 2 (DP2/CRTH2), in patients with uncontrolled asthma. The DP2 pathway is implicated in type 2 airway inflammation and mediates chemoattraction and activation of eosinophils, basophils, group 2 innate lymphoid cells, and Th2 lymphocytes via prostaglandin D2 and its metabolites.\n\nThe trial enrolled male and female patients aged ≥12 years with moderate‑to‑severe asthma treated according to Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) steps 3, 4, or 5. Two main cohorts were included: (1) rollover patients who had completed one of four Phase 3 fevipiprant efficacy trials (LUSTER‑1, LUSTER‑2 in severe asthma, and ZEAL‑1, ZEAL‑2 in moderate asthma) while still on blinded study therapy, and (2) newly recruited patients with inadequately controlled asthma (ACQ ≥1.5) on GINA step 4–5 treatment for at least 3 months and reduced lung function (percent predicted FEV1 ≤85% for adults, ≤90% for adolescents). Patients with recent severe exacerbations, recent respiratory tract infection, or asthma worsening prior to first visit were excluded. Rollover patients with serious or drug‑related AEs in their prior fevipiprant study were not eligible.\n\nSPIRIT consisted of two consecutive treatment periods: an initial 52‑week double‑blind period followed by an optional 104‑week single‑blind extension. Patients were randomised using stratified block randomisation in an approximate 3:3:1 ratio to receive fevipiprant 150 mg once daily, fevipiprant 450 mg once daily, or matching placebo, in addition to standard of care (SoC) asthma treatment. Rollover patients were re‑randomised and could receive a different treatment from their prior trial. Randomisation strata accounted for prior treatment and study (LUSTER or ZEAL) and for newly enrolled patients. An independent data monitoring committee oversaw patient safety.\n\nThe primary objective was to evaluate the long‑term safety and tolerability of fevipiprant 150 mg and 450 mg versus placebo. Key safety endpoints were time‑to‑first treatment‑emergent adverse event (AE), time‑to‑first treatment‑emergent serious adverse event (SAE), and time‑to‑first AE leading to discontinuation of study treatment. Treatment‑emergent AEs were defined as events starting on or after the first dose and up to the day after the last dose. A Cox regression model stratified by randomisation stratum, with treatment, asthma severity (GINA steps 3–5), and region as fixed factors, was used to estimate hazard ratios comparing fevipiprant doses with placebo. AEs were coded using MedDRA v22.1, and exposure‑adjusted incidence rates were calculated. Additional safety assessments included laboratory parameters, vital signs, ECGs, and adverse events of special interest (cardiac events, hepatotoxicity, idiosyncratic drug reactions, tachycardia).\n\nExploratory efficacy analyses focused on the rate of moderate‑to‑severe asthma exacerbations and change from baseline in pre‑dose FEV1. A severe exacerbation was defined as use of rescue systemic corticosteroids for ≥3 days with hospitalisation or prolonged emergency department stay (>24 h), or asthma‑related death. A moderate exacerbation was defined as rescue systemic corticosteroids for ≥3 days without prolonged hospital care. Due to negative lung function outcomes in ZEAL and the expectation of few exacerbations in moderate asthma, ZEAL rollover patients were excluded from the SPIRIT exploratory efficacy analyses; only LUSTER rollover and newly randomised patients were included. Exacerbation rates were analysed using negative binomial regression including treatment, randomisation stratum, asthma severity, region, prior 12‑month exacerbation history, and, for the overall population, blood eosinophil category (≥250 vs <250 cells/µL). Change in pre‑dose FEV1 was analysed using a mixed model for repeated measures with baseline FEV1, visit, and treatment‑by‑visit interactions, and the same covariates; an unstructured covariance matrix was used. Subgroup analyses were pre‑specified for patients with high blood eosinophil counts (≥250 cells/µL).\n\nThe study enrolled 2,538 patients (1,807 rollover and 731 new): 1,093 were randomised to fevipiprant 150 mg, 1,085 to fevipiprant 450 mg, and 360 to placebo. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were balanced across groups, with a mean age of about 50 years, mean asthma duration about 21 years, and 60% atopic. Most patients were never‑smokers, and mean pre‑bronchodilator percent predicted FEV1 was approximately 61%, with mean bronchodilator reversibility around 23%.\n\nSPIRIT was terminated early by the sponsor on 16 December 2019 after the wider fevipiprant Phase 3 programme failed to demonstrate sufficient efficacy. Consequently, data from the 52‑week double‑blind and optional 104‑week single‑blind periods were combined for analysis rather than analysed separately as initially planned. At termination, 1,184 patients had received at least 52 weeks of treatment, and 163 had at least 104 weeks of exposure.\n\nSafety analyses showed that both fevipiprant doses had a safety profile generally similar to placebo. Hazard ratios for time‑to‑first treatment‑emergent AE and SAE were <1 for both fevipiprant doses versus placebo, indicating no excess risk; however, hazard ratios for AEs leading to discontinuation were slightly >1, with small event numbers and wide confidence intervals. The most common AEs were asthma exacerbation, nasopharyngitis, and bronchitis, mostly mild or moderate. Exposure‑adjusted incidence rates of SAEs and discontinuations due to AEs were low and comparable across groups. Five treatment‑emergent deaths occurred (three in the 150 mg group, one in the 450 mg group, one in placebo), none judged related to study drug and none due to asthma exacerbation. There was no evidence of dose‑related safety signals or differential safety by age, sex, or prior study cohort. Adverse events of special interest occurred infrequently and without notable imbalances. Laboratory values, vital signs, and ECG findings were similar across treatment arms.\n\nExploratory efficacy results indicated lower annualized rates of moderate‑to‑severe asthma exacerbations and longer time‑to‑first exacerbation for both fevipiprant doses compared with placebo in the overall efficacy population and in the high eosinophil subgroup. Rate ratios versus placebo for exacerbations were approximately 0.55–0.58 overall and 0.61–0.64 in patients with eosinophils ≥250 cells/µL, with no clear difference between doses. These reductions were mainly driven by rollover patients from the LUSTER trials; newly enrolled patients did not show a consistent benefit. Fevipiprant also produced modest improvements in pre‑dose FEV1 at Week 52 versus placebo, more noticeable in the high eosinophil subgroup. Nonetheless, these efficacy analyses were post hoc or exploratory, performed without multiplicity adjustment, and the overall fevipiprant programme (notably LUSTER and ZEAL) did not confirm clinically meaningful efficacy.\n\nIn conclusion, SPIRIT demonstrates that long‑term administration of fevipiprant 150 mg or 450 mg once daily, added to standard asthma therapy, is generally well tolerated over up to 104 weeks in a large population of patients with uncontrolled moderate‑to‑severe asthma. While exploratory analyses suggested reductions in moderate‑to‑severe exacerbations and modest lung function improvements, the lack of confirmatory efficacy in the broader Phase 3 programme led to discontinuation of fevipiprant development. The long‑term safety data from SPIRIT are expected to inform future development of DP2 receptor antagonists for asthma.",
