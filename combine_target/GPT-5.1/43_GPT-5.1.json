      "briefSummary": "This double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, sham-controlled trial investigated whether repeated prism adaptation can improve gait and postural control in people with Parkinson’s disease. Adults with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease and clinically evident gait or balance problems completed two weeks of twice-daily home-based prism adaptation using goggles that shifted the visual field upward, or sham goggles with no shift. Posture and gait were assessed before and immediately after treatment using clinical balance and gait tests, computerized posturography, and self-report questionnaires, with additional questionnaire follow-up up to 3 months. The main hypothesis was that real prism adaptation would shift the body’s center of gravity forward, leading to better stepping performance, balance, and functional mobility compared with sham. The study found that although prism adaptation increased forward stepping velocity, it did not produce meaningful improvements in balance, gait, or daily functioning compared with sham treatment.",
      "detailedDescription": "This study evaluated the therapeutic potential of sensorimotor prism adaptation for gait disturbance and postural instability in Parkinson’s disease. Gait initiation and freezing in Parkinson’s disease have been linked to difficulty shifting the body’s center of gravity (COG) forward and downward over the feet. Prior proof-of-principle work showed that a single session of adaptation to upward-shifting prisms reduced forward stepping latencies in people with Parkinson’s disease, suggesting that repeated sessions might induce a forward COG shift and improve gait and balance.\n\nDesign and participants:\nThe trial used a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, sham-controlled design. Participants were adults (40–85 years) with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease recruited from a balance and vestibular clinic. Eligibility required at least one of: Hoehn and Yahr stage II.5–IV, a score > 0 on the gait, freezing of gait, or postural stability items of the MDS-UPDRS Part III, or a Timed Up and Go (TUG) time > 12 seconds. Exclusion criteria included other neurological or psychiatric conditions that could affect gait or balance, normal MDS-UPDRS Part III, right arm impairment preventing pointing, inadequate vision for the task, or insufficient English for consent. Thirty-one patients were enrolled; 18 were allocated to real prism adaptation (16 analyzed) and 13 to sham (all analyzed).\n\nIntervention:\nParticipants were randomized using a sealed-envelope style allocation to either real or sham adaptation. Real adaptation involved wearing goggles fitted with Fresnel lenses that induced a ~17° upward shift of the visual field; sham goggles produced no optical shift. In each session, participants sat facing a wall-mounted target sheet and made 50 rapid pointing movements with the right index finger to two vertically arranged targets while wearing the goggles, minimizing head movement. They were trained in-person and then performed the treatment at home twice daily for 14 days. Adherence and subjective attention, fatigue, and effort were recorded in logbooks. Participants, caregivers, and outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.\n\nOutcomes and assessments:\nPrimary outcomes were measures of postural control: (1) Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and (2) computerized posturography using the Smart EquiTest Balance Master system, including the Limits of Stability (LOS) test, Sensory Organization Test (SOT), and Motor Control Test (MCT). The LOS assessed reaction time, maximum COG movement velocity, and maximum excursion in forward and backward directions while leaning without stepping. The SOT evaluated postural stability and COG alignment under different combinations of visual and proprioceptive conditions, focusing on composite equilibrium scores and forward–backward COG alignment. The MCT measured automatic postural response latencies to platform translations.\n\nSecondary outcomes included clinical gait measures and self-report instruments. Clinical gait measures were the Timed Up and Go test, Functional Gait Assessment, and the Walk Across test from the EquiTest (step length and speed). Self-report measures included the New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire, Falls Efficacy Scale, Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, and the Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire-39 (overall, mobility, and activities of daily living subscales). Patient’s Global Impressions of Change ratings were collected post-treatment and at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months to capture subjective change in overall status, freezing, walking, and balance. Baseline neurologic assessment included MDS-UPDRS Part III, Hoehn and Yahr staging, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment.\n\nTesting schedule:\nIn-person assessments were conducted immediately before treatment (pre) and one day after the 2-week intervention (1d post). Questionnaires were also administered by mail at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after the end of treatment to examine persistence of any effects.\n\nResults:\nGroups were generally well matched at baseline on demographic, clinical, and questionnaire measures, and compliance with the prescribed number of sessions was similar between groups. Blinding appeared successful; participants’ guesses about their allocation did not differ significantly between groups, and no treatment-related harms were reported.\n\nOn the primary postural outcomes, there were no significant group differences or time × group interactions for the Berg Balance Scale, SOT composite scores or COG alignment, or MCT latencies. In the LOS test, both groups showed faster and larger forward versus backward leaning overall. A significant group × time × direction interaction emerged for maximum movement velocity: the real prism group showed a significant increase in forward stepping velocity after treatment, while the sham group did not show a similar change. However, there were no corresponding changes in backward stepping velocity or other LOS parameters that would suggest a broader functional improvement.\n\nSecondary outcomes showed no main effects or interactions for TUG, Functional Gait Assessment, Walk Across step length, or step speed. Across all follow-up periods, questionnaire scores (New Freezing of Gait, Falls Efficacy, Activities-specific Balance Confidence, and PDQ-39 total and subscales) did not show differential improvements between the real and sham groups. Patient’s Global Impressions of Change ratings stayed below levels indicating meaningful improvement in both groups, and paradoxically, the real treatment group, on average, reported less perceived improvement than the sham group.\n\nInterpretation:\nThe regimen of 2 weeks of twice-daily adaptation to upward-shifting prisms produced a measurable increase in forward stepping velocity but did not translate into improvements in global postural control, gait performance, or perceived daily function compared to sham. COG alignment at rest did not change, suggesting that any prism-induced changes in stepping dynamics were insufficient to shift the resting body configuration forward or to improve freezing or gait stability. The authors note potential limitations, including the lack of direct measurement of adaptation after-effects during the treatment period, unrecorded co-interventions such as ongoing physiotherapy, and the possibility that a different dose, larger prism strength, longer treatment duration, or alternative prism directions might yield different results. They also point out that adaptation to vertical visual shifts may differ fundamentally from adaptation to horizontal shifts that have shown benefit in stroke-related postural imbalance.\n\nThe study concludes that this specific protocol—2 weeks of twice-daily home-based adaptation to upward-shifting prisms—should not currently be recommended as a treatment for gait disturbance or postural instability in Parkinson’s disease, although the observation of increased forward stepping velocity suggests a possible avenue for further research with modified protocols."
