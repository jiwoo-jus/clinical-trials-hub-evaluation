      "briefSummary": "This randomized phase 2 clinical trial (NCCTG/Alliance N0879) evaluated whether the presence of circulating cell-free BRAFV600E/K DNA (cfDNA) in blood is associated with prognosis in patients with unresectable stage IV melanoma who were not receiving BRAF-targeted therapy. Patients were treated with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab with or without everolimus, while archived tumor tissue and pretreatment plasma were tested for BRAFV600E/K mutations. The study compared progression-free and overall survival between patients with and without detectable cfDNA BRAFV600E/K, and assessed the sensitivity and specificity of a digital droplet PCR assay against tumor tissue testing.",
      "detailedDescription": "North Central Cancer Treatment Group (now Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology) N0879 was a randomized phase 2 trial in patients with unresectable stage IV melanoma. The trial compared a chemotherapy regimen of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab with or without everolimus. Importantly, no BRAF-targeted therapies were used, allowing evaluation of circulating biomarkers without confounding from BRAF inhibitors.\n\nThe objective of this analysis was to determine the prognostic value of detectable circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) harboring BRAFV600E/K mutations in this population. BRAFV600 mutations are present in 40%–60% of advanced melanomas and are central to the RAF–MEK–ERK signaling pathway. Standard practice uses archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue to determine BRAF mutation status, but tissue may be unavailable, mutation status can evolve over time, and heterogeneity between primary and metastatic sites can occur. cfDNA released from dying tumor cells offers a minimally invasive alternative for mutation detection and disease monitoring.\n\nThe study included 149 patients with histologically confirmed unresectable stage IV melanoma enrolled between May 5, 2010 and May 2, 2014, with one or fewer prior chemotherapy regimens. Key exclusions were prior taxane-based chemotherapy, prior anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy, brain metastases before enrollment, and significant comorbidities or other malignancies.\n\nArchived tumor tissue was analyzed using a clinical 50-gene hotspot next-generation sequencing panel (Illumina MiSeq) to detect somatic BRAFV600 mutations (exons 11 and 15, codons 594, 596, 600). Pretreatment plasma samples, collected at enrollment and stored at –80 °C, were used for cfDNA extraction. A clinically validated digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) assay (RainDrop/Bio-Rad platform) with TaqMan probes specific for wild-type BRAF and BRAFV600E/K mutations was applied to detect cfDNA BRAFV600E/K, reported qualitatively as “detected” or “not detected.” Laboratory personnel were blinded to clinical data.\n\nOf the 149 enrolled patients, plasma samples were available for 134, and both tumor tissue and plasma for 63. Among these 63, 20 (31.7%) had tumor tissue–confirmed BRAF V600E/K mutations and 43 were BRAF wild type. Of the 20 with tumor BRAF mutations, 11 (55.0%) had detectable cfDNA BRAFV600E/K. One of 43 patients with BRAF wild-type tissue had detectable cfDNA BRAFV600E/K. Using tissue as the reference, the cfDNA assay had a sensitivity of 55%, specificity of 97.7%, positive predictive value of 91.7%, and negative predictive value of 82.4%.\n\nTime-to-event outcomes (progression-free survival [PFS] and overall survival [OS]) were analyzed using Kaplan–Meier estimates, pooling both treatment arms because the parent trial showed no difference between regimens. Among patients with BRAF-mutant tumors, those with detectable cfDNA BRAFV600E/K had shorter PFS (median 5.8 vs 12.0 months; P = .051) and OS (median 9.2 vs 27.1 months; P = .054) than those without detectable cfDNA mutation, suggesting that the presence of cfDNA BRAFV600E/K is associated with worse prognosis. Patients without detectable BRAF mutations in either tissue or blood had superior outcomes compared with patients with both tissue BRAF mutation and positive cfDNA. In multivariate analysis, elevated baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was strongly associated with shorter PFS and OS, and male sex with shorter OS, although the analysis was underpowered.\n\nThe study concludes that in advanced melanoma, approximately half of patients with BRAF-mutant tumors have detectable cfDNA BRAFV600E/K, and that detectable cfDNA BRAFV600E/K is associated with poorer survival outcomes in a setting without BRAF-targeted therapy. The cfDNA assay showed high specificity but modest sensitivity relative to tissue testing, reflecting the low fraction of tumor-derived DNA in circulation, especially in patients with low tumor burden. The findings support the use of cfDNA BRAFV600E/K as a minimally invasive prognostic biomarker and a potential tool for risk stratification and patient selection in future melanoma clinical trials. Further research in larger cohorts and in the context of modern targeted and immunotherapies is recommended to refine its prognostic, predictive, and diagnostic roles."
