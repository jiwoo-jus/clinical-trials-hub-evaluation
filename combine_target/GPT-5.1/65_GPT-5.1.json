      "briefSummary": "This phase 2a, multicenter, randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of RIST4721, an oral CXC chemokine receptor type 2 (CXCR2) antagonist, in adults with moderate to severe palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP). Adults aged 18–70 years with a history of PPP, a Palmoplantar Pustulosis Area and Severity Index (PPPASI) ≥ 8, Palmoplantar Pustulosis Physician Global Assessment (PPPGA) ≥ 3, and minimum fresh pustule counts were randomized 1:1 to receive RIST4721 300 mg or placebo once daily for 28 days. The primary goal was to determine whether RIST4721 reduces fresh and total pustule counts compared with placebo, reflecting a benefit in this neutrophil‑mediated inflammatory skin disease. Overall, RIST4721 was generally well tolerated but did not show superiority to placebo on the primary endpoints; exploratory and post hoc analyses in patients with progressing disease suggested a potential treatment effect.",
      "detailedDescription": "This exploratory phase 2a clinical study investigated RIST4721, a small‑molecule CXC chemokine receptor type 2 (CXCR2) antagonist, as a potential oral treatment for palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP), a rare, chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by sterile pustules on the palms and soles and associated symptoms such as erythema, scaling, pain, and pruritus. PPP is strongly associated with smoking and driven in part by neutrophilic infiltration of the epidermis, with interleukin‑8 (IL‑8) and other CXCR2 ligands implicated in neutrophil recruitment and activation.\n\nThe trial (RIST4721‑201; NCT03988335) was a multicenter, randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled study conducted at sites in Canada and Germany. Adults 18–70 years of age with at least a 6‑month history of PPP, moderate to severe disease (Palmoplantar Pustulosis Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PPPASI] ≥ 8 and Palmoplantar Pustulosis Physician Global Assessment [PPPGA] ≥ 3), and predefined minimum numbers of fresh pustules (≥ 8 at screening and ≥ 20 at baseline) were eligible. Fresh pustules were defined as macroscopically visible white/yellow pustules without brown coloration, with or without crust, on the glabrous skin of palms and/or soles.\n\nEligible participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either RIST4721 300 mg oral solution or matching placebo once daily for 28 days, following an up to 30‑day screening period and a 14‑day post‑treatment follow‑up. The 300‑mg dose and once‑daily regimen were selected based on phase 1 pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data indicating dose‑dependent, reversible reductions in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) without causing moderate or severe neutropenia. Randomization was stratified by consent to skin biopsy collection.\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoints were the relative change from baseline to day 28 in fresh pustule count and total pustule count. Secondary endpoints included absolute change from baseline in fresh and total pustule counts at day 28, and the proportion of subjects achieving at least a 50% reduction in fresh and total pustule counts. Exploratory endpoints included the proportion of subjects achieving at least a 50% reduction in PPPASI (PPPASI‑50) and Palmoplantar Pustulosis Severity Index (PPSI) scores over time, changes in PPPGA, pain visual analogue scale (VAS), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and plasma concentrations of RIST4721.\n\nEfficacy analyses were conducted in the modified intent‑to‑treat population (all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study drug), using mixed‑model repeated measures for continuous outcomes and Fisher’s exact test for dichotomous response endpoints. Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations, vital signs, and electrocardiograms. Particular attention was paid to changes in ANC as an on‑target pharmacodynamic marker of CXCR2 blockade.\n\nA total of 35 subjects were randomized, and 34 received study treatment (15 RIST4721, 19 placebo). The majority were female and current smokers, consistent with known PPP epidemiology. Baseline mean fresh and total pustule counts and PPPASI/PPPGA scores indicated moderate to severe disease in both arms.\n\nTreatment with RIST4721 was generally well tolerated. A higher proportion of RIST4721‑treated subjects experienced treatment‑emergent AEs compared with placebo, most of which were mild gastrointestinal or musculoskeletal disorders and resolved without leading to treatment discontinuation. Two subjects in the RIST4721 group developed mild, transient, asymptomatic neutropenia; ANCs remained above 1.0 × 10^9/L and normalized by day 42. Mean ANC decreased in the RIST4721 arm but remained within the reference range, with no corresponding change in the placebo group, consistent with the expected pharmacologic effect of CXCR2 antagonism. No serious AEs or deaths occurred.\n\nFor the primary efficacy endpoints, no statistically significant differences were observed between RIST4721 and placebo at day 28. Mean relative changes from baseline in fresh pustule count were 0.86 (SD 0.692) for RIST4721 and 0.53 (SD 0.561) for placebo (P = 0.240), and in total pustule count were 0.99 (SD 0.667) and 0.96 (SD 0.672), respectively (P = 0.804). Secondary analyses similarly showed no significant advantage of RIST4721 over placebo; for example, the absolute reduction in fresh pustule count from baseline to day 28 was numerically smaller with RIST4721 (−2.1 ± 19.68) than with placebo (−18.3 ± 24.05; P = 0.053), and the proportion of patients achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in fresh pustule count at day 28 did not differ significantly between groups.\n\nPPPASI, PPSI, PPPGA, pain VAS, and DLQI scores improved over 28 days in both treatment arms, reflecting overall clinical benefit and placebo response, but without statistically significant differences between RIST4721 and placebo in the intent‑to‑treat population. A numerically higher proportion of RIST4721‑treated subjects achieved PPPASI‑50 at day 28 compared with placebo (40% vs 26.3%), but this difference did not reach statistical significance.\n\nGiven the fluctuating nature of PPP and the observation that some subjects improved between screening and baseline, a post hoc subgroup analysis was performed in patients with progressing disease, defined as an increase in total pustule count from screening to baseline. In this subgroup, the proportion of subjects achieving PPPASI‑50 at day 28 was significantly higher with RIST4721 (71%) than with placebo (15%) (P = 0.022), and improvement in pustule count on a target palm or sole was significantly greater with RIST4721. These findings suggest that RIST4721 may be more effective in patients experiencing active disease flares, potentially by blocking neutrophil migration to inflamed skin.\n\nThe study had several limitations, including a small sample size, short 28‑day treatment duration, and substantial inter‑ and intra‑subject variability in pustule counts. Counting fresh pustules proved challenging and may have introduced measurement variability and limited the power to detect differences. Future studies are suggested to include longer treatment periods, more homogeneous patient selection (possibly aided by central image review), and alternative or additional endpoints such as PPPASI and PPPGA to better capture disease activity and treatment response.\n\nIn conclusion, once‑daily RIST4721 300 mg oral solution for 28 days was generally well tolerated in adults with moderate to severe PPP and produced expected, reversible reductions in neutrophil counts. Although the primary efficacy endpoints were not met in the overall study population, exploratory and post hoc analyses in patients with progressing disease provide preliminary evidence that RIST4721 may have clinical benefit in PPP, warranting further evaluation in larger and longer‑term clinical trials."
