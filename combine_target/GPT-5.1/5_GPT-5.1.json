      "briefSummary": "This phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial evaluated the safety, tolerability, and immune response to V114, a 15‑valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, compared with the 13‑valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in pneumococcal vaccine‑naive, immunocompetent adults aged 18–49 years, with or without medical or behavioral risk factors for pneumococcal disease. Participants were randomized 3:1 to receive a single dose of either V114 or PCV13, followed 6 months later by a single dose of the 23‑valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). The study assessed adverse events and serious adverse events after each vaccination, and measured functional antibody responses (opsonophagocytic activity) and IgG concentrations to pneumococcal serotypes included in V114, PCV13, and PPSV23. The main objective was to determine whether V114, alone and when followed by PPSV23, is well tolerated and elicits robust immune responses, including to serotypes 22F and 33F that are not contained in PCV13, in at‑risk and not‑at‑risk adults.",
      "detailedDescription": "This phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double‑blind, active comparator–controlled study (protocol V114‑017; NCT03547167; EudraCT 2017‑004915‑38) investigated the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V114, a 15‑valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, in immunocompetent adults aged 18–49 years who were pneumococcal vaccine‑naive. Participants could have predefined medical or behavioral risk factors for pneumococcal disease (PD), such as chronic heart, liver, or lung disease, diabetes mellitus, current tobacco use, and higher alcohol consumption; adults without risk factors were enrolled at specific American Indian health sites.\n\nApproximately 1500 participants were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive a single intramuscular dose of V114 or PCV13 on Day 1, followed 6 months later by an open‑label dose of PPSV23. V114 contains 13 serotypes shared with PCV13 (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23F) plus 2 additional serotypes, 22F and 33F, which have become important causes of invasive pneumococcal disease following widespread use of earlier conjugate vaccines. PPSV23 contains 23 pneumococcal polysaccharide serotypes, including all 15 V114 serotypes and additional serotypes not included in conjugate vaccines.\n\nThe trial was designed as a descriptive immunogenicity and safety study and was not powered to demonstrate formal statistical differences between V114 and PCV13. Randomization was stratified by site (American Indian health sites vs non‑American Indian sites), by type and number of predefined PD risk factors, and by higher alcohol use defined by an AUDIT‑C score ≥5.\n\nSafety assessments included solicited injection‑site and systemic adverse events (AEs) recorded by participants on Vaccination Report Cards after each dose, as well as non‑solicited AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), and deaths from consent through study end. Injection‑site AEs were collected for days 1–5 and systemic AEs for days 1–14 after each vaccination. Severity was graded according to FDA toxicity criteria for preventive vaccine trials. All injection‑site AEs were considered related to vaccine; investigators assessed causality for systemic AEs.\n\nImmunogenicity was assessed in a per‑protocol population using blood samples at Day 1 (prevaccination with PCV), Day 30 (30 days after V114 or PCV13), Month 6 (prevaccination with PPSV23), and Month 7 (30 days after PPSV23). Functional antibody responses were measured as serotype‑specific opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) geometric mean titers (GMTs) using a validated multiplexed microcolony assay, and serotype‑specific IgG geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) were measured by a validated multiplex electrochemiluminescence assay. Primary immunogenicity endpoints were Day 30 OPA GMTs for all 15 serotypes in V114 within each vaccine group. Secondary endpoints included IgG GMCs at Day 30, OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs at Months 6 and 7, geometric mean fold rises, and proportions of participants with ≥4‑fold rises in OPA or IgG from pre‑ to post‑vaccination timepoints. Exploratory analyses compared V114 and PCV13 responses via constrained longitudinal data analysis models.\n\nMost participants experienced at least one solicited AE after V114 or PCV13 and after PPSV23, primarily mild and transient injection‑site pain and fatigue. The proportions and patterns of AEs, including SAEs, were similar between V114 and PCV13 recipients, and between groups after PPSV23. No vaccine‑related deaths and no vaccine‑related discontinuations were reported.\n\nImmunologically, both V114 and PCV13 induced robust OPA and IgG responses 30 days after vaccination for all serotypes contained in each product. For the 13 shared serotypes, OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs were generally comparable between groups. As expected, V114 elicited strong responses to serotypes 22F and 33F, which are unique to V114 and epidemiologically important causes of invasive disease; responses to these serotypes were substantially higher in the V114 group than in the PCV13 group. Antibody levels declined between Day 30 and Month 6 but remained above baseline. After PPSV23 administration at Month 6, OPA and IgG responses increased again for all 15 serotypes in both prior‑PCV groups and were generally comparable between those primed with V114 vs PCV13, including for 22F and 33F. For some shared serotypes, post‑PPSV23 titers did not exceed the peak levels achieved after the initial conjugate vaccine dose, consistent with prior observations that PPSV23 does not always boost responses beyond high pre‑existing antibody levels.\n\nOverall, the study demonstrates that in immunocompetent, pneumococcal vaccine‑naive adults 18–49 years of age, including those with common medical and behavioral risk factors for PD and in Native American populations, V114 is well tolerated and immunogenic for all 15 vaccine serotypes. When followed 6 months later by PPSV23, safety remains acceptable and broad serotype‑specific immune responses are maintained or enhanced, supporting V114 as a strategy to extend serotype coverage beyond PCV13, particularly through inclusion of serotypes 22F and 33F."
