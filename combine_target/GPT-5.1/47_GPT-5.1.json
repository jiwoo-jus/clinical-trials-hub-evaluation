      "briefSummary": "This pilot, double-blind, randomized controlled trial will evaluate a parent-coaching intervention called Occupational Performance Coaching (OPC) for families of young children with developmental disabilities in Hong Kong. About 50 parent–child pairs, with children aged 2–6 years who have a clinically diagnosed developmental disability, will be randomly assigned to receive either OPC or a comparison intervention of structured parent consultation, while continuing any usual care such as early intervention or therapy. OPC is grounded in self-determination theory and aims to improve children’s participation in community activities by coaching parents to set goals, problem-solve, and implement strategies in everyday contexts. Outcomes will be measured at four time points from baseline to 8–9 weeks after the intervention, focusing primarily on child community participation and goal performance, and secondarily on parenting competence, parent emotional health, child quality of life, and child functional performance. The study will determine the feasibility (recruitment, retention, adherence, fidelity, blinding), acceptability (parent and coach interviews), and initial efficacy of OPC to inform a future full-scale efficacy trial.",
      "detailedDescription": "This study is a Phase 1 feasibility and pilot randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate Occupational Performance Coaching (OPC) for parents of young children with developmental disabilities (DD) in Hong Kong. High rates of restricted community participation are reported among young children with DD, and existing early intervention services in Hong Kong primarily target children’s skills (e.g., motor, self-care) rather than their participation in community life. OPC is a family-centered, enablement-focused coaching model grounded in self-determination theory that seeks to enhance children’s participation in everyday life by working through parents as agents of change.\n\nThe trial will use a two-arm, parallel-group, double-blind design. Approximately 50 parent–child dyads will be recruited from early intervention services and the community (via posters and social media) across Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories. Eligible participants are parents (main caregivers with ≥50% caregiving responsibility) of children aged 2–6 years with a clinical diagnosis of a developmental disability (including, but not limited to, intellectual disability, developmental delay, or autism spectrum disorder). Parents must be able to converse in Chinese and wish to improve their child’s participation in four community activities identified from the Young Children’s Participation and Environment Measure (YC-PEM). Children with DD combined with significant physical (e.g., cerebral palsy, spina bifida, amputation) or sensory impairments (e.g., blindness, deafness) are excluded to maintain a relatively homogeneous group regarding community participation needs.\n\nParticipants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the OPC intervention group or the control group using block randomization stratified by whether the child is awaiting or currently receiving early intervention services. Randomization will be computer-generated and conducted by an independent research assistant. Parents and outcome assessors will be blinded to group allocation. Children in both groups will continue to receive usual care (e.g., occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech therapy, center-based training, or be on a waiting list), and parents will complete a therapy-activity log to document the type and dosage of concurrent services.\n\nIn the OPC group, parents will receive 4–8 sessions of coaching delivered weekly or fortnightly, each lasting 30–60 minutes, either in person or via telecommunication methods (e.g., telephone, Zoom, WhatsApp). OPC is structured around three enabling domains: (1) Connect—building a trusting, empathic relationship with parents; (2) Structure—guiding parents through a problem-solving process that includes setting goals, exploring options, planning and carrying out actions, and reviewing performance; and (3) Share—eliciting and valuing parents’ knowledge to support their autonomy. A core technique is collaborative performance analysis, in which the coach and parent jointly explore the current situation, desired outcomes, barriers and facilitators, and required actions for goal achievement. The focus is on enhancing children’s participation, particularly in community activities, through environmental and activity adaptations and parent-led strategy implementation. OPC will be delivered by occupational therapists with at least two years of pediatric/parent experience who have received at least 24 hours of formal OPC training (workshops and mentoring). Intervention fidelity will be monitored using the Occupational Performance Coaching Fidelity Measure Version 3.0, with a minimum acceptable fidelity threshold of 80% per session. Coaching sessions will be audio-recorded for fidelity checks, and ongoing supervision will be provided when self-rated fidelity falls below 80%.\n\nParents in the control group will receive 4–8 sessions of parent consultation of comparable frequency and duration (30–60 minutes), delivered in person or via tele-format. This consultation focuses on providing information about community resources (e.g., public playgrounds, play groups, sports programs) and generic supportive strategies for parents of children with disabilities. A structured toolbox compiled by the research team will guide the consultations. Therapists or occupational therapy students who are not trained in OPC will deliver this intervention using a direct informing approach: they will supply information about environmental resources and strategies, discuss the parents’ current situation and problems, and, if needed, provide basic information about disability and developmental milestones. OPC-specific elements—such as structured action–reflection processes and collaborative performance analysis—will be deliberately avoided. These providers will receive a 2-hour training on the toolbox and consultation procedures and will attend regular supervision sessions.\n\nThe trial has three main objectives: (1) to assess feasibility (recruitment rates, retention, adherence, success of blinding, and intervention fidelity) against predefined criteria; (2) to explore the acceptability of OPC to parents and coaches through qualitative interviews; and (3) to obtain preliminary estimates of OPC’s efficacy, compared to parent consultation, in improving children’s community participation and related outcomes.\n\nAssessments will occur at four time points: (a) 5–6 weeks before intervention (baseline, Time 0); (b) 1–2 weeks before intervention (pre-intervention, Time 1); (c) 1–2 weeks after intervention completion (post-intervention, Time 2); and (d) 8–9 weeks after intervention completion (follow-up, Time 3). The primary outcome measures focus on child participation: (1) the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM), used to identify and rate individualized participation goals in any life domain, with special attention to goals related to community participation for analysis; and (2) the community section of the Young Children’s Participation and Environment Measure (YC-PEM), which assesses the frequency and involvement of the child in 11 community activities and captures parent desire for change. The environmental support scale within the YC-PEM will also be used as an exploratory measure of perceived environmental facilitators and barriers in community settings.\n\nSecondary outcomes target both parents and children. Parent-focused measures include the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale (PSOC) to assess parenting efficacy and satisfaction, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) to evaluate parental emotional distress. Child-focused secondary outcomes include the Kiddy-KINDL (parent-report version) to assess health-related quality of life, particularly psychosocial aspects, and selected domains of the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer-Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT)—daily activities and social/cognitive function—to capture functional performance. Additional exploratory measures will examine mechanisms aligned with self-determination theory: the Session Rating Scale (SRS) to assess therapeutic alliance, and a modified Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ) to measure perceived autonomy support from the coach. A one-item Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) will capture parents’ overall perception of changes in their child’s community participation.\n\nFeasibility will be evaluated against predefined criteria, including target recruitment within a specific timeframe, retention rates, session attendance, successful blinding (assessed by asking parents and assessors to guess group allocation), and OPC fidelity scores. The OPC Fidelity Measure Version 3.0, which comprises 18 items across relationship, goal, reflection, analysis and action, client response, and distinguishing domains, will be applied to audio recordings of a subset of sessions per coach.\n\nAcceptability will be explored via semi-structured interviews with parents in the OPC arm after intervention (Time 2) and with OPC coaches at the end of the study. Parent interviews will address satisfaction with OPC (e.g., alliance, scheduling, duration), perceived learning, likes and dislikes, challenges, and perceived impact on their child’s community participation. Coach interviews will explore their experiences delivering OPC, perceived effectiveness, challenges, views on optimal scheduling/duration, and cultural appropriateness in Hong Kong. Parent transcripts will be analyzed using inductive thematic analysis, and coach transcripts using conventional content analysis. Credibility will be enhanced through code–recode checks, peer debriefing, and team discussions.\n\nFor initial efficacy analyses, repeated-measures ANCOVA will be used to compare changes from pre-intervention to post-intervention and follow-up between the OPC and control groups, adjusting for baseline scores (Time 0), treatment dosage, and mode of delivery. Only community-related COPM goals will be included in the primary participation analysis. Intent-to-treat principles will be applied, with last observation carried forward for missing follow-up data. Effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals will be reported to support sample size calculation for a future definitive RCT. Baseline group differences will be examined with t-tests or Mann–Whitney U tests and chi-square tests as appropriate, and data transformations will be applied if normality assumptions are violated.\n\nThe study anticipates potential challenges, including possible improvements in both groups attributable to goal setting before intervention, differential attrition (particularly if some parents prefer expert-led consultation over coaching), and external constraints on community participation due to public health measures (e.g., COVID-19 restrictions). The investigators plan to model baseline-to-pre-intervention changes, offer structured options for partial withdrawal (e.g., from intervention only but not from follow-up assessments), and closely monitor external restrictions to adjust recruitment or terminate the trial early if necessary. The study has received ethical approval from the Human Subjects Ethics Subcommittee of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and written informed consent will be obtained from all participating parents.\n\nOverall, this pilot RCT will provide critical data on the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of OPC for enhancing community participation among young children with developmental disabilities in Hong Kong, and will guide the design of a fully powered efficacy trial."
