      "briefSummary": "This two-stage, double-blind, randomized, controlled phase II/III trial evaluated a new intra‑articular treatment (JTA‑004) for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis in adults aged 50–79 years. JTA‑004 is an enhanced protein solution derived from human plasma, supplemented with hyaluronic acid and clonidine, designed to provide short‑term pain relief and restore joint homeostasis through formation of a clot-like gel in the joint. In stage one, three different JTA‑004 formulations (varying in clonidine dose and injection volume) were compared with a reference hyaluronic acid product (hylan G‑F 20) to select the most effective formulation based on pain reduction at 3 and 6 months. In stage two, the selected formulation was compared with the reference to test whether it provided superior pain relief at 6 months. Efficacy was assessed mainly by WOMAC pain, function, stiffness, and total scores, along with health‑related quality of life and analgesic/NSAID use. Safety was evaluated by adverse events, laboratory tests, and physical examinations over 6 months after a single injection.",
      "detailedDescription": "This prospective, multicenter, randomized, double‑blind, controlled phase II/III study was conducted in 12 centers in Belgium to assess the safety and efficacy of JTA‑004, an enhanced protein solution for intra‑articular injection in patients with symptomatic primary knee osteoarthritis (OA).\n\nJTA‑004 is derived from human plasma and contains hyaluronic acid (HA) produced by bacterial fermentation and clonidine, an alpha‑2 adrenergic agonist with analgesic properties. Once injected into the knee joint, the plasma component is intended to initiate the coagulation cascade and form a clotting gel. This three‑dimensional network of plasma proteins, hyaluronic acid fibers, and synovial proteins is designed to mimic the mechanical and rheological behavior of normal synovial fluid, providing lubrication and shock‑absorbing properties that may protect cartilage. Clonidine is intended to provide short‑term pain relief around the injection. Overall, JTA‑004 aims to improve local pain and function and potentially delay the need for joint replacement surgery.\n\nThe trial enrolled men and women aged 50–79 years with primary knee OA, Kellgren‑Lawrence grade II or III, body mass index <35 kg/m², and insufficient or failed response to analgesics and/or non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Patients needed to have knee pain ≥40 mm on a 0–100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) in the 3 days before screening, morning stiffness ≤30 minutes, and be able to walk unassisted (crutches or a walking stick were allowed). Patients had to agree to abstain from knee physical therapy and braces during the study.\n\nThe study used a two‑stage design with an interim analysis. In stage one, patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive a single intra‑articular injection of one of three JTA‑004 formulations or a reference treatment, hylan G‑F 20 (Synvisc‑One®), a well‑established hyaluronic acid derivative. The three JTA‑004 formulations differed by clonidine concentration and injection volume but contained the same HA concentration (10 mg/ml):\n- JTA‑100/2: 2 ml injection with 2.04 g plasma protein solution (1.02 g/ml), 100 μg clonidine (50 μg/ml), 20 mg HA (10 mg/ml).\n- JTA‑200/2: 2 ml injection with 2.04 g plasma protein solution (1.02 g/ml), 200 μg clonidine (100 μg/ml), 20 mg HA (10 mg/ml).\n- JTA‑200/4: 4 ml injection with 4.08 g plasma protein solution (1.02 g/ml), 200 μg clonidine (50 μg/ml), 40 mg HA (10 mg/ml).\n\nThe reference group received a 6 ml injection of hylan G‑F 20 containing 48 mg sodium hyaluronate. JTA‑004 was supplied as a freeze‑dried powder for reconstitution with sterile water immediately before use. Injections were performed into the target knee via a lateral mid‑patellar or other standard intra‑articular portal. If joint effusion was present, it was aspirated before injection. Use of local anesthesia was at the physician’s discretion. Patients were monitored for 45 minutes after injection and advised to rest and apply ice for pain control.\n\nThe primary objective of the first stage was to identify the most effective JTA‑004 formulation by comparing adjusted mean changes from baseline in the WOMAC (Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) Pain Subscale Score at 3 months between each JTA group and the reference group. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) performed an interim analysis when 116 patients had completed 3 months of follow‑up or discontinued, using an ANCOVA model adjusted for baseline values and Dunnett’s correction for multiple comparisons. Because 3‑month findings were inconclusive, pre‑specified 6‑month data were also considered. Based on the largest advantage in pain reduction at 6 months, JTA‑200/2 (200 μg clonidine, 20 mg HA, 2 ml) was selected for stage two.\n\nThe primary objective of the second stage was to demonstrate superiority of the selected JTA‑200/2 formulation over hylan G‑F 20, defined as an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the between‑group difference (JTA‑200/2 minus reference) in adjusted mean change from baseline in WOMAC Pain Subscale Score at 6 months that was less than 0. Secondary endpoints included WOMAC Total Score and WOMAC Pain Subscale Score at 3 months. Exploratory endpoints included WOMAC Pain Subscale over all timepoints, WOMAC Physical Function and Stiffness Subscales, WOMAC Total Score at 6 months, SF‑12 physical and mental component scores, and consumption of analgesics and NSAIDs.\n\nPatients were followed on the day of injection and at approximately 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. WOMAC VA3.1 scores (pain, stiffness, physical function) were collected as self‑administered VAS‑based questionnaires (0–100 mm, higher values indicating worse symptoms). The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was defined as 20% or at least 10 mm improvement from baseline. Health‑related quality of life was determined by the SF‑12 questionnaire. Analgesic and NSAID use was recorded using patient diaries. Safety evaluations included adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), treatment‑related and procedure‑related events, vital signs, physical examination findings, and routine laboratory parameters (hematology, chemistry, coagulation).\n\nSample‑size calculations assumed a mean between‑group difference of −7 mm in WOMAC Pain Subscale Score change from baseline at 6 months (favoring JTA‑004) with a standard deviation (SD) of 10.5 mm, requiring 37 patients per group for 80% power at a two‑sided alpha of 0.05. Accounting for 10% drop‑out, 41 patients per group (164 total) were planned. At the interim analysis, because observed variability of the primary endpoint was much larger (SD 25–30 mm), the IDMC recommended increasing the sample size to 76 patients per group to avoid underpowering the study, but this recommendation was not implemented; recruitment stopped at the originally planned 41 patients per group.\n\nAt final analysis, 164 randomized patients were treated (41 per group), and 147 completed the 6‑month follow‑up. Baseline characteristics were comparable across groups: mean age 62.7 years, 68.3% female, mean BMI 28.5 kg/m², and Kellgren‑Lawrence grade II in 55.5% and III in 44.5% of patients.\n\nIn the interim analysis, all three JTA‑004 formulations showed greater reductions from baseline in WOMAC Pain Subscale Score than the reference at 3 and 6 months, but with broad CIs. At 3 months the largest difference versus reference favored JTA‑200/4, while at 6 months the largest difference favored JTA‑200/2. Similarly, for WOMAC Total and Physical Function Subscale Scores, JTA‑200/4 appeared most favorable at 3 months and JTA‑200/2 at 6 months. Based on trends at 6 months, the IDMC selected JTA‑200/2 as the most effective formulation, with no major safety concerns noted.\n\nIn the final analysis, mean baseline WOMAC Pain Subscale Scores were 56.2 mm in the JTA‑200/2 group and 46.5 mm in the reference group. At 6 months, adjusted mean changes in WOMAC Pain Subscale Score from baseline (without imputing missing data) were −23.6 mm (SE 4.6) with JTA‑200/2 and −14.1 mm (SE 4.3) with hylan G‑F 20, yielding a between‑group difference of −9.49 mm (95% CI −22.21 to 3.23; p=0.141). This difference exceeded the pre‑defined MCID of 10 mm and suggested a clinically relevant advantage for JTA‑200/2 but did not meet the statistical criteria for superiority. With missing‑data imputation, the between‑group difference was attenuated (−4.69 mm; 95% CI −16.90 to 7.52; p=0.447).\n\nAt 3 months, adjusted mean changes in pain were −26.8 mm (SE 3.9) for JTA‑200/2 and −15.1 mm (SE 3.7) for the reference, a between‑group difference of −11.63 mm (95% CI −22.60 to −0.66; p=0.038), which did not reach the stricter multiplicity‑adjusted significance threshold (p<0.025) specified for secondary endpoints.\n\nFor the WOMAC Total Score, adjusted mean changes at 3 months were −22.3 mm (SE 3.8) with JTA‑200/2 and −19.4 mm (SE 3.6) with the reference; at 6 months, −23.7 mm (SE 4.3) and −16.5 mm (SE 4.1), respectively. None of the between‑group differences achieved statistical significance. Similar patterns were observed for the WOMAC Physical Function Subscale and Stiffness Subscale: both groups improved over time, and JTA‑200/2 generally showed numerically greater improvements, but differences were not statistically significant.\n\nSF‑12 physical and mental scores showed high variability, and no clear differences could be drawn between groups. Analgesic and NSAID consumption did not demonstrate consistent or clinically meaningful differences between treatment arms.\n\nPost‑hoc exploratory analyses examined the non‑selected JTA‑004 formulations and pooled all JTA‑004 groups. In the JTA‑100/2 and JTA‑200/4 groups, pain scores improved over time, with statistical significance versus reference at 3 months only for JTA‑200/4. When data from all three JTA‑004 formulations were pooled, the magnitude of improvement in WOMAC Pain Subscale Score exceeded that of the reference group at both 3 and 6 months. At 3 months, adjusted mean changes were −27.2 mm (SE 2.2) for pooled JTA versus −16.4 mm (SE 3.7) for reference, yielding a difference of −10.79 mm (p=0.014). At 6 months, adjusted mean changes were −26.1 mm (SE 2.4) versus −15.6 mm (SE 4.1), a difference of −10.57 mm (p=0.030). These differences were both statistically significant and clinically meaningful (greater than 10 mm). For WOMAC Physical Function, the pooled JTA group also showed larger improvements than reference, with a statistically significant difference at 3 months (−8.97 mm; p=0.040) and a borderline difference at 6 months (−9.40 mm; p=0.053). However, pooled analyses did not demonstrate a significant difference in WOMAC Total Score.\n\nSafety assessments showed that JTA‑004 had a clinically acceptable safety profile. Over a mean follow‑up of 6.3 months, 70.7% of patients experienced at least one AE, with similar overall incidence across treatment groups. A total of 49 AEs were considered related to study treatment: 5 in 3 (7.3%) patients in JTA‑100/2, 12 in 8 (19.5%) in JTA‑200/2, 15 in 12 (29.3%) in JTA‑200/4, and 17 in 11 (26.8%) in the reference group. Fewer treatment‑related and procedure‑related AEs occurred in the JTA‑100/2 arm. Common treatment‑ or procedure‑related events included arthralgia, injection site pain, and transient hypotension. Mild, short‑lasting hypotension after injection occurred in four patients in JTA‑200/4 and two in JTA‑200/2 and was not seen in JTA‑100/2 or the reference group. These events were potentially related to clonidine’s pharmacologic effect or vasovagal reactions.\n\nEleven SAEs occurred in eight patients across all groups; no individual SAE occurred in more than one patient. One JTA‑200/2 patient experienced an acute osteomyelitis event and two chronic osteomyelitis events at the injection site, initially reported as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR). After detailed review, these events were judged not related to the study treatment or injection procedure. Two AEs led to study withdrawal (one arthralgia in JTA‑100/2 and one osteomyelitis case in JTA‑200/2). No deaths were reported.\n\nOverall, the study suggests that a single intra‑articular injection of JTA‑004 is safe and may provide clinically relevant improvements in pain and function comparable to or greater than those achieved with hylan G‑F 20 in patients with symptomatic knee OA. However, due to higher than anticipated variability and underpowering, the trial did not demonstrate formal statistical superiority of the selected JTA‑200/2 formulation over the reference for the primary endpoint. Post‑hoc pooled analyses indicate a potentially clinically meaningful benefit of JTA‑004, supporting further investigation. Given its favorable safety profile and comparable efficacy, the JTA‑100/2 formulation was ultimately selected for future phase III studies. Larger, adequately powered randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of JTA‑004 and clarify its role as a minimally invasive viscosupplement option aimed at controlling pain and delaying knee joint replacement surgery."
