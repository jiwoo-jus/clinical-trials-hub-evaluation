      "briefSummary": "This multicenter phase 3 clinical trial (JUVE-BRIGHT) is evaluating whether the oral Janus kinase (JAK) 1/2 inhibitor baricitinib is effective and safe for treating children and adolescents with juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis (JIA-uveitis) or chronic anterior antinuclear antibody (ANA)-positive uveitis without systemic features who have not responded adequately to topical eye steroids and methotrexate and/or biologic drugs. At least 20 and up to 40 patients aged 2 to under 18 years with active anterior uveitis will be enrolled at centers in several European countries. At least 20 methotrexate inadequate responders, who are naïve to biologic DMARDs, will be randomized 1:1 to open-label baricitinib or adalimumab (the current standard biologic therapy), and about 20 additional patients who are methotrexate or biologic inadequate responders will receive open-label baricitinib. Baricitinib is given once daily orally at a fixed dose by age group, while adalimumab is given as subcutaneous injections every 2 weeks. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients achieving a reduction in intraocular inflammation at week 24 according to standardized uveitis criteria. Patients may continue treatment in a long-term open-label extension for up to 5 years. The study uses an open-label Bayesian design with interim futility analyses to allow decision-making in this rare pediatric population and to limit exposure to ineffective treatment.",
      "detailedDescription": "JUVE-BRIGHT is a multicenter, open-label, active-controlled phase 3 trial designed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of baricitinib, an oral selective JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, in pediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis (JIA-uveitis) or chronic anterior antinuclear antibody (ANA)-positive uveitis without systemic features. These conditions represent the most common systemic cause of noninfectious pediatric uveitis and remain associated with a risk of vision loss despite improvements in screening and treatment. Many children fail to respond to, or fail to maintain remission with, methotrexate (MTX) and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), including adalimumab, the only licensed biologic therapy for JIA-uveitis.\n\nRationale: Uveitis in JIA is typically chronic, bilateral, nongranulomatous, and often asymptomatic, and is associated with elevated inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNFα that signal through or are modulated by the JAK/STAT pathway. Baricitinib partially inhibits JAK1 and JAK2, reducing downstream STAT activation and inflammatory responses. Given its established efficacy in adult rheumatoid arthritis and the overlap in immunopathology between RA, JIA, and JIA-uveitis, baricitinib may provide a novel, oral therapeutic option for pediatric uveitis driven by these cytokine pathways.\n\nStudy population and design: The study will enroll at least 20 and up to 40 patients aged 2 to <18 years with active anterior uveitis (SUN anterior chamber cell grade ≥1+ at screening and baseline) and a diagnosis of JIA-uveitis or chronic anterior ANA-positive uveitis without systemic features. All patients must have had an inadequate response or intolerance to MTX at standard pediatric doses (10–25 mg/m²/week) and prior use of topical corticosteroid eye drops; some may also be inadequate responders to bDMARDs. Key exclusion criteria include uveitis not associated with JIA or ANA-positive chronic anterior uveitis, other autoimmune inflammatory diseases, significant ocular comorbidities (e.g., markedly elevated intraocular pressure, recent intraocular surgery), prior JAK inhibitor use, recent or unstable use of other immunosuppressive therapies, high-dose systemic steroids, a history of venous thromboembolism, and certain infections such as complicated herpes zoster.\n\nInterventions: Patients aged 2 to <18 years will receive either baricitinib once daily orally (tablet or suspension) or adalimumab subcutaneously every 2 weeks. Baricitinib dosing is fixed by age group: 4 mg once daily for patients aged ≥6 to <18 years and 2 mg once daily for patients <6 years. Adalimumab dosing is weight-based: 20 mg for patients weighing <30 kg and 40 mg for those ≥30 kg. Background conventional synthetic DMARDs (including MTX), low-dose systemic corticosteroids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are allowed if doses are stable. In the initial 24-week treatment period (part A), at least 20 MTX-inadequate responder (MTX-IR) patients who are bDMARD-naïve will be randomized 1:1 to baricitinib or adalimumab (open-label). Approximately 20 additional patients who are MTX-IR or biologic-IR will receive open-label baricitinib. Patients assigned to adalimumab who experience treatment failure after at least 24 weeks may be rescued with baricitinib for the remainder of the study.\n\nLong-term extension: Patients who complete the 24-week period can enter a long-term open-label extension (part B) with treatment for up to 5 years. Baricitinib-treated patients continue baricitinib. Adalimumab-treated patients continue adalimumab for an additional 96 weeks (approximately 2 years total exposure, reflecting current practice) and then switch to baricitinib for the remaining extension period. Dose/formulation adjustments for baricitinib in part B are based on age (e.g., transitioning from suspension to tablets and increasing to 4 mg once daily when patients age out of the younger strata), while adalimumab dose escalation is permitted when sustained weight increases cross the 30-kg threshold.\n\nPrimary and secondary endpoints: The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with a uveitis response at week 24, defined using Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) criteria as at least a 2-step decrease in anterior chamber cell grade or a decrease to zero in the most severely affected eye at baseline. Key secondary outcomes include changes in SUN grades of anterior chamber cells in each eye, visual acuity (logMAR), vitreous haze, and flare; time to inactive disease and proportion with inactive anterior uveitis; tapering of concomitant corticosteroids; time to treatment response; and proportion of responders at the end of the extension. Additional outcomes include uveitis-related and arthritis-related disease activity and improvement assessments completed by patients/caregivers and ophthalmologists, pediatric American College of Rheumatology (PediACR) 30/50/70/90/100 response rates in patients with JIA-uveitis, and global uveitis-related disability measures. Safety endpoints encompass adverse events (including serious events), treatment discontinuations or interruptions due to adverse events, laboratory parameters, and specific monitoring for events of special interest such as herpes zoster and venous thromboembolism. An independent clinical event committee adjudicates potential cardiovascular, venous thrombotic events, and noncardiovascular deaths.\n\nDesign and statistical methods: Due to the rarity of JIA-uveitis and ethical constraints on placebo use in the presence of an approved biologic, the study employs an open-label Bayesian design. This approach is intended to maximize information gained from a small sample size while minimizing exposure to potentially ineffective therapy. Two interim futility analyses are planned when 10 and 20 baricitinib-treated patients have completed 24 weeks. At each interim analysis, the posterior probability that the baricitinib response rate is below 40% is calculated; the trial is stopped for futility if this probability exceeds 75%. Operationally, the design corresponds to stopping if ≤2 of 10 or ≤6 of 20 baricitinib-treated patients are responders at the first and second interim analyses, respectively. If the trial proceeds to full enrollment, the final analysis will consider the study positive if the posterior probability is at least 80% that the true baricitinib response rate exceeds 57%, a threshold chosen to match the response rate observed with adalimumab in the pivotal SYCAMORE trial. An observed response in at least 20 of 30 baricitinib-treated patients corresponds to meeting this criterion. Descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals will summarize efficacy and safety. An exploratory analysis will compare response rates between MTX-IR patients treated with baricitinib versus those treated with adalimumab.\n\nOperational aspects: The trial is conducted at specialized pediatric rheumatology/ophthalmology centers in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK, under Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. A data monitoring committee of external experts oversees safety and interim analyses according to a predefined charter. Data are collected via electronic data capture with verification against source documents. Pharmacogenetic and other biomarker samples are collected where permitted, and stored for up to 15 years. After completing or discontinuing treatment, participants have a safety follow-up visit approximately 28 days after the last dose. The trial is sponsored by Eli Lilly and Company under license from Incyte and conducted as part of a pediatric investigational plan approved by the EMA Paediatric Committee. The study is registered as EudraCT 2019-000119-10 and NCT04088409."
