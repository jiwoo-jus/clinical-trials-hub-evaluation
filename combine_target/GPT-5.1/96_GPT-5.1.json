      "briefSummary": "This single-blind randomized controlled pilot trial evaluated whether a behavioral economic \"regret lottery\" could increase physical activity and improve pain-related outcomes among U.S. veterans with chronic non-malignant pain. Forty veterans receiving care in a multidisciplinary pain-focused primary care team at a VA medical center were randomized 1:1 to (a) activity trackers plus daily text reminders (control) or (b) the same plus a weekly regret lottery (intervention). All participants were encouraged to increase their weekly steps either by 5% over the previous week or to reach and maintain 150% of their baseline step count. In the intervention arm, participants who met their activity goals had a chance to win $30 or $100 gift cards; those who did not meet the goals were informed of what they would have won had they succeeded. The primary outcome was physical activity (Fitbit step counts and self-reported activity), and secondary outcomes included pain-related physical function, chronic pain severity, depressive symptoms, and opioid use. Over 12 weeks, the regret lottery did not produce significant between-group differences in physical activity, pain, function, depression, or opioid dose, suggesting this incentive strategy may be ineffective for increasing physical activity in this veteran chronic pain population.",
      "detailedDescription": "This study tested a behavioral economic intervention designed to increase physical activity among veterans with chronic non-malignant pain, a group with high rates of chronic pain and opioid use. The rationale is that increased physical activity can reduce pain, improve function, and potentially decrease reliance on opioids, and that behavioral economic strategies such as lotteries with loss aversion elements (\"regret lotteries\") have improved physical activity in other populations.\n\nDesign and setting: The trial was a 12-week, single-blind randomized controlled pilot conducted at the Corporal Michael J. Crescenz VA Medical Center in Philadelphia within a specialty pain-focused primary aligned care team (Pain PACT). Data were collected between July 2019 and January 2020. Patients were blinded to group assignment, while data collectors were not.\n\nParticipants: Forty veterans with chronic non-malignant pain receiving care in the Pain PACT were enrolled. Pain PACT patients typically have chronic primary or secondary pain (non-cancer) and either ongoing or past opioid therapy or substance use disorder. Inclusion criteria included being a Pain PACT patient in the past year and owning a smartphone (iPhone or Android). Exclusion criteria included visual impairment preventing use of texting or the activity tracker and physical disability precluding improvements in walking (e.g., wheelchair-bound). The sample was predominantly white, male, disabled, and middle-aged (mean age 57), with high prevalence of back pain, mood disorders or PTSD, and history of substance use disorder.\n\nRandomization and interventions: Participants were randomized 1:1 to:\n1) Control arm: Fitbit activity tracker plus daily text message reminders to increase physical activity and to sync device data.\n2) Intervention arm: The same Fitbit and daily text reminders plus a weekly regret lottery.\n\nBaseline physical activity was measured via Fitbit step counts over a two-week run-in period before delivery of arm-specific texts. Both arms were encouraged to achieve weekly step goals defined as either a 5% increase in steps relative to the prior week or attaining/maintaining 150% of baseline steps. No standardized exercise program was prescribed; participants individualized their activity type and frequency.\n\nRegret lottery: In the intervention arm, participants who met a weekly activity goal were entered into a lottery with an 18% chance of winning a $30 gift card and a 1% chance of winning a $100 gift card. Participants who failed to meet their activity goals received a \"regret\" message stating what they would have won had they achieved the goal. This combined a lottery incentive with a loss aversion component. All technology functions (online enrollment, randomization, text messaging, lottery administration, and activity tracker integration) were managed through the Way to Health research platform.\n\nOutcomes and measurements:\n- Primary outcome: Physical activity, assessed weekly by (a) Fitbit step counts and (b) the Stanford 7-Day Physical Activity Recall Questionnaire (PAR), capturing minutes of stretching/strengthening and aerobic activity.\n- Secondary outcomes: Assessed at baseline and 12 weeks and included:\n  * Pain-related physical function and interference (Pain Outcomes Questionnaire domains: interference with walking and ADLs, vitality, negative affect, fear of injury/re-injury, each rated 0–10).\n  * Chronic pain severity (0–10 scale) from the same instrument.\n  * Depressive symptoms measured by the PHQ-9 (0–36 total score).\n  * Opioid analgesic use, extracted from the electronic health record for the prior 24 hours in those with opioid prescriptions. Buprenorphine/naloxone doses were summarized separately due to the lack of standard morphine milligram equivalent (MME) conversions.\n\nAnalysis: Demographics and baseline measures were summarized to assess randomization balance. Categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests; continuous variables using Wilcoxon or t-tests. For weekly step-goal attainment, the proportion of participant-weeks achieving goals was calculated and trends over time were tested using the Cochran-Armitage trend test. Absolute and percent changes from baseline to 12 weeks for all primary and secondary measures were calculated. Between-arm comparisons used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) general linear models with baseline values as covariates and 12-week scores as dependent variables.\n\nResults: Of 114 approached veterans, 40 enrolled; 38 (95%) completed the 12-week protocol. Missing step data were minimal and similar across arms (about 5% of participant-weeks). The mean unadjusted proportion of participant-weeks in which step goals were achieved was 0.31 (SD 0.09) in the control arm and 0.29 (SD 0.14) in the intervention arm. The proportion achieving step goals did not change over time in the control arm but declined over time in the intervention arm (one-sided Cochran-Armitage p = 0.03).\n\nLottery engagement: In the intervention arm (n=20), 14 participants (70%) met an activity goal at least once and thus became eligible for the lottery. Fourteen participants (70%) received payments during the trial: 13 (65%) won $30 at least once, and 3 (15%) won $100 at least once; some received both amounts. Four lottery winners (20%) never claimed their winnings. Among those who claimed, total earnings ranged from $30 to $300. Most participants (80%) received at least one regret message indicating a forgone $30 or $100 prize. No adverse events were reported.\n\nPrimary outcome findings: Baseline daily steps (mean [SD]) were 5907 (3961) in the control arm and 3635 (3873.5) in the intervention arm, with no significant difference. Over 12 weeks, the percent change in step counts was not statistically different between groups (p = 0.49): the control arm exhibited a 29% decrease, while the intervention arm showed a 36% increase, but the difference did not reach significance in this small pilot sample. PAR stretching/strengthening and aerobic activity scores showed substantial increases in both arms, but no statistically significant between-group differences in percent change.\n\nSecondary outcome findings: Chronic pain severity at baseline was high and similar between groups (mean scores ~6–7/10). Pain severity increased slightly in the control arm and decreased in the intervention arm, but percent changes were not significantly different. For pain-related physical function and interference (walking, ADLs, vitality, negative affect, and fear of reinjury), baseline values and changes over time did not differ significantly between arms, although there was a non-significant trend toward greater improvement or less deterioration in the intervention group.\n\nDepressive symptoms (PHQ-9) were comparable at baseline (mean ~10 in both arms). Over 12 weeks, depressive symptoms increased by 37% in the control arm and 11% in the intervention arm; this difference was not statistically significant.\n\nAmong the 27 participants on opioid analgesics at baseline, distribution of buprenorphine/naloxone and other opioids was similar between arms. Baseline buprenorphine doses and MMEs of other opioids did not significantly differ. There were no significant between-group differences in the percent change of buprenorphine/naloxone doses or other opioid MMEs over the study.\n\nInterpretation: The regret lottery, when added to activity tracking and daily text reminders, did not significantly increase physical activity, nor did it significantly improve pain severity, pain-related function, depression, or opioid use compared with control in this 12-week pilot trial among veterans with chronic pain. Potential explanations include limited power from the small sample, short follow-up period (which may be inadequate to detect changes in chronic pain or opioid tapering), and population characteristics (highly comorbid, specialty pain clinic patients who may be less responsive to such incentives). The effect size of regret-lottery interventions might be smaller in this complex veteran population than in previously studied non-chronic pain or non-veteran samples.\n\nConclusions: In this pilot RCT involving veterans with chronic non-malignant pain, a weekly regret lottery did not yield significant improvements in physical activity or pain-related clinical outcomes beyond those achieved with activity trackers and daily reminders alone. While feasibility and acceptability appeared reasonable, future research may require larger samples, longer durations, or alternative behavioral economic designs to determine whether incentive-based interventions can effectively increase physical activity and reduce pain and opioid use in veteran populations with chronic pain."
