      "briefSummary": "This study, called the Heart Watch Study, is a prospective, open-label, multicenter randomized clinical trial that compares two wearable devices in people with atrial fibrillation and/or atrial flutter who are undergoing electrical cardioversion. Participants are randomly assigned to receive either an Apple Watch Series 6, which includes heart rate tracking, irregular rhythm notifications, single‑lead ECG, and pulse oximetry, or a Withings Move, which tracks activity and sleep but does not provide cardiopulmonary measurements. Using a patient‑centered data platform (Hugo) to collect electronic health records, device data, and surveys, the trial aims to determine whether the advanced cardiopulmonary features of the Apple Watch affect patients’ quality of life and healthcare use over 12 months. The main hypothesis is that use of the Apple Watch features will lead to a different (potentially improved) atrial fibrillation–related quality of life at 6 months compared with a control device, and that it may also influence healthcare utilization and the accuracy of rhythm and oxygen saturation measurements in routine care.",
      "detailedDescription": "The Heart Watch Study is a pragmatic, prospective, open‑label, multicenter randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the clinical impact of consumer wearable technology in patients with atrial fibrillation and/or atrial flutter. The trial specifically focuses on cardiopulmonary features of the Apple Watch Series 6, including continuous heart rate monitoring, irregular rhythm notification algorithms, on‑demand single‑lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and pulse oximetry, and compares these to a control wearable (Withings Move) that provides activity and sleep tracking but no ECG, rhythm notification, or oxygen saturation measurements.\n\nA total of 150 adult participants (age >22 years) with a history of atrial fibrillation and/or atrial flutter who are scheduled for direct current cardioversion are enrolled across three U.S. academic health systems: Yale New Haven Health, Mayo Clinic, and Duke Health. Participants must own a compatible iPhone, live independently, be English‑speaking, receive cardiology care at one of the study centers, and have primary care at a health system that can be connected to the Hugo Health platform. After informed consent, subjects are randomized 1:1, stratified by site, to receive either an Apple Watch Series 6 (GPS) or a Withings Move. They are asked to wear only the assigned device as much as possible during the study period, aside from charging or unsuitable environments.\n\nThe primary outcome is the change in the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy-of-life (AFEQT) global score from baseline to 6 months. AFEQT is a validated, 20‑item, atrial fibrillation–specific health‑related quality‑of‑life instrument that yields an overall score (0–100) from domains of symptoms, daily activities, and treatment concern; higher scores represent better quality of life, and a change of approximately 5 points is considered clinically meaningful.\n\nSecondary outcomes encompass three domains: (1) additional patient‑reported outcomes, (2) healthcare utilization, and (3) device‑specific performance metrics in the Apple Watch arm.\n\nPatient‑reported secondary outcomes include: longitudinal changes in AFEQT global and domain scores at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 12 months; anticoagulation persistence at multiple time points (assessed using items adapted from the Brief Medication Questionnaire); continued or discontinued use of the assigned wearable and any use of other personal digital devices; patient responses to abnormal or worrisome device notifications, including whether they contacted a clinician and what occurred; and patients’ technology experience and their feelings of reassurance or anxiety regarding overall health and atrial fibrillation, as well as confidence in engaging in physical and usual activities. Apple Watch users are additionally queried about the frequency of notifications and use of the ECG function to evaluate heart rhythm during symptoms.\n\nHealthcare utilization outcomes are assessed using aggregated electronic health record data accessed and shared by participants through the Hugo platform. Four composite endpoints are evaluated at 6 and 12 months: (1) rhythm control intervention (additional cardioversion, initiation or dose escalation of antiarrhythmic medication, switching to a different antiarrhythmic agent, or atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter ablation); (2) acute care utilization (emergency department visits, observation stays, and hospitalizations); (3) outpatient care utilization (primary care visits, cardiology/electrophysiology visits, and scheduled telephone encounters); and (4) rhythm‑related diagnostic testing (number of 12‑lead ECGs and ambulatory rhythm monitoring studies). These comparisons are designed to determine whether the Apple Watch’s cardiopulmonary features are associated with increased or decreased healthcare use relative to the control device.\n\nAmong Apple Watch recipients, the study also evaluates technical performance. Investigators will count irregular rhythm notifications and high‑ and low‑heart‑rate alerts. Apple Watch single‑lead ECG tracings (10‑second, high‑quality, low‑artifact recordings) are compared with near‑simultaneous 12‑lead ECGs obtained in routine care, ideally within 30 minutes, to assess agreement in rhythm classification, heart rate, and ECG intervals (PR, QRS, QT), including inter‑ and intra‑observer reliability. In addition, Apple Watch pulse oximetry readings are compared with standard medical‑grade pulse oximeter measurements collected during clinical encounters, with paired values entered into study surveys when coordinators are present.\n\nData capture is mediated through the Hugo patient‑centered health data sharing platform, which aggregates electronic health records from multiple health systems using Blue Button and application programming interfaces, as well as personal device data (Apple HealthKit or Withings Health Mate), pharmacy information, and Medicare claims when available. Hugo also delivers and collects digital patient‑reported outcome measures via secure links sent by text or email, thereby enabling decentralized follow‑up without traditional in‑person study visits. Importantly, data are shared voluntarily by participants with the research team and are not drawn directly from health systems; study investigators do not monitor these data in real time for clinical care, and participants are instructed to seek standard medical attention for concerning symptoms.\n\nThe sample size of 150 participants (75 per arm) provides 80% power, at a two‑sided alpha of 0.05, to detect a differential change of 8.8 points in the AFEQT global score at 6 months between the Apple Watch and control arms, accounting for an anticipated 8% rate of missing 6‑month AFEQT data. Statistical analysis plans include use of t‑tests (or non‑parametric alternatives) to compare continuous outcomes (AFEQT scores and utilization composites) between groups, and intraclass correlation coefficients for ECG agreement metrics. For missing patient‑reported outcomes, the last observation will be carried forward; for utilization outcomes, analyses will include only periods with available connected data.\n\nThe trial is approved by institutional review boards at Yale University, Mayo Clinic, and Duke University Health System. Given the low‑risk nature of consumer wearable devices, a formal data safety monitoring board was not convened. Device‑related adverse events, if any, will be reported to the FDA’s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. The study is registered as NCT04468321.\n\nOverall, this trial is intended to provide independent evidence on how widely used wearable technologies with cardiopulmonary features affect disease‑specific quality of life, healthcare utilization, patient experience, and measurement accuracy among patients with atrial fibrillation and/or atrial flutter undergoing cardioversion. The findings may inform clinicians, patients, policymakers, regulators, and payers regarding labeling, risk mitigation, and coverage decisions for digital health technologies."
