      "briefSummary": "This qualitative sub-study of the CHOICES trial assessed the experiences of participants with HIV and opioid use disorder (OUD) who were randomized to extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX). The study aimed to identify facilitators and barriers to successful XR-NTX induction through semi-structured interviews with participants who either successfully completed or failed to complete the induction process.",
      "detailedDescription": "The CHOICES study (Comparing Treatments for HIV-Infected Opioid Users in an Integrated Care Effectiveness Study) randomized participants with HIV and opioid use disorder (OUD) to HIV clinic-based extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) versus treatment-as-usual (buprenorphine or methadone). Because XR-NTX requires a complete cessation of opioids prior to initiation (induction), this process presents significant barriers. This qualitative analysis involved semi-structured interviews with a convenience sample of 37 participants (20 who completed induction, 17 who did not) across five HIV clinics between 2018 and 2019. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using Thematic Analysis to identify themes related to the induction experience. Key findings explored readiness for change, the role of supportive environments and comfort medications during withdrawal, staff interactions, anxiety regarding withdrawal symptoms, ambivalence toward stopping opioid use, and perceptions of XR-NTX effects versus agonist therapies."
