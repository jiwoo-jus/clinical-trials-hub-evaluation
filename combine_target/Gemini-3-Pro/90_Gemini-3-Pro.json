      "briefSummary": "This pilot randomized trial aimed to test the acceptability and effects of an automated digital Mobile Support Tool for Mental Health (MoST-MH) for young adults transitioning to college. The researchers hypothesized that youth would engage with MoST-MH at high rates over the first 3 months of college and report high levels of usability. Additionally, it was hypothesized that youth receiving MoST-MH, compared to those receiving enhanced usual care (eUC), would report greater mental health self-efficacy, lower symptom severity, and higher rates of follow-through with mental health care at 3 months.",
      "detailedDescription": "Participants aged 18 years and older with a current mental health diagnosis preparing to transition to college were recruited from primary care and mental health clinics. They were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either receive MoST-MH or enhanced Usual Care (eUC). \n\nMoST-MH is an ecological momentary intervention designed to provide support independent of mental health diagnosis type. It included periodic text message and web-based check-ins regarding emotional health, stressors, negative impacts, and self-efficacy. These inputs informed tailored self-care support messages and triggered links to psychoeducational videos. The intervention used a stepwise algorithm to adapt the frequency of interaction based on the needs of the youth. \n\nBoth eUC and MoST-MH participants received links to a library of psychoeducational videos. Participants were asked to complete web-based versions of the Mental Health Self-Efficacy Scale (MHSES), College Counseling Center Assessment of Psychological Symptoms (CCAPS), and Client Service Receipt Inventory for Mental Health (C-SRI) monthly for 3 months. The Post-Study System Usability Scale (PSSUQ) was administered at the 3-month mark to evaluate the tool's usability."
