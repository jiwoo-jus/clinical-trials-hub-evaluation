      "briefSummary": "The Heart Watch Study is a prospective, open-label multicentre pragmatic randomised clinical trial designed to evaluate the impact of the Apple Watch and its accompanying health features (heart rate measurement, irregular rhythm notification, and ECG) on patient-reported outcomes and healthcare utilisation. The study focuses on patients with a history of atrial fibrillation and/or atrial flutter who are scheduled for cardioversion. A total of 150 participants are randomised 1:1 to receive either the Apple Watch Series 6 or the Withings Move. The primary outcome is the difference in the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy-of-life (AFEQT) global score at 6 months postcardioversion.",
      "detailedDescription": "Despite the widespread use of personal digital devices with cardiopulmonary tracking features, data regarding their impact on patient-reported outcomes and healthcare utilisation remain sparse. This study aims to address this gap by leveraging a unique patient-centred health data sharing platform, Hugo, for enrolment and follow-up. The platform aggregates electronic health data from hospitals, physicians' offices, and personal digital devices.\n\nParticipants are recruited from three academic health systems: Yale New Haven Health, Mayo Clinic, and Duke Health. Eligible patients are those aged >22 years, undergoing cardioversion for atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, and possessing a compatible iPhone. Patients are randomised to receive either an Apple Watch Series 6 (intervention arm) or a Withings Move (control arm). The Apple Watch allows for heart rate monitoring, irregular rhythm notifications, single-lead ECG, and pulse oximetry, whereas the Withings Move tracks activity and sleep but lacks ECG and irregular rhythm notification capabilities.\n\nThe primary endpoint is the change in quality of life as measured by the AFEQT global score at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include healthcare utilisation (inpatient and outpatient), anticoagulation persistence, patient anxiety or reassurance, and the accuracy of the Apple Watch ECG and pulse oximeter features compared to gold-standard clinical data. The study seeks to inform policymakers, clinicians, and patients about the clinical utility and impact of these widely used consumer technologies."
