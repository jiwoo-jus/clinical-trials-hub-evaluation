      "briefSummary": "Cholera remains a major cause of diarrheal illness and death, particularly in settings with poor sanitation. This study evaluated a synthetic chemical named iOWH032, a potential oral treatment for cholera designed to block secretions from intestinal cells and prevent fluid loss (dehydration). The study utilized a cholera controlled human infection model (CHIM) where healthy volunteers were intentionally infected with Vibrio cholerae in an inpatient clinic setting. The trial aimed to determine if iOWH032 could safely reduce cholera illness and diarrheal symptoms compared to a placebo.",
      "detailedDescription": "This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, group-sequential Phase 2a study to assess the preliminary clinical efficacy and safety of the small molecule antisecretory drug candidate iOWH032. iOWH032 is a synthetic inhibitor of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel, intended to counteract the hypersecretion caused by cholera toxin.\n\nForty-seven healthy adult subjects (aged 18 to 44 years) were experimentally challenged with 10^6 colony-forming units of Vibrio cholerae El Tor Inaba strain N16961. Participants were randomized to receive either 500 mg of iOWH032 or a matching placebo orally every 8 hours for 3 days, starting at the onset of diarrhea symptoms or 48 hours after the challenge. \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the diarrheal stool output rate (total volume of diarrheal stools divided by the time between study drug initiation and antimicrobial therapy). Secondary endpoints included the proportion of subjects with moderate or severe cholera, total stool volume, duration of diarrhea, and microbiological shedding of the bacteria. Safety assessments monitored adverse events and vital signs throughout the inpatient containment period and follow-up."
