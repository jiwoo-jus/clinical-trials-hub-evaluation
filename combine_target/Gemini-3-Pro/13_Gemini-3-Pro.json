      "briefSummary": "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study aims to estimate the efficacy and safety of cabergoline, a novel nonhormonal therapeutic agent, compared with the standard clinical therapy, norethindrone acetate (NETA), for the treatment of endometriosis-associated pain in young women. The study hypothesizes that cabergoline will inhibit endometriosis-mediated neuroangiogenesis, leading to decreased pain measures, improved functional disability scores, and decreased circulating angiogenic and inflammatory biomarkers.",
      "detailedDescription": "Endometriosis is a chronic condition where the growth of lesions requires angiogenesis. While hormonal therapies like NETA are standard, they often have limitations regarding side effects and recurrence. This study investigates cabergoline, a dopamine receptor 2 (DRD2) agonist, which functions as an inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway, offering a potential nonhormonal treatment option.\n\nParticipants included premenopausal women aged 15–40 years with surgically confirmed endometriosis and reported pelvic pain. They were randomized to receive either oral NETA (5 mg/day) combined with a placebo twice weekly, or oral cabergoline (0.5 mg) twice weekly combined with a placebo daily for a duration of 6 months.\n\nThe primary outcome measure was the assessment of pain using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) interference scale and a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain intensity. Secondary measures included the Beck Depression Inventory-II for emotional functioning, the Functional Disability Inventory, and the patient global impression of change. Additionally, serum samples were analyzed for angiogenic and inflammatory biomarkers, including VEGF-R1, TNF-alpha, and IL-8. Safety was monitored through adverse event reporting and laboratory parameters such as liver function tests and lipid panels."
