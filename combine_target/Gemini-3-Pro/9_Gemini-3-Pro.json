      "briefSummary": "This randomized controlled trial evaluates the efficacy of 'Proud & Empowered' (P&E), a school-based intervention designed for sexual and gender minority adolescents (SGMA). The study hypothesizes that youth participating in the P&E program will report significantly fewer minority stress experiences and improved behavioral health symptomology (depression, PTSD, anxiety, and suicidality) compared to youth in a control group. Additionally, the study examines whether participation in the program moderates the relationship between minority stress and mental health symptoms, thereby improving coping mechanisms.",
      "detailedDescription": "The study was conducted as a randomized controlled trial across four public high schools in Southern California to assess the Proud & Empowered (P&E) intervention. P&E is a 10-session small group program derived from the Sexual Minority Adolescent Stress Inventory (SMASI) domains, covering topics such as stress and coping, disclosure decision-making, family, school-related stress, peers, safety, spirituality, and LGBT community history. Schools were randomly assigned to either the intervention condition, where students attended weekly 45-minute sessions, or a control condition where students attended school as usual.\n\nData collection occurred at pretest (one week prior to the intervention) and posttest (one week after the last session). The study utilized specific measures to assess outcomes: the SMASI for minority stress, the Beck Anxiety Inventory for anxiety, the Beck Depression Inventory II for depression, the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 for PTSD, and the adapted Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale for suicidality. Analyses included repeated-measures ANOVA to determine differences between groups over time and moderation analyses to investigate if the intervention mitigated the impact of minority stress on mental health outcomes."
