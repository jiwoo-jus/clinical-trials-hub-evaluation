      "briefSummary": "This prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, multicenter study evaluated the technical performance of the Emprint™ ablation system in predicting the size of ablation zones in patients with metastatic or primary lung tumors. Subjects scheduled for resection underwent preoperative percutaneous microwave ablation. The study compared ablation zones predicted by the system software against actual ablation zones measured via CT imaging immediately post-ablation. Secondary endpoints included histological assessment of complete ablation.",
      "detailedDescription": "The study utilized the Emprint™ procedure planning application, an interactive tool designed to predict microwave ablation zone size based on time, energy, and target tissue type. The primary objective was to evaluate the accuracy of these predictions in a clinical setting using an 'ablate and resect' methodology.\n\nParticipants included adult subjects with at least one pulmonary metastasis or primary lung cancer (≤3.0 cm) eligible for surgical resection. Ablations were performed using a percutaneous approach. The primary endpoint was dose response, assessed by calculating the percentage difference between the predicted ablation zone dimensions (width, height, depth, volume, and shape) and the actual dimensions measured on CT images acquired immediately after ablation with the antenna still in place.\n\nFollowing the ablation and imaging, patients underwent surgical resection of the tumor. The secondary endpoint was complete ablation, defined as 100% non-viable tumor cells confirmed by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen (NADH) staining on the resected specimens. Safety endpoints tracked the type, incidence, and severity of adverse events from anesthesia administration through the first post-operative follow-up."
