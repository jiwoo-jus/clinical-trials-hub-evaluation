      "briefSummary": "This study aims to test a multifaceted implementation strategy in partnership with a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) system serving low-income families in Southern California to support the \"ACEs Aware\" policy. The policy promotes adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) screening for children. The study will use a hybrid type 2, stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial design with five primary care clinics to determine if the strategy improves fidelity to screening protocols, the proportion of eligible children screened, and child-level mental health referrals and outcomes.",
      "detailedDescription": "Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are potentially traumatic events occurring before age 18. While California's \"ACEs Aware\" policy provides reimbursement for ACE screening, policy directives alone often do not translate into effective screening. This study addresses this gap by using Implementation Mapping and the EPIS framework to co-create and refine an implementation strategy.\n\nThe proposed strategy includes online training videos, a customized algorithm, technology to improve workflow efficiency, implementation training for internal FQHC personnel, clinic support/coaching, and written protocols. \n\nThe study has two main aims:\n1. Use a participatory approach to refine a multifaceted implementation strategy to support the ACE screening policy in community-based clinics.\n2. Pilot test the feasibility, acceptability, fidelity, and reach of the implementation strategy, and the impact of the ACE policy on child patient-level outcomes.\n\nThe design is a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial (SW-CRT) involving five clinics serving 3000 children ages 0–5 years. It will test primary hypotheses regarding fidelity and reach, and secondary hypotheses regarding mental health referrals and symptom outcomes. Data collection involves mixed methods, utilizing electronic health records, surveys, and interviews with clinic personnel and caregivers."
