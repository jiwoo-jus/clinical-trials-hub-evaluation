      "briefSummary": "This Phase 2 double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of bepirovirsen, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA. The study involved individuals with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), including both treatment-naïve participants and those receiving stable nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) therapy. The primary objective was to assess the safety profile of bepirovirsen, while secondary objectives assessed antiviral activity, specifically the reduction of serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) concentrations and HBV DNA.",
      "detailedDescription": "Chronic HBV infection is associated with significant morbidity, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Bepirovirsen is a 2′-O-methoxyethyl (2′-MOE) gapmer antisense oligonucleotide that targets all HBV messenger RNAs, aiming to reduce viral proteins and DNA. In this study (NCT02981602), participants with CHB infection were enrolled from centers in Hong Kong and the Republic of Korea. The trial included a dose-escalation design for treatment-naïve patients (randomized to placebo, bepirovirsen 150 mg, or bepirovirsen 300 mg) and an exploratory cohort for patients on stable NA therapy (randomized to placebo or bepirovirsen 300 mg). Study drug or placebo was administered via subcutaneous injection twice weekly for the first two weeks and once weekly for the subsequent two weeks (total of 4 weeks treatment), followed by a 26-week observation period. Key efficacy endpoints included changes from baseline to Day 29 in serum HBsAg and plasma HBV DNA levels. Safety assessments monitored treatment-emergent adverse events, including injection site reactions and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) flares."
