      "briefSummary": "This study evaluates the feasibility and efficacy of a customized smartphone app-based platform featuring live health coaches for hospitalized patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD). The pilot study compares patients using the app against propensity-matched historical controls to assess outcomes such as hospital readmissions, outpatient cardiovascular follow-up, and enrollment in cardiac rehabilitation.",
      "detailedDescription": "The study is an open-label, single-arm, multi-center clinical trial with stratified enrollment and matched historical controls. Participants included patients aged 21–85 years who underwent PCI for either non-MI symptomatic CAD or acute MI at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital between February 2018 and May 2019. The intervention involved a digital health platform (Wellframe) customized for post-PCI patients, which included a patient-facing mobile app with a daily health checklist, medication reminders, interactive surveys, educational articles, and access to non-clinician live health coaches. \n\nThe primary outcome measured was safety, defined by 30-day all-cause hospital readmission. Secondary outcomes included 90-day all-cause hospital readmission, enrollment in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) within 90 days, and follow-up with a cardiologist within 1 month. Historical controls were identified via 1:3 propensity matching on criteria such as age, sex, PCI type, diabetes status, and insurance type. The study also analyzed engagement metrics, such as task completion and message frequency, to assess the platform's feasibility across different demographics."
