      "briefSummary": "This Phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamics of andecaliximab (ADX), an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), in combination with nivolumab (NIVO) versus nivolumab alone. The study targeted patients with pretreated metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. The primary hypothesis was that targeting MMP9 in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor could lead to an improved antitumor immune response.",
      "detailedDescription": "This was a phase 2, open-label, randomized multicenter study conducted at 34 sites across the USA, Europe, and Australia. The study compared ADX combined with nivolumab (NIVO) versus NIVO alone in patients with recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma.\n\nEligible patients were randomized 1:1 via an interactive web response system to ADX+NIVO or NIVO alone. Stratification was based on PD-L1 status (≥1% vs <1% tumor cell staining). Patients randomized to NIVO alone received 3 mg/kg NIVO via intravenous infusion every 2 weeks. Patients randomized to ADX+NIVO received 800 mg ADX every 2 weeks administered prior to NIVO (3 mg/kg). Treatment continued for up to 2 years until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal.\n\nThe primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) by investigator assessment according to RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response, and the occurrence of adverse events. The study also conducted exploratory analyses on blood-based and tissue-based biomarkers, including PD-L1 expression, mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR), intratumoral CD8+ cell density, gene signatures (such as TGF-β fibrosis and EMT), and tumor mutation burden (TMB), to assess their association with treatment response and survival."
