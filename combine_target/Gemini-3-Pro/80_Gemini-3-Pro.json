      "briefSummary": "The JAVELIN DLBCL study was conducted to assess whether a combination of agents could augment and sustain the antitumor immunity of avelumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-arm study comprising a phase Ib and a planned phase III component.",
      "detailedDescription": "The JAVELIN DLBCL study (NCT02951156) investigated the safety and efficacy of avelumab in combination with various agents hypothesized to augment antitumor immunity in patients with R/R DLBCL. In the phase Ib component reported here, 29 adult patients were randomized 1:1:1 to three treatment arms: avelumab in combination with utomilumab (an immunoglobulin G2 4-1BB agonist) and rituximab (arm A); avelumab in combination with utomilumab and azacitidine (arm B); or avelumab in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (arm C). \n\nAvelumab 10 mg/kg was administered intravenously every 2 weeks. Doses for combination agents were selected based on previous safety results. The primary endpoints were dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and objective response (OR) as assessed by the investigator per Lugano Response Classification criteria. Secondary endpoints included PD-L1 expression levels, minimal residual disease (MRD), duration of response (DR), time to tumor response (TTR), disease control (DC), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. \n\nThe study was discontinued before the initiation of the phase III component due to insufficient antitumor activity observed in arms A and B, and the infeasibility of expanding arm C due to recruitment difficulties."
