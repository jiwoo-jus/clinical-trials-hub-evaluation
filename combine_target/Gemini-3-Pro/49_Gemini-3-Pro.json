      "briefSummary": "The current study investigated the influence of pairing an acute positive reinforcing dopaminergic/noradrenergic effect (methylphenidate, MPH) with a standard antidepressant on the rates of adherence to medication treatment. The primary objective was to determine whether MPH + escitalopram resulted in higher rates of medication adherence relative to placebo + escitalopram in individuals with moderate to severe depression.",
      "detailedDescription": "This Phase 2a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial included two principal study arms, with an option to escalate the dose of escitalopram at week 4. Participants were 1–1 randomized to either (1) 5 mg placebo + 10 mg escitalopram (encapsulated into one capsule) or (2) 5 mg methylphenidate (MPH) + 10 mg escitalopram (encapsulated into one capsule). Participants randomized to either condition were prescribed medication over the course of 8 weeks, with in-person follow-up visits at weeks 0, 2, 4 and 8, and follow-up phone calls on weeks 1, 3 and 6.\n\nThe pilot study was part of a two-stage design which aimed to enroll 100 subjects. However, the trial was terminated at the end of Stage 1 (n=20) due to the results showing the opposite direction to the hypothesis and low posterior probabilities that MPH is superior to the placebo. The primary endpoint for adherence was percent Pill count. The secondary endpoint for adherence was based on the Medication Electronic Monitoring System (MEMS). Exploratory endpoints included the Beliefs About Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) and changes in the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomology (QIDS-SR)."
