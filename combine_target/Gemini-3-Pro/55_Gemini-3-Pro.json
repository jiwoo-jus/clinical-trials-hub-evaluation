      "briefSummary": "This first-in-human, randomized, Phase 1 study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of GSK3358699 in healthy male participants. GSK3358699 is a mononuclear myeloid-targeted bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family inhibitor designed to minimize toxicities associated with pan-BET inhibitors. The study assessed single ascending doses and repeat doses to determine tolerability and the drug's ability to target specific immune cells.",
      "detailedDescription": "The study was conducted as a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind trial divided into parts to assess GSK3358699 in healthy males. Part A utilized a single ascending-dose crossover design involving three dose-escalating periods with doses ranging from 1 to 40 mg. Part C was a repeat-dose design where participants received 10 mg of GSK3358699 or placebo daily for up to 14 days. A planned Part B to evaluate food effects was not conducted.\n\nThe primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability, including adverse events, laboratory safety data, vital signs, cardiac telemetry, and ECGs. Secondary objectives included evaluating the systemic pharmacokinetic profile of GSK3358699 and its metabolite GSK3206944, the intracellular pharmacokinetic profile in monocytes, and pharmacodynamics as measured by the inhibition of cytokine production (MCP-1, IL-6, TNF) in blood following ex vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. The study utilized an esterase-sensitive motif (ESM) approach intended to deliver the active metabolite preferentially to mononuclear-myeloid cells expressing human carboxyesterase-1 (CES-1). The study was terminated early due to cardiac-related adverse events observed during the repeat-dosing phase."
