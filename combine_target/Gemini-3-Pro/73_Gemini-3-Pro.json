      "briefSummary": "This study (ORIENT-4) is a multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 clinical trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of sintilimab, a humanized anti-PD-1 antibody, in patients with relapsed or refractory extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma (r/r ENKTL). The study enrolled patients who had failed at least one prior asparaginase-based regimen. Participants received sintilimab intravenously every 3 weeks. The primary objective was to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) based on Lugano 2014 criteria.",
      "detailedDescription": "The ORIENT-4 trial is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 study investigating sintilimab monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma (r/r ENKTL). Eligible patients, aged 18 to 70 years with measurable lesions and adequate organ function, had previously failed asparaginase-based chemotherapy. Participants received sintilimab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 24 months. Treatment continued until disease progression, death, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent; however, treatment beyond initial progressive disease was allowed at the investigator's discretion to account for potential pseudo-progression.\n\nThe primary endpoint of the study was the objective response rate (ORR), defined as the sum of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) rates according to Lugano 2014 criteria. Secondary endpoints included the disease control rate (DCR), time to response (TTR), duration of response (DOR), 1-year overall survival (OS), safety, and quality of life measured by EQ-5D-5L and EORTC QLQ-C30. The study also focused on identifying and characterizing patterns of radiologic tumor pseudo-progression associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in this specific lymphoma subtype."
