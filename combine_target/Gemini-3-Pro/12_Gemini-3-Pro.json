      "briefSummary": "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of a 3-day course of remdesivir in high-risk, nonhospitalized patients with Covid-19. The investigators hypothesized that earlier initiation of a short course of remdesivir treatment in outpatient settings would reduce hospitalizations and mortality compared to placebo.",
      "detailedDescription": "The study enrolled patients 12 years of age or older who had at least one preexisting risk factor for progression to severe Covid-19 (including age ≥60 years, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, immune compromise, chronic kidney/liver/lung disease, cancer, or sickle cell disease). Eligible patients had at least one ongoing symptom consistent with Covid-19, with onset within 7 days before randomization, and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2 and 3) or placebo. Randomization was stratified by residence in a skilled nursing facility, age (<60 years or ≥60 years), and country. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of Covid-19–related hospitalization (defined as ≥24 hours of acute care) or death from any cause by day 28. Secondary end points included a composite of Covid-19–related medically attended visits or death by days 14 and 28, viral load changes, and time to symptom alleviation assessed via the FLU-PRO Plus questionnaire."
