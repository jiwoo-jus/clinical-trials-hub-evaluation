      "briefSummary": "This study evaluates the feasibility of a randomized trial for blood pressure intervention within a preoperative clinic setting. It compares two approaches for patients with elevated blood pressure: providing brief counseling and an educational brochure versus providing counseling, a brochure, and a home blood pressure monitor (HBPM). The study aims to assess the practicality of the protocol, including patient compliance with monitoring and the ability to obtain follow-up data, as well as to observe baseline rates of primary care follow-up and medication adjustments 60 days after surgery.",
      "detailedDescription": "Poorly controlled hypertension is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. This prospective randomized feasibility study was conducted at the Yale New Haven Hospital Preadmission Testing Clinic to assess the viability of incorporating hypertension screening and intervention into perioperative workflows. A cohort of 100 adult patients presenting with clinic-measured blood pressures in the hypertensive range (systolic ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic ≥ 90 mmHg) were recruited and randomized 1:1.\n\nOne group received standard brief counseling regarding hypertension and an educational pamphlet titled 'Your guide on lowering blood pressure.' The second group received the same counseling and pamphlet but was also fitted with a validated home blood pressure monitor (HBPM) and instructed to perform morning and evening measurements until the day of surgery. HBPM participants later received a mailed report of their home readings.\n\nThe study's endpoints focused on the feasibility of executing the protocol, measured by the return rate of HBPM devices and the success rate of 60-day post-operative follow-up via telephone and Electronic Health Record (EHR) tracking. Secondary outcomes included the rate of patient follow-up with primary care providers, the initiation or adjustment of hypertension medications, and participant satisfaction with the study interventions."
