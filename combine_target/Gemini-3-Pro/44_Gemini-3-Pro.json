      "briefSummary": "This three-arm parallel randomised controlled trial tests an adaptive intervention designed to improve medication adherence in patients with gout using habit formation theory. The study leverages the cue-reward-repetition principle, where participants link medication taking to a daily routine (cue) and receive a charitable donation (reward) for adherence. The goal is to transform medication-taking into an automatic habit to improve long-term adherence to urate-lowering therapy.",
      "detailedDescription": "Non-adherence to daily urate-lowering therapy (ULT) is a significant barrier to effective gout management. This pragmatic, prospective randomized controlled trial evaluates a habit formation intervention consisting of behavioral repetition, context cues, and rewards.\n\nParticipants are adult gout patients with elevated uric acid levels (>6 mg/dL) utilizing electronic pill bottles to track adherence. They are randomised into one of three arms:\n1. Arm 1 (Non-adaptive intervention): Participants select a specific daily cue to link with medication-taking. They receive a US$0.50 donation to a selected charity for every day of adherence. Text message reminders regarding the cue are sent if adherence falls below 75%.\n2. Arm 2 (Adaptive intervention): Participants start with a lower reward intensity (US$0.25 per adherent day) and no text reminders. If adherence is less than 75% at 6 weeks post-randomisation, the intervention intensifies to match Arm 1 (US$0.50 reward and text reminders).\n3. Arm 3 (Control): Participants use electronic pill bottles for monitoring but receive no habit formation intervention.\n\nThe study assesses the primary outcome of adherence to gout medications over an 18-week period. Secondary outcomes include changes in automaticity (Self-Report Behaviour Automaticity Index), routine integration, and intentions/perceptions of medication. Exploratory outcomes include changes in uric acid levels derived from electronic health records."
