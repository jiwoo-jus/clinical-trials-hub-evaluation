      "briefSummary": "The Communication and Education in Tumor Profiling (COMET) study evaluates the efficacy of a web-based genetic education intervention compared to usual care for patients with advanced cancer undergoing tumor-only genetic sequencing. The study aims to determine if the intervention increases genetic knowledge and decreases distress, specifically anxiety, depression, and cancer-specific distress, prior to the receipt of sequencing results.",
      "detailedDescription": "Precision oncology utilizes tumor genetic sequencing to identify targeted therapies, yet guidelines for pretest counseling in this context are lacking compared to germline testing. This randomized trial (EAQ152) assesses a theoretically informed, web-based genetic education intervention designed to enhance patient understanding and manage psychosocial outcomes.\n\nPatients with advanced cancer enrolled in the National Cancer Institute Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (NCI-MATCH) trial or undergoing site-based tumor sequencing were randomized to the web intervention or usual care. The intervention utilizes a tiered-binned model offering 'indispensable' core information and optional in-depth content regarding the differences between tumor and germline genetics, potential test results, and implications for treatment and family.\n\nPrimary endpoints include changes in genetic knowledge (measured by an adapted ClinSeq scale) and distress outcomes (general anxiety, depression, state anxiety, and cancer-specific distress) assessed at baseline, post-education, and post-result disclosure. Secondary objectives evaluate moderators such as health literacy, gender, and satisfaction with result disclosure."
