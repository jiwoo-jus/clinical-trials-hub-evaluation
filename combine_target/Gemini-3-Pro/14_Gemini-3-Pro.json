      "briefSummary": "Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has been proposed as a rescue therapy in critically ill COVID-19 patients. The aim of the present study was to determine whether combining TPE with convalescent plasma (CVP) transfusion early in the intensive care unit (ICU) stay improves survival among this heterogeneous population. The primary endpoint was survival at 30 days. Secondary endpoints included assessing the evolution of biomarkers, such as the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional inspired oxygen ratio, and C reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ferritin levels at the 7-day follow-up.",
      "detailedDescription": "This single centre, prospective, non-randomized controlled trial was conducted in an 8-bed COVID-19 ICU and included patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring intensive care treatment. A total of 38 Caucasian patients were included in the study, admitted between August 8, 2020, and January 9, 2021. All patients were adults (>18 years) presenting with acute respiratory failure and ARDS, with positive RT-PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nPatients were divided equally into two groups: a treatment group administered sequential TPE and CVP transfusion in addition to standard treatment, and a control group administered only standard treatment according to hospital protocols. In the treatment group, TPE was initiated during the first 24 hours after ICU admission using an Infomed HF 440 machine with a plasma/blood separation ratio of 20% and 40 ml/kg fresh frozen plasma as the substitute. This was followed immediately by transfusion of 500 ml of ABO compatible CVP. Standard treatment for both groups consisted of corticosteroids (dexamethasone), antiretrovirals (lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir), anticoagulants (nadroparine), and antibiotics if deemed necessary.\n\nOutcomes monitored were survival at 30 days, oxygenation (P/F ratio), and inflammatory markers (CRP, LDH, and ferritin) at the 7-day follow-up."
