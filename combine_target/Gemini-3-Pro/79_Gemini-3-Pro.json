      "briefSummary": "This study evaluated the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of fremanezumab for the preventive treatment of chronic or episodic migraine in Japanese patients. In a 52-week, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial, participants received subcutaneous fremanezumab either monthly or quarterly. The study monitored adverse events, including injection-site reactions, and assessed efficacy outcomes such as reductions in monthly migraine days and improvements in headache-related disability.",
      "detailedDescription": "This multicenter, randomized, open-label trial was designed to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of fremanezumab in Japanese patients with chronic migraine (CM) or episodic migraine (EM). The study consisted of a 4-week screening period, a 52-week treatment period, and a follow-up period. Newly enrolled patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous fremanezumab via a monthly or quarterly dosing regimen. The monthly regimen consisted of an initial dose (675 mg for CM, 225 mg for EM) followed by 225 mg monthly. The quarterly regimen consisted of 675 mg administered every 3 months. A subset of rollover patients from previous Phase IIb/III trials was also included for immunogenicity testing.\n\nThe primary objective was safety, assessed by monitoring treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), injection-site reactions (erythema, induration, pain), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiograms, and suicidality using the Electronic Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Immunogenicity was evaluated through the development of anti-drug antibodies (ADA).\n\nEfficacy outcomes included changes from baseline in average monthly migraine days, headache days of at least moderate severity, headache days of any severity, and days using acute headache medication. Disability and impact were measured using the 6-Item Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) for CM patients and the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) for EM patients. The study aimed to confirm if the safety and efficacy profiles observed in global trials were consistent in the Japanese population over a 12-month period."
