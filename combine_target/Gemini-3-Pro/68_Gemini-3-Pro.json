      "briefSummary": "The aim of this randomized, double-blind trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability profile, including cardiac safety, of sugammadex-mediated recovery from neuromuscular block in participants undergoing surgery who met the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Class 3 or 4 criteria. Specifically, this study assessed the impact of sugammadex on cardiac adverse events (AEs) and other prespecified AEs of clinical interest compared to neostigmine/glycopyrrolate.",
      "detailedDescription": "Participants meeting ASA Class 3 and 4 criteria were stratified by ASA Class and NMBA (rocuronium or vecuronium) then randomized to one of the following: 1) Moderate neuromuscular block, sugammadex 2 mg/kg; 2) Moderate neuromuscular block, neostigmine and glycopyrrolate (neostigmine/glycopyrrolate); 3) Deep neuromuscular block, sugammadex 4 mg/kg; 4) Deep neuromuscular block, sugammadex 16 mg/kg (rocuronium only). Primary endpoints included incidences of treatment-emergent (TE) sinus bradycardia, TE sinus tachycardia and other TE cardiac arrhythmias. Continuous electrocardiogram monitoring began ≥5 min before study medication administration and lasted ≥30 min after study medication administration. Events of clinical interest (ECI) included clinically relevant (CR) sinus bradycardia, CR sinus tachycardia, other CR cardiac arrhythmias, drug-induced liver injury, and adjudicated hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis."
