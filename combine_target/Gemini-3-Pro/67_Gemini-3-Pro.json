      "briefSummary": "This first-in-human clinical trial investigates M5717, a novel plasmodium translation elongation factor 2 inhibitor, as a potential antimalarial treatment. The study aims to characterize the safety, pharmacokinetics, and antimalarial activity of M5717 in healthy volunteers. The trial consists of two parts: a randomized, placebo-controlled single ascending dose study to assess safety across escalating doses, and a volunteer infection study using the Plasmodium falciparum induced blood-stage malaria model to evaluate the drug's efficacy in clearing parasites.",
      "detailedDescription": "The study was designed as a two-part, single-center clinical trial. Part one was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose (SAD) study. Participants were enrolled into one of nine dose cohorts (50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 1000, 1250, 1800, or 2100 mg) and randomly assigned (3:1) to receive a single oral dose of M5717 or placebo. A sentinel dosing strategy was utilized for each cohort. Part two was an open-label, non-randomized volunteer infection study (VIS) utilizing the Plasmodium falciparum induced blood-stage malaria model. Healthy, malaria-naive participants were inoculated intravenously with P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes. Upon developing parasitaemia, participants were enrolled into three dose cohorts (150, 400, and 800 mg) to receive M5717. Primary outcomes included safety and tolerability (frequency and severity of adverse events) for the SAD study, and pharmacokinetic profiles and parasite clearance kinetics (parasite reduction ratio and clearance half-life) for the VIS. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of recrudescence and exploratory analysis of genetic mutations in recrudescent parasites."
