      "briefSummary": "CASTING (NCT02861014) was a prospective, international, multicenter, single-arm, open-label phase 3b trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) who demonstrated a suboptimal response to one or two prior disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). The primary objective was to evaluate the proportion of patients achieving \"no evidence of disease activity\" (NEDA), incorporating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) re-baselining at Week 8, over a 96-week treatment period.",
      "detailedDescription": "The study enrolled patients aged 18–55 years diagnosed with RRMS according to the McDonald 2010 criteria, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 0.0–4.0 and disease duration under 10 years. Participants must have had a suboptimal response to one or two prior DMTs, defined as the occurrence of one or more clinically reported relapses, one or more T1-weighted contrast-enhancing lesions (CELs), or two or more new/enlarging T2-weighted hyperintense lesions while on a stable dose of DMT for at least 6 months.\n\nEligible patients received intravenous ocrelizumab 600 mg every 24 weeks for 96 weeks, with the first dose administered as two 300-mg infusions 14 days apart. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with NEDA over 96 weeks. NEDA was defined as the absence of protocol-defined relapses, 24-week confirmed disability progression (CDP), T1-weighted CELs, and new and/or enlarging T2-weighted hyperintense lesions. MRI re-baselining occurred at Week 8 to exclude activity occurring before the full therapeutic effect of ocrelizumab was established.\n\nSecondary endpoints included NEDA proportions at Weeks 24 and 48, time to first event of disease activity, annualized relapse rate (ARR), mean change in EDSS score, and brain volume changes (whole-brain, white matter, and cortical gray matter). Safety assessments monitored adverse events, serious adverse events, and laboratory parameters throughout the study."
