      "briefSummary": "The aim of this multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was to investigate the safety and efficacy of the anxiolytic drug Tenoten in the treatment of anxiety in adults. The study focused on patients suffering from somatoform dysfunction (SfD), reaction to severe stress (RSS), adjustment disorders (AjD), and other neurotic disorders (oNDs). Participants were randomized to receive either Tenoten (at two different dosage levels) or a placebo over a 12-week period to assess improvements in anxiety symptoms.",
      "detailedDescription": "The study enrolled 390 adult outpatients (aged 18–45 years) with anxiety scores ≥ 11 on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale-anxiety (HADS-A). Participants were diagnosed with SfD (ICD-10 codes F45.0, F45.1, F45.2, F45.4, F45.8, F45.9), RSS and AjD (F43.0, F43.1, F43.2, F43.8, F43.9), or other neurotic disorders (F48.8, F48.9). Patients were randomized into four groups: Tenoten group 1 (4 tablets/day), Tenoten group 3 (8 tablets/day), and Placebo groups 2 and 4 (combined for analysis). The treatment period lasted for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in the mean Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) score after 12 weeks. Exploratory outcomes included changes in HAM-A scores at 4 and 8 weeks, the percentage of responders (≥ 50% reduction on HAM-A), the percentage of patients achieving remission (HAM-A < 14), changes in EQ-5D-3L quality of life scores, and the Clinical Global Impression-Efficacy Index (CGI-EI). Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events throughout the study."
