      "briefSummary": "Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is an effective treatment for obesity but is associated with rapid weight loss that adversely affects bone metabolism, predisposing patients to skeletal fragility. This study is a 9-month, pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating the efficacy of a one-time infusion of zoledronic acid compared to placebo in combating SG-associated bone loss. Thirty adult SG patients will be randomized to receive either 5 mg of zoledronic acid or placebo 6 weeks following surgery, with the primary goal of assessing changes in areal bone mineral density (aBMD) at the total hip.",
      "detailedDescription": "This research protocol outlines a comprehensive, quadruple-blinded, randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the use of zoledronic acid to prevent bone loss following sleeve gastrectomy (SG). The study aims to determine efficacy and evaluate feasibility. Thirty adult participants meeting eligibility criteria (including weight <350 lbs, adequate baseline calcium/vitamin D, and absence of bone-impacting pathologies) will be enrolled. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive a one-time 100 mL infusion of 5 mg zoledronic acid or saline placebo 6–8 weeks post-surgery. \n\nSpecific Aim 1 focuses on efficacy. The primary outcome is the change in areal bone mineral density (aBMD) at the total hip measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at 9 months compared to baseline. Secondary outcomes include change in aBMD of the femoral neck and lumbar spine, change in volumetric BMD and bone strength at the lumbar spine measured by quantitative CT (QCT) and finite element analysis, and changes in serum bone turnover markers (P1NP and NTX). \n\nSpecific Aim 2 assesses feasibility by documenting adverse events, side effects, and compliance rates. All participants will receive standardized nutritional supplementation (1200 mg calcium daily and vitamin D based on serum levels) throughout the study. Assessments include physical function testing, body composition analysis, and validated surveys."
