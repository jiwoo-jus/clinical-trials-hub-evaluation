      "briefSummary": "In this pilot trial, the role of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) in both healthy subjects and patients with chronic venous disease (CVD) has been evaluated. The study investigated the effect of bilateral leg NMES on the symptoms of CVD, testing the hypothesis that repeated NMES use will enhance venous haemodynamic parameters, improve clinician disease scores, and increase patient-reported quality of life.",
      "detailedDescription": "Forty subjects were recruited from four groups: healthy, superficial insufficiency, deep insufficiency, and deep obstruction. The NMES device used was the geko™ T-1, applied transcutaneously to the common peroneal nerve at the knee to cause contractions of the anterior and lateral compartments of the leg. Devices were fitted bilaterally and worn for 4–6 hours, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks.\n\nHaemodynamic venous measurements were taken from the right femoral vein with ultrasound (measuring peak velocity, time averaged mean velocity, and volume flow) and laser Doppler fluximetry from the left hand and foot. Leg volume was calculated using ankle and calf diameters. Measurements were taken at baseline, during device activation (20 minutes after turn on), and repeated at week 6. Physician- and patient-reported quality of life assessments (Venous Clinical Severity Score, Venous Disability Score, Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire, EuroQol-5D, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Short Form-12) were performed at weeks 0, 6, and 8."
