      "briefSummary": "This phase 3 trial evaluated the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of sequential administration of either V114 (a 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) or PCV13, followed 6 months later by PPSV23, in immunocompetent adults aged 18–49 years with or without predefined risk factors for pneumococcal disease. Overall, 1515 participants were randomized 3:1 to receive either V114 or PCV13, followed by PPSV23.",
      "detailedDescription": "This was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled study (protocol V114-017) conducted at 79 sites worldwide. The study aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V114 in pneumococcal vaccine-naive immunocompetent adults aged 18–49 years with or without risk factors for pneumococcal disease (PD). Participants were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive a single dose of V114 or PCV13 on Day 1, followed by a single dose of PPSV23 at Month 6. V114 contains pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide from serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23F, 22F, and 33F, and serotype 6B. PCV13 contains serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F, and serotype 6B. PPSV23 contains 23 serotypes. Safety endpoints included solicited injection-site and systemic adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). Immunogenicity was assessed by measuring serotype-specific opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) geometric mean titers (GMTs) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) at Day 30, Month 6, and Month 7."
