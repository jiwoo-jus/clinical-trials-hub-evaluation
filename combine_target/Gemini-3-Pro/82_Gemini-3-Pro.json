      "briefSummary": "HIV counselling and testing are essential to control the HIV epidemic, yet uptake remains low in sub-Saharan Africa where many utilize traditional healers. This study hypothesized that uptake of HIV tests would increase if provided by traditional healers. The aim was to determine the effectiveness of traditional healers delivering HIV testing at point of care compared with referral to local clinics for HIV testing in rural southwestern Uganda.",
      "detailedDescription": "This mixed-methods study included a cluster-randomised trial followed by individual qualitative interviews among a sample of participants in Mbarara, Uganda. Traditional healers aged 18 years or older were randomly assigned (1:1) as clusters to an intervention or a control group. Healers screened their clients for eligibility, and research assistants confirmed eligibility and enrolled clients who were aged 18 years or older, were receiving care from a participating healer, were sexually active, and self-reported not having received an HIV test in the previous 12 months. Intervention group healers provided counselling and offered point-of-care HIV tests to adult clients using oral swab kits. Control group healers provided referral for HIV testing at nearby clinics. The primary outcome was the individual receipt of an HIV test within 90 days of study enrolment. Secondary outcomes included new HIV diagnoses and linkage to HIV care."
