      "briefSummary": "This study investigated a combination approach to increase HIV testing in male partners of HIV-positive and HIV-negative pregnant women in Lusaka, Zambia. Two parallel, unmasked randomized trials were conducted. The control groups received partner notification services only, while the intervention groups received partner notification services plus targeted education and the provision of oral HIV self-test kits. The primary objective was to assess reported male partner testing at a health facility within 30 days, with a secondary objective of assessing male partner HIV testing of any kind.",
      "detailedDescription": "Background:\nTesting men for HIV during their partner’s pregnancy can guide couples-based HIV prevention and treatment, but testing rates remain low. This study evaluates a combination approach using evidence-based strategies—specifically partner notification and HIV self-testing—to increase HIV testing uptake among male partners.\n\nMethods:\nThe researchers conducted two parallel, unmasked randomized trials at the Chipata Level 1 Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia. Trial 1 enrolled pregnant women with a documented HIV-positive test result, and Trial 2 enrolled pregnant women with a documented HIV-negative test result. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either a control or an intervention group.\n\nIntervention vs. Control:\n- Control Group: Received partner notification services only. This included options for client self-referral, provider contract referral, provider referral, and dual referral. The counseling was adapted for HIV-negative women in Trial 2.\n- Intervention Group: Received the same partner notification services as the control group, plus targeted education on the use of oral HIV self-test kits and provision of up to five oral HIV self-test kits (OraQuick) for their partners and themselves.\n\nOutcomes:\nThe primary outcome was reported male partner testing at a health facility within 30 days following randomization. This outcome emphasizes the importance of engagement with HIV services by trained personnel. A prespecified secondary outcome was male partner HIV testing of any kind (including self-testing at home) within 30 days. Information was collected via participant self-report at a 30-day follow-up visit."
