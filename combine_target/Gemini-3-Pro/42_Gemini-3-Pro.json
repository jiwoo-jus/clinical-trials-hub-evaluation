      "briefSummary": "This open-label, single-arm, Phase IV study assessed the safety and efficacy of the FLECTOR diclofenac epolamine topical system (FDETS) in a pediatric population (aged 6–16 years) with clinically significant minor soft tissue injuries. The study aimed to confirm the safety profile, local tolerability, and analgesic efficacy of this topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) formulation in children, comparing the results with previous data obtained in adults. The primary focus was on local tolerability and systemic safety, with secondary assessments on pharmacokinetics and pain reduction.",
      "detailedDescription": "The study was conducted at ten family medicine or pediatric practices in the USA involving children aged 6–16 years who sustained a clinically significant minor soft tissue injury within the preceding 96 hours and exhibited at least moderate spontaneous pain (score of >= 3 on the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale). This was an open-label, single-arm, non-randomized trial designed to meet FDA requirements for pediatric safety and efficacy confirmation.\n\nParticipants applied the FLECTOR topical system, containing 180 mg of diclofenac epolamine, to the injury site twice daily until pain resolution or for a maximum of 14 days. The primary endpoint was local tolerability and systemic safety. Local tolerability was evaluated using a seven-item scale ranging from no skin changes to redness with extension beyond the contact site. Adverse events were categorized using MedDRA codes.\n\nKey secondary endpoints included diclofenac plasma concentrations and analgesic efficacy. Blood samples were collected 24 hours after the first application and at the final visit to assess pharmacokinetics using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometry detection. Analgesic efficacy was self-assessed by patients using the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale in daily diaries and during clinic visits on Days 2, 4, 7, and 14. Investigators also assessed the global response to therapy. Data were stratified by age group (6–11 years and 12–16 years) and compared with historical data from adult studies."
