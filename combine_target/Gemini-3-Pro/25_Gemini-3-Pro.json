      "briefSummary": "This report presents the interim safety and immunogenicity findings from an ongoing phase 1/2 study of the BNT162b2 vaccine in healthy Japanese adults. The study involves 160 participants randomized to receive either the vaccine or a placebo. The findings indicate that the vaccine is safe and produces a robust immune response in the Japanese population.",
      "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind phase 1/2 study assessing the safety and immunogenicity of BNT162b2 in healthy Japanese adults aged 20–85 years. Participants were randomized 3:1 to receive two intramuscular injections of 30 μg BNT162b2 or placebo, administered 21 days apart. The study population included 160 individuals: 119 received the vaccine and 41 received the placebo. Participants were stratified into two age groups: 20–64 years and 65–85 years. The primary safety objectives focused on local reactions, systemic events, and adverse events. The primary immunogenicity objectives measured SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs) and geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) one month after the second dose. The results show acceptable safety profiles with generally mild to moderate reactions and robust antibody induction regardless of age."
