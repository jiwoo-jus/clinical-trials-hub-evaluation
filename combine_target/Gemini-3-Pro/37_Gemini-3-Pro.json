      "briefSummary": "The REinforcement learning to Improve Non-adherence For diabetes treatments by Optimising Response and Customising Engagement (REINFORCE) trial is a randomized study aimed at testing the impact of a reinforcement learning-based text messaging programme on medication adherence for patients with type 2 diabetes. The study compares an intervention group receiving personalized text messages adapted by machine learning algorithms against a control group, with both groups using electronic pill bottles to measure adherence over a 6-month period.",
      "detailedDescription": "The REINFORCE trial is a two-arm pragmatic randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of a text messaging programme tailored using reinforcement learning on medication adherence. The study enrolls 60 patients with suboptimal diabetes control (HbA1c ≥7.5%) treated with 1–3 daily oral diabetes medications. Subjects are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either an intervention or control arm. Participants in both arms utilize electronic pill bottles to track medication usage. \n\nThe intervention arm receives up to daily text messages that are individually adapted using a reinforcement learning prediction algorithm based on daily adherence measurements derived from the pill bottles. The algorithm utilizes a contextual bandit method to optimize message content based on five factors: framing (neutral, positive, or negative), observed feedback, social reinforcement, nature of content (reminder vs. information), and reflection. The primary outcome is average adherence to medication over the 6-month follow-up period. Secondary outcomes include changes in glycemic control (measured by HbA1c) and self-reported adherence. The study aims to demonstrate how personalized communication can be scaled to support self-management interventions."
