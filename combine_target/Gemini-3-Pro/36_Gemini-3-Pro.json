      "briefSummary": "The present study examines patterns of weight loss among overweight and obese women who demonstrated early robust response to twice daily exenatide treatment compared to those treated with hypocaloric diet and matched placebo injections. The primary outcome was long-term change in body weight among early high responders to either treatment. An exploratory metabolomic analysis was also performed to identify physiologic predictors of response.",
      "detailedDescription": "This 52-week single-blind interventional trial randomized 182 women (BMI 25-48 kg/m2) to treatment with either exenatide alone (titrated to maximum dosing of 10mcg twice daily) or matched placebo injections plus a hypocaloric diet (500 kcal/day reduction based on measured resting metabolic rate). There was no run-in period. At 12 weeks, subjects in both groups who demonstrated ≥ 5% weight loss were characterized as high responders and continued participating in the study for up to 52 weeks. Those who did not achieve 5% weight loss were categorized as low responders and their participation ended. Participants who lost ≥10% body weight at any point were classified as \"super responders.\"\n\nBody weight, waist circumference, vital signs, and body composition (via bioelectrical impedance analysis) were assessed at each visit. Comprehensive metabolic visits occurred at weeks 0, 12, 24, and 52, including blood draws for hematology, electrolyte, and lipid panels, measurement of resting metabolic rate using indirect calorimetry, and assessment of the thermic effect of food via a liquid meal tolerance test. Additionally, a targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method measuring ~150 known metabolites was utilized in an exploratory analysis to identify metabolites associated with treatment response."
