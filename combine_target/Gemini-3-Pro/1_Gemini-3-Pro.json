      "briefSummary": "This Phase 4 randomized controlled trial investigates the myocardial effects of carbetocin compared with oxytocin in healthy women undergoing planned caesarean delivery. Both drugs are oxytocin receptor agonists used to prevent uterine atony and postpartum haemorrhage. While oxytocin is known to cause dose-dependent cardiac effects such as troponin release, less is known about carbetocin. The study aims to determine if carbetocin causes similar changes to myocardial markers.",
      "detailedDescription": "The study is a parallel-group, randomized, patient- and investigator-blinded Phase 4 trial conducted at Oslo University Hospital and Akershus University Hospital, Norway. The trial will enroll 240 healthy, singleton pregnant women aged 18 to 50 years undergoing planned caesarean delivery. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive a one-minute intravenous injection of either oxytocin 2.5 IU or carbetocin 100 µg immediately after delivery. The primary outcome is the change from baseline in high-sensitive troponin I plasma concentrations measured 6–10 hours after study drug administration. Secondary outcomes include uterine tone grade at 2.5 and 5 minutes, adverse events for up to 48 hours, estimated blood loss, need for rescue treatment, and direct/indirect costs. A sub-study will also investigate postoperative pain. The study aims to inform treatment decisions regarding uterotonic agents by assessing potential cardiotoxicity differences."
