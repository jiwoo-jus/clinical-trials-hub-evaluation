      "briefSummary": "This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of JTA-004, a new enhanced protein solution containing clonidine, hyaluronic acid, and human plasma, for the treatment of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. The trial consists of two stages: first, to select the most effective among three formulations of JTA-004, and second, to compare the selected formulation's safety and efficacy against a reference hyaluronic acid treatment (hylan G-F 20) in delaying joint replacement surgery.",
      "detailedDescription": "This is a two-stage, prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled phase II/III study conducted in 12 Belgian centers involving patients aged 50–79 diagnosed with primary knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade II or III). In the first stage, participants were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive a single intra-articular injection of one of three JTA-004 formulations (differing in clonidine concentration [50 or 100 μg/ml] and volume [2 or 4 ml]) or a reference treatment (hylan G-F 20). Based on interim results, the formulation containing 200 μg clonidine and 20 mg hyaluronic acid in 2 ml (JTA-200/2) was selected. The second stage compared the selected JTA-200/2 formulation with the reference treatment regarding safety and efficacy up to 6 months post-injection. Efficacy was evaluated using Western Ontario McMaster Universities (WOMAC) Scores (Pain, Stiffness, and Physical Function subscales) and the Short-Form (SF-12) health survey. Safety assessments included adverse event monitoring, laboratory results, and physical examinations."
