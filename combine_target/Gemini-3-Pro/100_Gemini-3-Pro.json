      "briefSummary": "This phase I/IIa study assesses the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of BMS-986148, a mesothelin-directed antibody–drug conjugate (ADC), administered as a monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab. The trial targets patients with selected advanced solid tumors, including mesothelioma, ovarian, pancreatic, gastric, and non–small cell lung cancers.",
      "detailedDescription": "CA008-002 is an open-label, international, multicohort phase I/IIa trial investigating the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of BMS-986148 alone or in combination with the anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab. The study includes dose-escalation, dose-exploration, and dose-expansion phases involving patients with advanced (metastatic, recurrent, refractory, and/or unresectable) solid tumors of selected histologies: pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, or non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nIn the dose-escalation phase, patients received BMS-986148 monotherapy intravenously either every 3 weeks (Part 1A) or once weekly for 3 weeks followed by 1 week off (Part 1B), or BMS-986148 combined with nivolumab every 3 weeks (Part 3A). Doses were escalated to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose. The primary endpoints are safety, tolerability, and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). \n\nDuring the dose-expansion phase (Parts 2 and 3B), patients with specific tumor types and confirmed high mesothelin expression (H-score ≥ 100) were treated at the recommended dose levels. Secondary objectives include the assessment of pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and preliminary clinical activity evaluated via RECIST v1.1 (or modified RECIST for mesothelioma)."
