      "briefSummary": "FLAIR is a phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of AZD5718 in patients with proteinuric chronic kidney disease (CKD), with or without type 2 diabetes. AZD5718 is a selective 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) inhibitor that suppresses leukotriene production. The study assesses whether AZD5718 reduces albuminuria compared to placebo, both alone and when combined with dapagliflozin.",
      "detailedDescription": "The study aims to evaluate the dose–response effect of AZD5718. Participants are randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive oral AZD5718 at 3 different doses or matching placebo tablets once daily for 12 weeks (first treatment period). This is followed by an 8-week extension (second treatment period) during which all participants receive dapagliflozin (10 mg/d) in addition to their assigned study drug (AZD5718 or placebo), representing an anticipated future standard of care. The primary efficacy objective is to evaluate the dose–response effect of AZD5718 plus dapagliflozin on the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) after 20 weeks compared with placebo. Key secondary objectives include the dose–response effect of AZD5718 plus current standard of care on UACR at 12 weeks and acute effects on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Exploratory objectives include assessing biomarkers of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway (e.g., leukotriene E4) and potential effects on diabetic retinopathy."
