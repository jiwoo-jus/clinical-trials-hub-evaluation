      "briefSummary": "This study employs a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design to evaluate \"weWomen Plus,\" an adaptive, trauma-informed, culturally tailored technology-delivered intervention for immigrant women who have experienced Intimate Partner Violence (IPV). In the first stage, participants are randomized to an online safety decision and planning tool (culturally adapted myPlan app) or a usual care control arm. Women who do not report significant improvements in safety and empowerment at the 3-month follow-up (non-responders) are re-randomized to receive either supportive text messaging alone or a combination of text messaging and phone calls with trained advocates. The study hypothesizes that adding text and phone interventions will improve outcomes for non-responders regarding safety, mental health, and empowerment.",
      "detailedDescription": "The weWomen Plus study utilizes a SMART design to optimize an intervention protocol for immigrant women survivors of IPV. The study recruits foreign-born immigrant women in the US aged 18-64 who have experienced IPV in the past 12 months.\n\nPhase 1 Intervention:\nParticipants are randomized to either the weWomen Plus online/web-based component or a control group. The intervention group utilizes a culturally adapted version of the \"myPlan\" app. This evidence-based tool assists users in assessing the severity of violence using the Danger Assessment (DA), identifying safety priorities, and generating a tailored safety plan with links to resources. The control group receives usual safety planning resources modeled on national and state domestic violence online resources.\n\nPhase 2 Adaptive Intervention:\nOutcomes are assessed at 3 months post-baseline. Participants defined as \"non-responders\" (those showing no significant reduction in IPV severity/frequency or improvement in empowerment) in both the initial intervention and control arms are re-randomized to one of two augmented intervention arms:\n1. Text Messaging Intervention: Tailored weekly messages sent for 4 weeks. Content is based on an empowerment framework and psychosocial readiness model, covering safety awareness, risk assessment, barrier identification, and self-care.\n2. Text + Phone Intervention: In addition to the text regimen, participants receive two phone sessions with trained facilitators. These sessions utilize motivational enhancement and solution-focused techniques to build rapport, identify strengths, and develop attainable safety goals.\n\nParticipants identified as responders continue in their originally assigned arms. Assessments of safety, mental health (depression and PTSD), and empowerment occur at 3, 6, and 12 months post-baseline. The study aims to identify predictors of response and determine the relative effectiveness of the adaptive components for improving safety and health outcomes."
