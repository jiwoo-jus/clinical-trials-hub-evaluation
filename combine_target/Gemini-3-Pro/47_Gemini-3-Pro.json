      "briefSummary": "High rates of restricted community participation have been reported in young children with developmental disabilities. This study evaluates the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial of Occupational Performance Coaching (OPC) in Hong Kong. It also tests the initial efficacy of OPC, compared to parent consultation, in promoting children's community participation.",
      "detailedDescription": "A feasibility and pilot double-blind randomized controlled trial will be undertaken involving fifty children aged 6 years or below with developmental disabilities (DD) and their parents in Hong Kong. Participants will be recruited from early intervention centers and through social media. Parents will be randomly assigned to receive either Occupational Performance Coaching (OPC) or parent consultation and will be blinded to group allocation.\n\nThe OPC intervention focuses on coaching parents to facilitate their children's participation in life situations, grounded in self-determination theory. It involves specific techniques to heighten parents' engagement in an action-reflection process. The control group receives consultation regarding community resources and generic supportive strategies.\n\nOutcomes will be assessed by blinded assessors at baseline, pre-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up. Primary efficacy measures include the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) and the Young Children's Participation and Environment Measure (YC-PEM). Secondary outcomes include the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale (PSOC), Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21), and the Kiddy-KINDL Questionnaire. Predetermined success criteria will be used to assess the feasibility of the trial regarding recruitment, retention, adherence, blinding success, and fidelity. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with parents to explore the acceptability and perceived impact of OPC."
