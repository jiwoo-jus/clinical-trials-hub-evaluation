      "briefSummary": "This study employs mathematical modeling based on data from a Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT02313272) to evaluate a novel intermittent radiation treatment (iRT) strategy for recurrent high-grade glioma. By comparing iRT against standard hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HFSRT), the study aims to determine if intermittent dosing can prolong time to tumor progression by managing evolutionary dynamics of treatment resistance.",
      "detailedDescription": "Recurrent high-grade glioma (rHGG) patients often face poor prognoses with limited treatment options. This study utilizes a mathematical framework to simulate and compare treatment outcomes between standard Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy (HFSRT) and a proposed intermittent Radiation Treatment (iRT) schedule. \n\nThe model was calibrated using tumor growth curves from 16 patients treated with HFSRT, bevacizumab, and pembrolizumab in the NCT02313272 trial. The study simulates iRT delivered every 6 weeks, with an optional boost upon progression, to assess if maintaining a sensitive tumor subpopulation can slow the expansion of resistant clones. The results analyze time to progression and the potential for personalized treatment adaptations, suggesting that iRT plus boost is equal or superior to HFSRT in the majority of simulated cases."
