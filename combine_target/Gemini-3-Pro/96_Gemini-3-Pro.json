      "briefSummary": "The objective of this study was to evaluate if a financial incentive combined with a loss aversion component—a \"regret lottery\" in which veterans could win money if they met a set goal or told how much they could have won had they met their goal—would increase physical activity levels among veterans with chronic pain. Behavioral economic strategies can improve physical activity levels but have been undertested in veterans with chronic pain, a population with high rates of daily opioid use.",
      "detailedDescription": "A 12-week single-blinded randomized controlled trial was designed to assess the efficacy of a regret lottery intervention. Veterans with chronic pain (N = 40) receiving care at a specialty pain clinic were eligible for participation and were randomly assigned (1:1) to either (a) activity trackers and daily text message reminders to increase physical activity (\"control arm\"), or (b) the same plus a weekly regret lottery (\"intervention arm\"). For those in the intervention arm, participants who met their activity goal had a chance to win a small ($30) or large ($100) gift card incentive; those who did not meet their goals were informed of what they would have won had they met their goal. \n\nThe primary outcome, physical activity, was measured using self-reported physical activity (Stanford 7-Day Physical Activity Recall Questionnaire) and step counts using Fitbit activity trackers. Secondary outcomes included changes in physical function, chronic pain severity, depression (PHQ-9), and opioid use. The study aimed to determine if leveraging behavioral economic principles of immediate gratification and loss aversion could successfully promote physical activity in this population."
