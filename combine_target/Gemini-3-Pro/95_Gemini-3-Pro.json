      "briefSummary": "Project MIMIC (Maximizing Implementation of Motivational Incentives in Clinics) is a cluster-randomized, type 3 hybrid trial funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The study aims to identify effective strategies for helping opioid treatment programs improve the implementation of Contingency Management (CM) as an adjunct to medication for opioid use disorder. It compares the standard Addiction Technology Transfer Center (ATTC) Network implementation strategy against an enhanced ATTC strategy that includes additional theory-driven elements like Pay-for-Performance and Implementation & Sustainment Facilitation.",
      "detailedDescription": "Background:\nOpioid-related overdoses represent a public health emergency, necessitating evidence-based treatments like Contingency Management (CM). Despite its efficacy when combined with medication for opioid use disorder, CM implementation in opioid treatment programs is limited. Project MIMIC utilizes the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) model to guide the study.\n\nMethods:\nThe study employs a 3-cohort, cluster-randomized, type 3 hybrid design with opioid treatment programs as the unit of randomization. Thirty programs are randomized to one of two conditions:\n1. Control Condition: The Addiction Technology Transfer Center (ATTC) Network implementation strategy, consisting of didactic training, performance feedback, and on-going consultation.\n2. Experimental Condition: An enhanced ATTC strategy, comprising the core ATTC elements plus Pay-for-Performance (targeting staff's extrinsic motivations) and Implementation & Sustainment Facilitation (targeting staff's intrinsic motivations).\n\nObjectives:\n- Specific Aim 1 (Primary): Compare the effectiveness of the two strategies on implementation outcomes, specifically CM Exposure (number of sessions delivered), CM Skill (fidelity ratings), and CM Sustainment (delivery after support removal).\n- Specific Aim 2 (Secondary): Compare the effectiveness on patient outcomes, including self-reported opioid abstinence and opioid-related problems assessed at 3- and 6-months post-baseline.\n- Specific Aim 3 (Exploratory): Evaluate putative mediators of implementation effectiveness, such as implementation climate and leadership engagement.\n\nIntervention:\nThe prize-based CM intervention targets attendance and verified clinical encounters. Patients earn prize draws weekly for meeting attendance targets, with draws increasing for consecutive weeks of success."
