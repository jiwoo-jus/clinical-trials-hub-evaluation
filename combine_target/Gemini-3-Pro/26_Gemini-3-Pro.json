      "briefSummary": "The ChLorhexidine effect In the oral and lung MicroBiota study (CLIMB) aims to determine the effect of twice-daily chlorhexidine oral rinses on oral and lung microbiota biomass and respiratory symptoms in participants with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The study hypothesizes that because the oral microbiota is a main source of lung microbiota, treating the oral cavity with an antiseptic may alter the lung microbiota and subsequently improve COPD-related symptoms.",
      "detailedDescription": "This single-center, randomized, blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group preliminary study investigates the effects of chlorhexidine oral rinses on COPD outcomes. Participants aged 40–85 with a diagnosis of COPD and chronic productive cough or COPD exacerbation within the last year were randomized 1:1 to receive either 15 mL of twice-daily 0.12% chlorhexidine oral rinses or matched placebo for 8 weeks.\n\nParticipants provided medical history, performed spirometry, and completed the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and daily Breathlessness, Cough and Sputum Scale (BCSS) diaries. Biological samples, including blood, oral rinse, and induced sputum, were collected at randomization and at the final visit (8 weeks later). \n\nThe primary outcome measure was the change in oral and sputum microbiota biomass assessed by 16S rRNA quantification. Secondary outcomes included changes in sputum and oral microbiota biodiversity (Shannon and Simpson indices) and taxonomy; systemic inflammatory markers (white cell count, fibrinogen, and C reactive protein); and health-related quality of life scores (BCSS and SGRQ)."
