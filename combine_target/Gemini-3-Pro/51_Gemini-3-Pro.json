      "briefSummary": "This study investigates the safety and dosing of the ErbB inhibitor afatinib when administered in combination with radiotherapy (RT), with or without temozolomide (TMZ), in patients with newly diagnosed Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). GBM is a common malignant brain tumor often characterized by the amplification or overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. The hypothesis is that adding afatinib to standard RT and TMZ treatments may improve tumor responses or delay resistance. The primary goal is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of continuous daily afatinib within these combination regimens.",
      "detailedDescription": "This was a Phase I, open-label, 3 + 3 dose-escalation trial designed to define the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of afatinib in combination with radiotherapy (RT) and/or temozolomide (TMZ). The study enrolled patients aged 18 to under 70 years with newly-diagnosed, histologically-confirmed World Health Organization grade 4 malignant glioma and proven O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter methylation status.\n\nThe study utilized two treatment regimens based on MGMT status:\n1. Regimen M (Methylated MGMT): Afatinib + TMZ + RT.\n2. Regimen U (Unmethylated MGMT): Afatinib + RT.\n\nRadiotherapy was administered at a dose of 2 Gy per fraction, 5 days per week for 6 weeks (total 60 Gy). Afatinib was administered in dose-escalation cohorts of 20, 30, and 40 mg/day (single oral dose) during the RT phase (Days 1–42), and then at 40 mg/day following RT until disease progression or undue adverse reaction. In Regimen M, TMZ was administered at 75 mg/m2 daily during the RT phase, followed by a 4-week break, and then a maintenance phase for up to six 28-day cycles.\n\nThe primary endpoint was the MTD of continuous daily afatinib during the RT phase, defined as the highest dose where no more than one of six patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Secondary endpoints included the incidence and intensity of adverse events, objective tumor response rate assessed by Macdonald criteria, and pharmacokinetics of afatinib."
