      "briefSummary": "Uncontrolled hypertension is prevalent among African Americans, often leading to significant health disparities. While peer narratives (storytelling) effectively engage patients, one-time interventions may not sustain blood pressure improvements. This study describes the development of a culturally sensitive text-messaging protocol designed to provide longitudinal support for hypertension self-management among African American Veterans. Utilizing the Veterans Affairs 'Annie' texting system, the researchers integrated narrative content from Veteran stories into a 6-month intervention. The protocol aims to support behavior change and improve blood pressure control, with a randomized trial underway to test its efficacy.",
      "detailedDescription": "The study focuses on the multistep process of developing a text-messaging intervention for African American Veterans with hypertension. The intervention builds upon previous work involving video-recorded stories of Veterans sharing their strategies for managing hypertension. The text messages were designed for the 'Annie' platform, a Veterans Affairs (VA) SMS system. \n\nThe development process included: \n1. Reviewing story transcripts to identify key self-management concepts (e.g., salt reduction, medication adherence, physical activity, stress management, alcohol and tobacco use).\n2. Transforming excerpts from five Veteran storytellers into 160-character narrative texts that preserve the storyteller's voice.\n3. creating non-narrative educational messages based on guidelines from the American Heart Association and CDC.\n4. Developing interactive 2-way messages to assess self-efficacy and behavior, informed by Social Cognitive Theory.\n\nA multidisciplinary team, including sociolinguists, behavior specialists, and African American Veteran consultants, refined the content to ensure cultural sensitivity and authenticity. The result is five distinct 6-month protocols, each corresponding to a specific Veteran storyteller, allowing participants to choose the narrative that resonates most with them. The protocols consist of 2-week blocks covering specific content areas, combining narrative, educational, and interactive messages."
