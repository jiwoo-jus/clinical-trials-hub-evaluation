      "briefSummary": "This study aims to adapt an automated motivational text messaging system, previously developed for US smokers, to support smoking cessation among rural Vietnamese smokers. The primary objective is to promote cessation directly and by increasing the use of telephone Quitline counseling services and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). The researchers hypothesize that participants in the intervention arm receiving motivational texts and assessment messages will have higher rates of cessation, higher smoking self-efficacy, and will engage more frequently with Quitline counseling and NRT services compared to a control group receiving assessment messages only.",
      "detailedDescription": "We are testing the effectiveness of a culturally adapted motivational text messaging system (M2Q2) using a community-based randomized controlled trial design. Participants were recruited from four communes in the Hung Yen province in the Red River Delta region of Vietnam. The study involves adapting an existing cessation texting system proven effective in the United States to the Vietnamese context.\n\nParticipants (N=750 recruited; target N=600 for completion) were randomly allocated to one of two conditions for a period of 6 months:\n1. Intervention Group: Receives regular motivational text messages (one per day in the first week, two per week in weeks 2-26) derived from expert sources based on social cognitive theory and peer messages from Vietnamese smokers. They also receive weekly two-way assessment messages asking about smoking frequency and offering a callback from the Bach Mai Quitline. Affirmative responses result in a Quitline call offering counseling and access to free Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT).\n2. Control Group: Receives only two-way assessment text messages every two weeks asking about smoking frequency in the past 24 hours. They do not receive specific encouragement to use the Quitline but may independently seek care.\n\nThe primary outcome is the tobacco cessation rate at the 6-month follow-up, determined by self-report and verified with a carbon monoxide breath monitor (less than 10 ppm). Secondary outcomes include changes in smoking self-efficacy measured by the 12-item Smoking Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (SEQ-12), uptake of the Quitline, and use of nicotine replacement therapy. The study also aims to enhance research and health service capacity in Vietnam through training and collaboration with the Bach Mai Quitline."
