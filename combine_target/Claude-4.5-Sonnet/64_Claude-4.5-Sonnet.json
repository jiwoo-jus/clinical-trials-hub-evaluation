      "briefSummary": "The RECORGEN study is a retrospective single-center cohort study evaluating the effectiveness and safety of ultrasound-guided conventional radiofrequency (RF) treatment of the genicular nerves in patients with chronic knee pain. The study included patients treated between September 2017 and June 2020 at Hospital Oost-Limburg, Genk. The study population consisted of patients with chronic anterior knee pain due to either persistent post-surgical knee pain (PPSP) or degenerative knee pain refractory to conventional medical management. The primary outcome was treatment success defined as global perceived effect (GPE) of at least 50% improvement at 6 weeks post-treatment. Secondary outcomes included pain reduction measured by Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), duration of treatment effect, changes in strong opioid consumption, functional improvement, and safety profile. Treatment success was achieved in 32.2% of patients at 6 weeks, with similar results in both PPSP and degenerative knee pain groups. Among responders, 45.1% maintained a positive effect at follow-up (mean 17 months), with a mean duration of effect of 8.3 months. The treatment demonstrated a good safety profile with minor adverse events.",
      "detailedDescription": "This retrospective observational study analyzed 59 cases (46 PPSP and 13 degenerative knee pain) who underwent ultrasound-guided conventional RF treatment of three genicular nerves (superomedial, inferomedial, and superolateral) following a positive diagnostic block with lidocaine 2%. The RF procedure was performed at 70°C for 90 seconds per nerve after confirming sensory threshold ≤0.5V and excluding motor stimulation at 1.0V. The study population had a mean age of 62 years with median pain duration of 42 months before intervention. All patients had chronic knee pain refractory to conventional medical management, with 27% using strong opioids at baseline. In the PPSP group, 43 of 46 cases developed pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA), with 15 undergoing multiple TKA surgeries. The degenerative pain group included patients with osteoarthritis, soft tissue disease, and post-traumatic pain. Data were collected at baseline, 6 weeks post-procedure, and at a variable second time point (mean 17 months). At 6 weeks, treatment success (GPE≥50%) was achieved in 32.2% of all patients (30.8% in degenerative pain group, 32.6% in PPSP group). Mean NRS decreased from 7.4 at baseline to 6.0 at 6 weeks (p=0.001). NRS reduction ≥50% was achieved in 22% of all participants at 6 weeks. Among 17 responders followed long-term, 35.3% maintained treatment success at the second time point with mean duration of effect of 8.3 months. Strong opioid use decreased from 27.1% at baseline to 18.6% at 6 weeks. Adverse events at 6 weeks included hypoesthesia (4 patients, 6.8%), instability, pain increase, hematoma, and CRPS flare (1 case each). No new adverse events were reported at long-term follow-up except persistent paresthesia in one patient. The study demonstrated that conventional RF treatment of genicular nerves is a relatively safe intervention with moderate effectiveness in chronic knee pain patients refractory to conventional management."
