      "briefSummary": "This Phase 2a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial investigated whether combining methylphenidate (MPH) with escitalopram would improve medication adherence in individuals with moderate to severe depression. The hypothesis was that pairing an acute positive reinforcing dopaminergic/noradrenergic effect (MPH) with a standard antidepressant would increase rates of adherence to medication treatment by facilitating habit formation. The study aimed to determine whether MPH + escitalopram resulted in higher rates of medication adherence compared to placebo + escitalopram over an 8-week treatment period.",
      "detailedDescription": "Adherence to antidepressant treatment is a critical challenge in mental health care, with only one out of five patients complying with treatment for over 4 months. Non-adherence leads to adverse consequences including increased relapse, recurrence, and significant healthcare costs. This study was based on the premise that forming new treatment-related habits requires a transition from reward-related to habit-based behavioral strategies. Depressed individuals face specific barriers to habit formation including reduced hedonic processing mediated by impaired dopaminergic function and compromised functioning of neural circuits involved in habit formation (hippocampus to basal ganglia transition).\n\nThe trial utilized a two-stage Bayesian design with Stage 1 enrolling 20 participants (1:1 randomization) to receive either (1) 5 mg MPH + 10 mg escitalopram or (2) placebo + 10 mg escitalopram, encapsulated together, with possible dose escalation to 20 mg escitalopram at week 4. Participants were followed for 8 weeks with in-person visits at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 8, and phone follow-ups at weeks 1, 3, and 6.\n\nThe primary endpoint was percent adherence measured by pill count. The secondary endpoint was percent of doses taken on schedule (within ±6 hours of usual time) measured by Medication Electronic Monitoring System (MEMS). Exploratory endpoints included the Beliefs About Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ), remission rates (QIDS-SR ≤5), and response rates (50% reduction in QIDS-SR scores).\n\nMethylphenidate was selected based on its mechanism as a monoaminergic reuptake inhibitor that blocks dopamine reuptake transporters and increases dopamine and norepinephrine availability. Unlike amphetamines or cocaine, MPH has relatively weak reinforcing properties and lower abuse liability. It has been used successfully in treating ADHD and has shown benefits in cognitive symptoms following brain injury.\n\nThe Bayesian statistical approach allowed for continuous evaluation of treatment effects using informative and weakly informative priors, with planned interim analysis to determine study continuation. Linear mixed-effects models evaluated treatment effects on adherence outcomes controlling for visit effects and treatment-by-visit interactions. Stage 2 (planned 80 additional participants) was not completed as Stage 1 results showed effects opposite to the hypothesis with low posterior probabilities (<25%) that MPH was superior to placebo."
