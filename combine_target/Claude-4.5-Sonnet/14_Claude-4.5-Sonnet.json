      "briefSummary": "This study investigates whether combining therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) with convalescent plasma (CVP) transfusion early in the intensive care unit (ICU) stay improves survival among critically ill COVID-19 patients. The primary endpoint is survival at 30 days. Secondary endpoints include assessing the evolution of biomarkers such as the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional inspired oxygen ratio (P/F ratio), and C reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and ferritin levels at the 7-day follow-up. This single centre, prospective, non-randomized controlled trial included 38 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring intensive care treatment. A total of 19 patients were treated by performing TPE followed by CVP transfusion in addition to standard treatment, while another 19 patients received only standard treatment according to hospital protocols. TPE was initiated during the first 24 hours after ICU admission, followed immediately by transfusion of CVP.",
      "detailedDescription": "Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has been proposed as a rescue therapy in critically ill COVID-19 patients. The aim of the present study was to determine whether combining TPE with convalescent plasma (CVP) transfusion early in the intensive care unit (ICU) stay improves survival among this heterogeneous population. The primary endpoint was survival at 30 days. Secondary endpoints included assessing the evolution of biomarkers, such as the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional inspired oxygen ratio (P/F ratio), and C reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ferritin levels at the 7-day follow-up.\n\nThis single centre, prospective, non-randomized controlled trial was conducted in an 8-bed COVID-19 ICU and included patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring intensive care treatment. A total of 19 patients were treated by performing TPE followed by CVP transfusion, in addition to standard treatment, while for another 19 patients, only standard treatment according to hospital protocols was used. TPE was initiated during the first 24 hours after ICU admission, followed immediately by transfusion of CVP.\n\nThe study cohort of 38 patients included 24 males and 14 females, with a median age of 63 years. Patients were mainly overweight and 92.11% had comorbidities (mostly arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease and obesity). According to clinical and radiological correlations, 57.89% of patients had a severe form of the disease while 42.11% were considered critical. Time interval from symptom onset to treatment was a median of 8 days.\n\nIn the treatment group, a dual lumen, 14 French, dialysis catheter was used for vascular access. A single TPE session was performed with a plasma/blood separation ratio of 20%, using 40 ml/kg fresh frozen plasma as the substitute. Upon completion of the TPE session, each patient from the treatment group was transfused with 500 ml of ABO compatible CVP. Patients from both groups received standard treatment for COVID-19 according to hospital protocols, consisting of corticosteroids, antiretrovirals, anticoagulants and antibiotics if deemed necessary.\n\nThe study indicated that early initiation of TPE followed by CVP transfusion may be a valid rescue therapy in severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients, with a statistically significant survival benefit, improved oxygenation and a reduction in inflammatory markers."
