      "briefSummary": "This is a prospective, open label, multicenter clinical trial conducted in China to evaluate the efficacy and safety of leuprorelin for the treatment of central precocious puberty (CPP) in children. A total of 307 CPP patients (305 females and 2 males) were treated with 1.88 to 3.75 mg leuprorelin subcutaneously once every 4 weeks for 96 weeks between 2015 and 2018. The primary endpoint was the rate of occurrence of adverse events and the secondary endpoint was no progression in the Tanner stage or regression by week 96 compared to baseline.",
      "detailedDescription": "Central precocious puberty (CPP) is triggered by the early activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, resulting in inappropriate release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and the onset of puberty. Leuprorelin is a GnRH analog that downregulates the GnRH receptor, inhibits gonadotropin secretion, and lowers gonadotropin concentrations to pre-adolescent levels, preventing further development of secondary sexual characteristics and inhibiting the HPG axis.\n\nThis study enrolled 307 children diagnosed with CPP from 11 medical centers in China between August 2015 and November 2018. The study included a 4-week screening period, 96-week leuprorelin treatment, and 4-week safety follow-ups. Eligible CPP patients with body mass ≥20 kg received 3.75 mg leuprorelin subcutaneously once every 4 weeks, while those with body mass <20 kg received 1.88 mg at 4-week intervals. The dose was adjusted based on patient condition and investigator judgment.\n\nEfficacy assessments included Tanner stage evaluation, height and body mass measurements, gonadotropin and sex hormone concentrations, bone mineral density (BMD) measurement, bone age (BA) assessments, and ultrasonography of the pelvis. Safety assessment was mainly monitoring of adverse events. The primary endpoint was the rate of occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). The main secondary endpoint was the percentage of patients that experienced regression or no progression in the Tanner stage at week 96 compared with baseline. Additional endpoints included suppression of peak LH and FSH to pre-pubertal concentrations, suppression of basal estradiol or testosterone concentrations, improvement in predicted adult height, decrease in the ratio of bone age to chronological age, and changes in BMI and BMD."
