      "briefSummary": "This randomized, double-blind trial evaluated the safety and tolerability profile of sugammadex-mediated recovery from neuromuscular block in participants undergoing surgery who met the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Class 3 or 4 criteria. The study specifically assessed the impact of sugammadex on cardiac adverse events and other prespecified adverse events of clinical interest compared to neostigmine and glycopyrrolate. Participants were stratified by ASA Class and neuromuscular blocking agent (rocuronium or vecuronium) and randomized to receive sugammadex at various doses (2 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg, or 16 mg/kg for rocuronium only) or neostigmine/glycopyrrolate for reversal of moderate or deep neuromuscular block. Primary endpoints included treatment-emergent sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, and other cardiac arrhythmias.",
      "detailedDescription": "This was a randomized, active comparator-controlled, multi-site, parallel-group, double-blind safety study conducted at 27 sites in 4 countries from December 2017 to September 2019. The study enrolled 344 participants (331 treated) who were ASA Physical Class 3 or 4 adults (≥18 years) with BMI <40 kg/m² undergoing surgical procedures requiring moderate or deep neuromuscular block with rocuronium or vecuronium.\n\nParticipants were stratified by ASA Class (3 or 4) and neuromuscular blocking agent (rocuronium or vecuronium) and randomized to one of four treatment groups:\n1. Moderate neuromuscular block reversed with sugammadex 2 mg/kg\n2. Moderate neuromuscular block reversed with neostigmine (50 μg/kg, max 5 mg) plus glycopyrrolate (10 μg/kg, max 1 mg)\n3. Deep neuromuscular block reversed with sugammadex 4 mg/kg\n4. Deep neuromuscular block reversed with sugammadex 16 mg/kg (rocuronium stratum only)\n\nThe anesthesiologist was blinded to the reversal agent in moderate block arms and to the sugammadex dose in deep block arms. A separate safety assessor was blinded to all treatment details. Continuous electrocardiogram monitoring began ≥5 minutes before study medication and continued ≥30 minutes after administration.\n\nPrimary safety endpoints included incidences of treatment-emergent (TE) sinus bradycardia (heart rate <60/min or >20% decrease from baseline), TE sinus tachycardia (heart rate ≥100/min or >20% increase from baseline), and other TE cardiac arrhythmias occurring within 35 minutes of study medication administration and sustained for ≥1 minute.\n\nEvents of clinical interest included clinically relevant arrhythmias requiring intervention, adjudicated hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, and drug-induced liver injury. Safety was assessed through adverse event monitoring up to 7 days post-treatment (with supplemental data to 14 days), laboratory parameters, and vital signs.\n\nResults showed that TE sinus bradycardia incidence was significantly lower with sugammadex 2 mg/kg versus neostigmine/glycopyrrolate (P=0.026). TE sinus tachycardia incidence was significantly lower with sugammadex 2 mg/kg (P=0.007) and 4 mg/kg (P=0.036) versus neostigmine/glycopyrrolate. No significant differences in other TE cardiac arrhythmias were observed between groups. There were no cases of adjudicated anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity reactions. Overall adverse event profiles were similar across treatment groups, with no clinically meaningful safety concerns identified."
