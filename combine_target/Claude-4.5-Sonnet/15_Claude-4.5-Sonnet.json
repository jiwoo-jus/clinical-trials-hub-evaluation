      "briefSummary": "This study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Nocturia Impact (NI) Diary as part of a randomized, controlled Phase 2 clinical trial investigating a novel drug candidate for nocturnal polyuria. Adult nocturia patients completed the NI Diary and a voiding diary for three nights preceding clinic visits at Baseline and Weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12. Exit interviews were conducted to obtain patient impressions of the NI Diary. The study aimed to support the use of the NI Diary as a trial endpoint by demonstrating its reliability, validity, and interpretability in measuring the impact of nocturia on patient quality of life.",
      "detailedDescription": "Nocturia, or waking to pass urine during the main sleep period, is a highly prevalent lower urinary tract syndrome affecting men and women of all ages, with higher rates in older populations. The most common cause is nocturnal polyuria—overproduction of urine at night. Nocturia has a pronounced negative impact on patient quality of life (QoL) and is associated with reduced work productivity, more frequent physician visits, socioeconomic burden, sleep impairment, higher risk of falls and fractures, depression, and increased mortality. There has been an unmet need for a validated, reliable, and specific patient-reported instrument to assess the impact of nocturia on patient QoL.\n\nThe 12-item Nocturia Impact (NI) Diary was developed in dialogue with the FDA to measure the daily symptom impact of nocturia, to be used in conjunction with a nocturnal voiding diary. The NI Diary has 11 core items assessing impacts such as sleep disturbance, emotional disturbance, and fatigue, and a single overall QoL item. This study extends previous work by investigating the reliability, validity, and interpretability of the NI Diary in a larger sample (N=302 participants) using a range of psychometric evaluations.\n\nThe study was conducted as part of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial (NCT03201419; DAWN) of patients with nocturia investigating the safety and efficacy of a novel drug for nocturnal polyuria. Patients completed the NI Diary and the nocturnal voiding diary for three nights preceding each visit at the clinic at Baseline, Week 1, 4, 8, and 12 (end of treatment). Exit interviews were conducted in 66 patients to obtain patient impressions of the NI Diary and what constitutes meaningful change.\n\nPsychometric analyses included: quality of completion, item distribution and floor/ceiling effects, inter-item and item-total correlations, item discrimination indices and curves, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, convergent validity, known-groups validity, and meaningful change threshold (MCT) determination using both anchor-based and distribution-based methods.\n\nResults demonstrated that the NI Diary is unidimensional with good model fit (CFI, TLI, and RMSEA meeting relevant thresholds), excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α=0.941), and good test-retest reliability (ICC 0.730-0.880). Convergent validity was demonstrated with strong correlations (0.573-0.730) with reference measures. Known-groups validity was supported by significant differences between groups defined by number of night-time voids. Exit interviews indicated that a 1-point improvement on the item response scale and 1-void reduction per night constituted meaningful improvement. Anchor and distribution-based analyses identified a meaningful change threshold of -15 to -18 points on the NI Diary total score."
