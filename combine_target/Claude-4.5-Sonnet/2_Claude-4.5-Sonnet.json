      "briefSummary": "This phase 3 randomized double-blind clinical trial evaluated dasiglucagon, a next-generation ready-to-use glucagon analog, for treatment of severe hypoglycemia in adults with type 1 diabetes. The study compared a single subcutaneous dose of 0.6 mg dasiglucagon against placebo and reconstituted glucagon in reversing insulin-induced hypoglycemia, measuring time to plasma glucose recovery and treatment efficacy.",
      "detailedDescription": "This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigated the efficacy and safety of dasiglucagon for reversing insulin-induced hypoglycemia in adults with type 1 diabetes. Participants received intravenous insulin infusion to induce hypoglycemia (target plasma glucose <60 mg/dL), followed by subcutaneous administration of 0.6 mg dasiglucagon, placebo, or reconstituted glucagon. The primary endpoint was time from injection to plasma glucose recovery, defined as an increase of ≥20 mg/dL from baseline without rescue intravenous glucose. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of participants achieving recovery within specific time intervals and change in plasma glucose. The trial demonstrated that dasiglucagon provided rapid reversal of hypoglycemia comparable to reconstituted glucagon, with median time to recovery of 10 minutes. The ready-to-use aqueous formulation eliminates the need for reconstitution required by traditional glucagon products, potentially improving ease of administration in emergency situations. Safety profile was comparable to reconstituted glucagon, with nausea and vomiting being the most common adverse events."
