      "briefSummary": "This Phase 4 randomized controlled trial investigates potential differences in myocardial effects between oxytocin 2.5 IU and carbetocin 100 µg in healthy women undergoing planned caesarean delivery. Both drugs are used to prevent uterine atony and postpartum haemorrhage, but while oxytocin is known to cause dose-dependent ST-depression, troponin release, QT-time prolongation and arrhythmia, little is known about the myocardial effects of carbetocin. The study hypothesizes that there may be differences in cardiac markers between the two drugs. Following a pilot study of 40 women that demonstrated reduced high-sensitivity troponin I changes with carbetocin compared to oxytocin, this larger trial will enroll 240 healthy singleton pregnant women aged 18-50 years at three Norwegian hospitals. The primary outcome is change from baseline in high-sensitive troponin I plasma concentrations at 6-10 hours after drug administration.",
      "detailedDescription": "This is a parallel group, randomized, patient- and investigator-blinded Phase 4 study conducted at three obstetrics units at Oslo University Hospital (two clinics) and Akershus University Hospital in Norway. The study follows a pilot study (NCT02528136) that enrolled 40 women and demonstrated a reduction in changes in high sensitivity troponin I levels from baseline with carbetocin (0.41±0.79 ng/L) compared with oxytocin (1.78±4.48 ng/L) after elective cesarean delivery, with peak changes occurring 10 hours after drug administration. Participants will be healthy women with normal singleton pregnancies at gestational age of 36 weeks or more who are able to read and understand Norwegian. Women with common comorbid diagnoses such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypertension are included. Each participant will receive a one-minute intravenous injection of either oxytocin 2.5 IU or carbetocin 100 µg during caesarean delivery. The prespecified primary outcome is change from baseline in high-sensitive troponin I plasma concentrations at 6-10 hours after study drug administration, with baseline samples collected before caesarean delivery. All troponin I levels will be batch assessed and investigators will not have access to results until after the last patient completes the study. Secondary outcomes include uterine tone grade at 2.5 and five minutes after study drug administration, adverse events for up to 48 hours after study drug administration, estimated blood loss within eight hours of delivery, need for rescue treatment, and direct/indirect costs. The study is designed as a superiority trial powered to confirm findings of the previous pilot work. Primary analysis will be by modified intention to treat using independent student t-test followed by regression modeling. Additional prospective sub-analysis will be conducted on patients who did not receive rescue treatment for uterine atony. The rationale for this study is that women undergoing caesarean delivery should be assessed for cardiovascular risk, particularly as women with obstetric history of pregnancy-induced hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm birth, placental abruption, and stillbirth are at increased risk of future cardiovascular disease. Any additional ischemic myocardial risk from uterotonic agents needs to be balanced against the benefit of reducing postpartum hemorrhage risk. Enrollment started in April 2019 and was completed in February 2022, with primary analysis expected by end of 2021. The study is conducted according to Good Clinical Practice principles with origins in the Declaration of Helsinki and has approval from the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics and the Norwegian Medicines Agency."
