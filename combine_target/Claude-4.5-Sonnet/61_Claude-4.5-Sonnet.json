      "briefSummary": "This randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial evaluated whether inhaled and intranasal ciclesonide can reduce respiratory symptoms in adult outpatients with covid-19. Participants were adults aged 18 years and older with polymerase chain reaction confirmed covid-19, presenting with fever, cough, or dyspnoea. They were randomised to receive either inhaled ciclesonide (600 μg twice daily) and intranasal ciclesonide (200 μg daily) or metered dose inhaler and nasal saline placebos for 14 days. The primary outcome was symptom resolution at day 7. The study aimed to determine if early administration of ciclesonide, which has demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and known anti-inflammatory effects, could decrease symptom burden in adults presenting with prominent respiratory symptoms.",
      "detailedDescription": "The Inhaled Ciclesonide for the Treatment of COVID-19 in Nonhospitalized Adults (CONTAIN) trial was a multicentre, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial conducted across three Canadian provinces (Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia). Participants were recruited through social media, telephone contact of individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, virtual telehealth clinics, and regional health authority lists. Eligible participants were adults aged 18 years and older with polymerase chain reaction confirmed covid-19 at enrolment, presenting with at least one of the following respiratory symptoms: fever, cough (wet or dry), or shortness of breath (including dyspnoea, chest congestion, or chest tightness). Exclusion criteria included hospital admission, having only non-respiratory symptoms, or already being prescribed an inhaled steroid. Participants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either inhaled ciclesonide (600 μg twice daily) and intranasal ciclesonide (200 μg daily) or matching placebos (saline metered dose inhaler and intranasal saline) for 14 days. The study aimed to recruit participants within five to six days of symptom onset or positive polymerase chain reaction test result to ensure early treatment initiation. The primary outcome was the resolution of self-reported fever and all respiratory symptoms (cough or dyspnoea) at day 7 of treatment. Secondary outcomes included hospital admission or death with covid-19, symptom resolution at day 14, improvement in overall feeling, resolution of dyspnoea, improvement in cough, and improvement in sleep, anxiety, and dyspnoea as measured by PROMIS (patient reported outcomes measurement information system) questionnaires. Participants completed surveys on day 0 (day of treatment receipt) and on days 1, 3, 7, 10, and 14, with a follow-up survey on day 29. Adverse events were collected through open-ended questions and specific queries about common side effects. The trial was stopped early in June 2021 due to declining case numbers and increased vaccination rates in Canada, resulting in an inability to meet the intended sample size. The modified intention-to-treat population included 203 participants (105 in the ciclesonide group and 98 in the placebo group). The median age was 35 years, 54% were women, and the majority were young and healthy with a high burden of respiratory symptoms. The trial was designed to detect a 15% absolute risk increase in symptom resolution from a baseline of 65% to 80% by day 7."
