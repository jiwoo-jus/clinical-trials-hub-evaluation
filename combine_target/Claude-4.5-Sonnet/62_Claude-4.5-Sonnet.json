      "briefSummary": "This prospective randomized trial compared the clinical performance of THUNDERBEAT, a multi-functional energy device delivering both ultrasonic and bipolar energy, to Maryland LigaSure, a bipolar energy device, in patients undergoing laparoscopic left colectomy. The hypothesis was that THUNDERBEAT would demonstrate superior or comparable performance in terms of dissection time and versatility in soft tissue dissection and vessel sealing compared to LigaSure.",
      "detailedDescription": "This was a pilot prospective randomized trial conducted at a single academic institution to evaluate the clinical performance of THUNDERBEAT versus Maryland LigaSure energy devices in laparoscopic left colectomy. Sixty patients undergoing elective laparoscopic left colectomy for neoplasm or diverticulitis were randomized with equal allocation into two groups: Group 1 (THUNDERBEAT, n=31) and Group 2 (LigaSure, n=29). The primary outcomes were dissection time to specimen removal (DTSR), measured from the start of colon mobilization to specimen removal, and versatility score, a composite measure of five variables (hemostasis, sealing, cutting, dissection, and tissue manipulation) evaluated across six surgical segments using a 1-5 scoring system, adjusted by coefficient of importance. Secondary outcomes included dryness of surgical field, ease of use (surgeon survey), intraoperative and postoperative complications, estimated blood loss, and 30-day postoperative outcomes including gastrointestinal recovery, length of hospital stay, readmission, reoperation, and mortality. All surgeries were video recorded, and participating surgeons were trained on both devices prior to the trial. The study aimed to provide rigorous evaluation of the clinical performance and safety of these energy-based devices in colorectal surgery, particularly focusing on their effectiveness in vessel sealing, tissue dissection, and overall surgical versatility during different phases of left colectomy."
