      "briefSummary": "Globally, approximately half of the estimated 6.3 million under-5 deaths occur in the neonatal period (within the first 28 days of life). Kenya ranks among countries with the highest number of neonatal deaths, at 20 per 1000 live births. This study evaluates an interactive (two-way) short messaging service (SMS) communication intervention, Mobile Solutions for Neonatal Health (Mobile WACh NEO), focused on the perinatal period. The intervention sends automated tailored SMS messages to mothers during pregnancy and up to 6 weeks post partum to promote essential newborn care, identification of neonatal danger signs and care-seeking, and maternal social support and self-efficacy. This is a two-arm unblinded randomised controlled trial enrolling 5000 pregnant women in the third trimester at 4 facilities in Kenya, randomised 1:1 to receive interactive SMS or no SMS (control), with follow-up visits at 2 and 6 weeks post partum. The primary outcome is neonatal mortality. Secondary outcomes include care-seeking, practice of essential newborn care and psychosocial health.",
      "detailedDescription": "This study describes a two-arm unblinded randomised controlled trial of the Mobile WACh NEO intervention. The study will enrol 5000 pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy at 4 facilities in Kenya and randomise them 1:1 to receive interactive SMS or no SMS (control), and conduct follow-up visits at 2 and 6 weeks post partum. Neonatal mortality will be compared between arms as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include care-seeking, practice of essential newborn care (ENC) and psychosocial health. Exploratory analysis will investigate associations between maternal mental health, practice of ENC, care-seeking and SMS engagement.\n\nThe Mobile WACh NEO SMS intervention employs the Information-Motivation-Behaviour Skills framework to promote: (1) maternal implementation of essential newborn care (including early, exclusive breast feeding, cord care and thermal care), (2) maternal identification of neonatal danger signs and care-seeking, and (3) maternal social support and self-efficacy. Participants can also send SMS to the study nurse, enabling on-demand remote support.\n\nParticipants randomised to the two-way SMS arm receive a series of automated SMS messages during pregnancy and until 6 weeks post partum. Message content is designed based on estimated gestational age or time since delivery. Messages are sent in English, Dholuo or Kiswahili depending on the participant's preference. From enrolment until 38 weeks gestation, automated SMS are delivered weekly. From 38 weeks gestation until delivery, women receive daily messages. From delivery to 2 weeks post partum, mothers receive two messages per day: one message with screening questions for identification of infant danger signs and one message with educational content on ENC practices, mental health and support. From 2 to 6 weeks post partum, SMSs are delivered every other day. Participants can send SMS messages to the study at any time and study nurses respond by SMS during business hours within one business day.\n\nThe study is conducted at six healthcare facilities in Kenya: Mathare North Health Centre, Riruta Health Centre, Rachuonyo County Hospital, Bondo Sub-County Referral Hospital, Ahero County Hospital and Kisumu County Hospital. Four facilities are in rural locations in Western Kenya, and two facilities are in urban locations in Nairobi.\n\nEligible participants are ≥14 years old, pregnant at 28-36 weeks estimated gestational age, enrolled in antenatal care at a study site, have daily access to a shared or personal mobile phone with a subscriber identity module on the Safaricom network, are willing to receive SMS, plan to stay in the area for 5 months or greater, and are not enrolled in another study.\n\nData are collected at study visits at enrolment in pregnancy, 2 weeks post partum, and 6 weeks post partum using tablet-based questionnaires. The questionnaire ascertains demographic characteristics, clinical and pregnancy history, family planning, experience with SMS and technology, social support, intimate partner violence, maternal and child health status, breastfeeding plans, parental self-efficacy, and depression. Standardised instruments are used to assess depressive symptoms, social support and parenting self-efficacy. Following the 6-week study visit, in-depth interviews are conducted with 60 intervention participants to gather data on their experience with the SMS curriculum."
