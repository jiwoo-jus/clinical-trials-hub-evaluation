      "briefSummary": "Testing men for HIV during their partner's pregnancy can guide couples-based HIV prevention and treatment, but testing rates remain low. This study investigated a combination approach using evidence-based strategies to increase HIV testing in male partners of both HIV-positive and HIV-negative pregnant women. Two parallel, unmasked randomised trials were conducted at an antenatal setting in Lusaka, Zambia. Women in control groups received partner notification services only; those in intervention groups additionally received targeted education on oral HIV self-test kits for their partners, along with up to five test kits. The primary outcome was reported male partner testing at a health facility within 30 days following randomisation.",
      "detailedDescription": "This study comprised two parallel, unmasked randomised controlled trials enrolling pregnant women from an antenatal setting in Lusaka, Zambia. Trial 1 enrolled pregnant women who had an HIV-positive test result documented in their antenatal record; Trial 2 enrolled women who had an HIV-negative test result documented in their antenatal record within the past 3 months during the current pregnancy. Women in both trials were randomly assigned (1:1) to intervention or control groups using permuted block randomisation.\n\nControl groups in both trials received partner notification services only, including an adapted version for women who were HIV-negative. These services included four options for male partner HIV testing: client self-referral, provider contract referral, provider referral, and dual referral. Intervention groups additionally received targeted education on the use of oral HIV self-test kits (OraQuick) for their partners, along with up to five oral HIV self-test kits. All participants were offered these interventions at enrolment and were counseled that facility-based HIV testing by a healthcare provider was recommended regardless of study group allocation. This included confirmatory HIV testing at a healthcare facility for those who first tested at home or in the community.\n\nThe primary outcome was the proportion of primary male partners reported to have tested for HIV at a health facility within 30 days of participant enrolment. A prespecified secondary outcome was the proportion of primary male partners reported to have HIV testing of any kind (including HIV self-testing in the household and other community-based venues) within 30 days of randomisation. At the 30-day follow-up visit, information was collected from pregnant women about their primary male partner's HIV testing, including date, modality, and venue. Screening for intimate partner violence and social harms was also conducted at follow-up.\n\nFrom October 28, 2019, to May 26, 2020, 116 women who were HIV-positive (trial 1) and 210 women who were HIV-negative (trial 2) were enrolled and randomly assigned to study groups. Retention at 30 days was 100 (86%) in trial 1 and 200 (95%) in trial 2. Due to the emergence of COVID-19, modifications were made to follow-up protocols from March 2020 onward, including offering telephone interviews at follow-up for those unable to travel safely to the study clinic, although the main outcome remained the same."
