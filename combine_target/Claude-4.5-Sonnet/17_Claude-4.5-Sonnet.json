      "briefSummary": "This multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial investigated the safety and efficacy of Tenoten, an anxiolytic drug containing highly diluted antibodies to S100 protein, in treating anxiety in adults with somatoform dysfunction (SfD), reaction to severe stress (RSS), adjustment disorders (AjD), and other neurotic disorders (oNDs). A total of 390 adult patients with HADS-A score ≥11 were randomized into 4 groups: Tenoten group 1 (4 tablets/day, n=127), Tenoten group 3 (8 tablets/day, n=131), and combined Placebo groups (n=132). The primary outcome was the change from baseline in mean Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) score after 12 weeks. Results showed significant decrease in HAM-A scores in both Tenoten groups compared to placebo (p=0.0055 for group 1, p<0.0001 for group 3). A total of 46 adverse events were reported (28 in Tenoten groups, 18 in Placebo) with no significant difference between groups. The study concluded that Tenoten was significantly more effective than placebo in treating anxiety in adults with SfD, RSS, AjD, and oNDs.",
      "detailedDescription": "The existing treatments for somatoform dysfunction (SfD), reaction to severe stress (RSS), and adjustment disorders (AjD) are insufficiently effective and safe. This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of Tenoten, an anxiolytic drug containing highly diluted antibodies to S100 protein, in treating anxiety in adults with these conditions and other neurotic disorders (oNDs). The trial was a multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial conducted at 23 sites in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan between February 2017 and March 2019.\n\nOutpatients aged 18-45 years with anxiety and diagnosed SfD (F45.0-F45.9), RSS and AjD (F43.0-F43.9), or other NDs (F48.8-F48.9) with HADS-A scores ≥11 were enrolled. A total of 390 patients were randomized into 4 groups: Tenoten group 1 (2 pills 2 times/day, n=127), Tenoten group 3 (2 pills 4 times/day, n=131), and Placebo groups 2+4 (combined, n=132). The treatment period lasted 12 weeks.\n\nThe primary outcome was the change from baseline in mean HAM-A score after 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included changes at 4 and 8 weeks, percentage of responders (≥50% reduction on HAM-A), percentage of patients without anxiety (HAM-A <14), changes in EQ-5D-3L scores, and CGI-EI scores. Post-hoc analysis assessed the effect of diagnosis type on HAM-A scores and subscores.\n\nResults showed significant decrease in HAM-A scores in both Tenoten groups: from 18.81±5.81 to 7.26±4.63 in group 1 (p=0.0055 vs placebo) and from 18.38±4.3 to 6.40±4.02 in group 3 (p<0.0001 vs placebo). Remission rates (HAM-A <14) after 12 weeks were 88.1% in group 1 and 96.2% in group 3 (p=0.007 vs placebo for group 3). Response rates (≥50% reduction) were 69.8% and 73.8% in groups 1 and 3, respectively, compared to 53.9% in placebo (p<0.05). Quality of life improved significantly in group 3 (p=0.031 vs placebo).\n\nSafety analysis showed 46 adverse events (10 in group 1, 18 in group 3, 18 in placebo) with no significant difference between groups. No serious adverse events or definite drug-related adverse events were reported. The study concluded that Tenoten demonstrated significant efficacy over placebo in treating anxiety in adults with SfD, RSS, AjD, and oNDs, with a favorable safety profile."
