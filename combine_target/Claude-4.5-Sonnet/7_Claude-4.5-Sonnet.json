      "briefSummary": "This phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single- and multiple-ascending dose, parallel-group study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of trazpiroben (TAK-906) in healthy Japanese men. Overall, 24 participants were enrolled into 3 cohorts (each n = 8). Per cohort, 6 participants received trazpiroben (cohort 1, 50 mg; cohort 2, 100 mg; cohort 3, 10 mg) once on day 1 and twice daily on days 3 through 7, and two received placebo. The study aimed to compare findings with those from a prior US trial in healthy individuals to assess potential ethnic differences in drug disposition and safety profile.",
      "detailedDescription": "Trazpiroben (TAK-906) is a peripherally selective dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist being developed to treat chronic gastroparesis. This study was conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability, and the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of single and multiple oral doses of trazpiroben in healthy Japanese men. The study design was made consistent with that of the US AT-01C study to allow informal comparison of intrinsic similarities and differences between the 2 populations.\n\nAfter a 27-day screening period, participants received a single dose of blinded study drug on day 1 (single-dose phase), followed by multiple doses of blinded study drug twice daily for 5 days from day 3 through day 7 (multiple-dose phase), without an evening dose on day 7. Follow-up assessments occurred on day 14 (7 days after the completion of the last treatment dose). The study drug in the single-dose phase and all morning doses in the multiple-dose phase were orally administered after a fast of at least 10 hours that continued for at least 4 hours after dosing, with water intake prohibited for at least 1 hour before and after dosing. The evening dose was administered 12 hours after the morning dose and at least 2 hours after the evening meal.\n\nSafety measures evaluated included adverse events (AEs), physical and vital signs, and ECG parameters. Blood samples for trazpiroben and its metabolite M23 were collected at multiple time points for PK analysis. Serum prolactin concentrations were measured as a biomarker for dopamine D2 receptor antagonism for PD analysis.\n\nTrazpiroben was well tolerated, with no clinically meaningful adverse events observed. Following single- and multiple-dose administration, trazpiroben was rapidly absorbed and eliminated (mean elimination half-life, 1.89-6.45 hours; median time to maximum serum concentration [steady state], 1.00-1.25 hours). Serum prolactin increased with trazpiroben treatment, illustrating receptor target engagement. Results reflected those from healthy US participants, indicating a lack of differences between these ethnic populations in trazpiroben disposition and safety profile."
