      "briefSummary": "This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study to estimate the efficacy and safety of cabergoline, a novel nonhormonal therapeutic agent, compared with norethindrone acetate (NETA), the standard clinical therapy, for the treatment of endometriosis-associated pain in young women with surgically confirmed endometriosis. The study hypothesizes that cabergoline would inhibit endometriosis-mediated neuroangiogenesis and that after 6 months, subjects randomized to receive cabergoline would demonstrate decreased pain measures, improved functional disability scores, and decreased circulating angiogenic and inflammatory biomarkers compared with subjects randomized to receive NETA.",
      "detailedDescription": "Endometriosis is a chronic illness affecting approximately 49% of adolescents with chronic pelvic pain and 10% of all women of reproductive age. It has multiple clinical manifestations, including dysmenorrhea, acyclic pelvic pain, nausea, dyspareunia, dyschezia, fatigue, and infertility. Current medical treatments center on hormonal manipulation but are often limited by lack of success, high cost, or side effects. Approximately 50% of women with endometriosis experience recurrent symptoms over a 5-year period, irrespective of the treatment approach.\n\nThe development of endometriosis involves interactions between hormonal, immunologic, inflammatory, and proangiogenic processes. Angiogenesis and concomitant neurogenesis play a key role in the ectopic implantation of endometrial tissue, its development into endometriosis, and the development of chronic pain. Angiogenic pathways are stimulated by inflammatory cells and angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α).\n\nDopamine receptor 2 (DRD2) agonists are a theoretical alternative to commercial antiangiogenic agents. In animal models, DRD2 agonists inhibit pathologic angiogenesis in tumors by inactivating VEGF receptor 2 (VEGF-R2) signaling. In contrast to other antiangiogenic agents, this type of medication has an acceptable safety profile and does not interfere with the normal establishment and progression of pregnancy.\n\nThis pilot study was conducted at Boston Children's Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital from 2016 to 2018. Eligible women were aged 15-40 years, were premenopausal, and had surgically confirmed endometriosis determined using laparoscopy within 2 years prior to study baseline. Participants were experiencing pelvic pain over the last month, as determined using a visual analog scale (VAS) score of ≥3. Nine women were randomized into 2 groups: Group 1 received 5 mg of oral NETA daily + placebo tablet twice weekly; Group 2 received oral 0.5 mg of cabergoline twice weekly + placebo tablet daily for 6 months.\n\nThe primary endpoint was the measurement of pain in multiple dimensions, including 4 core chronic pain outcome domains (physical functioning, pain intensity, emotional functioning, and feeling of improvement). Serum samples were obtained for the measurement of inflammation and assessment of the angiogenic pathway, including VEGF, TNF-α, VEGF-R1, IL-8, and other markers. Safety assessments included vital signs, laboratory tests, and adverse event monitoring."
