      "briefSummary": "This qualitative study explores the experiences of individuals with HIV and opioid use disorder (OUD) who were randomized to receive extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) in the CHOICES clinical trial. The study examines both successful and unsuccessful XR-NTX induction experiences through semi-structured interviews to understand barriers and facilitators to treatment initiation. XR-NTX requires complete cessation of opioid use before initiation, which can be challenging as withdrawal symptoms are often severe. This research aims to identify strategies to improve XR-NTX initiation rates in high-need populations.",
      "detailedDescription": "The CHOICES Scale-up study (CTN-0067) examined medication treatments for opioid use disorder in HIV clinics, comparing HIV clinic-based extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) versus treatment-as-usual (buprenorphine or methadone). This nested qualitative study involved semi-structured interviews with 37 participants randomized to XR-NTX across five HIV clinics between 2018 and 2019. Of these, 20 successfully completed XR-NTX induction and 17 did not.\n\nParticipants included 43% women, 62% African Americans, and 16% Hispanics, aged 27 to 69 years. All eligible participants with moderate or severe OUD and HIV viral RNA ≥200 copies/ml who were approached for interviews agreed to participate. Interviews were conducted either face-to-face or by telephone, lasting 20-40 minutes, and covered topics including participant characteristics, HIV care history, substance use history, treatment history, social supports, and views on OUD medications, particularly withdrawal and induction experiences.\n\nUsing thematic analysis within a Constructivist paradigm, three key themes emerged among participants who successfully completed induction: (1) readiness for change, including motivation from family, desire for life improvement, and fatigue with opioid use; (2) supportive environment during withdrawal with access to comfort medications and either inpatient medically supervised withdrawal or supportive home environments; and (3) caring interactions with study staff providing educational, operational, and emotional support.\n\nConversely, four themes emerged among participants unable to complete induction: (1) concern and anxiety about withdrawal based on past negative experiences, including fears about severity of withdrawal symptoms, inability to access inpatient facilities, and perception that transitioning directly from fentanyl or heroin was impossible; (2) ambivalence about stopping opioids, with participants not ready to cease use, valuing opioids for pain management or coping, and prioritizing other life responsibilities; (3) concerns about XR-NTX effects, including negative information received from others, fears of unmanaged pain, continued cravings, overdose risk, or increased stimulant use; and (4) preferences for other medications, particularly when participants had beneficial prior experiences with buprenorphine or methadone.\n\nThe study found that inpatient medically managed withdrawal provided advantages through supportive medications and removal from use environments. Patient preference and motivation significantly influenced treatment initiation success. The findings highlight the need for enhanced strategies including aggressive advance treatment of withdrawal symptoms, patient education about XR-NTX mechanisms and expectations, shared decision-making respecting patient preferences, and improved access to supportive withdrawal management settings."
