      "briefSummary": "This phase II, double-blind, multicenter, randomized, 12-week study evaluated the efficacy and safety of a novel triple-combination fixed-dose topical gel containing clindamycin phosphate 1.2%, benzoyl peroxide 3.1%, and adapalene 0.15% (IDP-126) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne. The study compared IDP-126 to vehicle gel and three component dyad gels (BPO/adapalene, clindamycin/BPO, and clindamycin/adapalene) in participants aged 9 years and older. The hypothesis was that combining an antibiotic, antibacterial, and retinoid in a single formulation would provide greater efficacy and tolerability than single or dyad treatments while potentially improving patient compliance and reducing antibiotic resistance.",
      "detailedDescription": "In this phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled study, 741 participants aged ≥9 years with moderate (EGSS 3) or severe (EGSS 4) acne were enrolled from 31 study centers in the USA and four in Canada. Eligible participants had 30-100 inflammatory lesions (pustules, papules, and nodules), 35-150 noninflammatory lesions (closed and open comedones), and two or fewer nodules. Participants were equally randomized to receive one of five treatments applied to the face once daily for 12 weeks: clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/BPO 3.1%/adapalene 0.15% gel (IDP-126); one of three component dyads (BPO/adapalene, clindamycin/BPO, or clindamycin/adapalene); or vehicle gel. All active dyads were formulated with the same active drug concentrations and within the same vehicle as IDP-126.\n\nCoprimary endpoints were treatment success at week 12 (≥2-grade reduction from baseline in EGSS and clear/almost clear skin) and least-squares mean absolute changes from baseline in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts to week 12. Secondary and post hoc analyses included treatment success and ≥2-grade EGSS reduction by study visit, percent changes in lesion counts, and quality-of-life assessments using the Acne-Specific Quality of Life (Acne-QoL) questionnaire. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events, investigator-assessed cutaneous safety (scaling, erythema, hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation), and participant-reported tolerability (itching, burning, stinging).\n\nIDP-126 is formulated as an aqueous gel with no alcohol, preservatives, occlusive agents, or surfactants. It is pH balanced for the skin and contains propylene glycol as a hydrating humectant. BPO and adapalene are micronized for better penetration of the pilosebaceous unit, and all ingredients are contained within a polymeric gel for even distribution on the skin. The combination targets three of the four acne pathogenic pathways: adapalene normalizes keratinocyte proliferation and has anti-inflammatory properties; BPO provides antibacterial activity with mild comedolytic effects; and clindamycin reduces C. acnes colonization with anti-inflammatory effects. The study aimed to demonstrate that this triple combination would provide superior efficacy to the component dyads while maintaining good tolerability."
