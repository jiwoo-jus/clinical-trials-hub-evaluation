      "briefSummary": "This phase III study evaluated whether replacing taxane plus trastuzumab with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) after anthracycline chemotherapy could improve efficacy and reduce toxicity in patients with high-risk human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive early breast cancer. Both treatment arms included pertuzumab. The study aimed to determine if anthracycline chemotherapy followed by T-DM1 plus pertuzumab (AC-KP) was superior to anthracycline chemotherapy followed by taxane plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab (AC-THP) in terms of invasive disease-free survival.",
      "detailedDescription": "KAITLIN is a randomized, multinational, open-label phase III study conducted in 288 centers across 36 countries. The study enrolled adults with newly diagnosed, HER2-positive, nonmetastatic, histologically confirmed, operable primary invasive breast carcinoma. Eligible patients had either node-positive disease (pN ≥ 1) with any tumor size except T0 and any hormone receptor status, or node-negative disease (pN0) with pathologic tumor size > 2.0 cm and negative for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 within 9 weeks of definitive breast surgery to receive either anthracycline chemotherapy followed by trastuzumab and a taxane plus pertuzumab (AC-THP) or anthracycline chemotherapy followed by T-DM1 plus pertuzumab (AC-KP). The coprimary efficacy endpoints were invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) in the node-positive subpopulation and IDFS in the overall population. Secondary endpoints included IDFS plus second primary nonbreast cancer, disease-free survival, distant recurrence-free interval, and overall survival. Safety assessments included adverse events, cardiac events, and patient-reported outcomes using EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 questionnaires. The study aimed to improve outcomes while reducing chemotherapy-associated toxicity in high-risk HER2-positive early breast cancer."
