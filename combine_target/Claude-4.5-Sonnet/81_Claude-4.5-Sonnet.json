      "briefSummary": "This study examined the relationship between retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) that did not require ophthalmologic intervention and neurodevelopmental and vision outcomes at 2 years corrected age in children born extremely preterm. The hypothesis was that children with ROP stage ≤3 who did not receive ophthalmologic intervention would have worse motor, cognitive, and language skills and more vision abnormalities than children without ROP.",
      "detailedDescription": "This was a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of myo-inositol on ROP in the NICHD Neonatal Research Network. The study included 506 children born at less than 28 weeks' gestation who survived to 22-26 months corrected age. Participants were categorized into three groups: 1) children with no history of ROP (n=173, 34%), 2) children with history of ROP stage ≤3 without ophthalmologic intervention (n=262, 52%), and 3) children with history of ROP with ophthalmologic intervention (n=71, 14%). Ophthalmologic intervention included retinal ablation, scleral buckling, vitrectomy, or anti-VEGF therapy.\n\nPrimary outcomes were Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd Edition (Bayley-III) composite scores for motor, cognitive, and language domains. Secondary outcomes included behavioral difficulties assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), neurological examination findings, cerebral palsy, gross motor function classification, hearing loss, and ophthalmologic measures including strabismus, nystagmus, roving eye movements, ability to track 180 degrees, visual acuity, and need for corrective lenses. Outcomes were compared using adjusted linear or modified Poisson models, adjusting for maternal race, gestational age, sex, and severe intraventricular hemorrhage."
