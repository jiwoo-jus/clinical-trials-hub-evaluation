      "briefSummary": "This 12-week, randomized (1:1:1), double-blind, parallel-group, phase 2a study was designed to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and optimal daily dose of OV101 (gaboxadol) 5 mg administered once daily (QD), twice daily (BID), or three-times daily (TID) for 12 weeks to adolescent and adult men with Fragile X syndrome (FXS). Safety was the primary study objective, with key assessments including treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), treatment-related adverse events leading to study discontinuation, and serious adverse events (SAEs). The secondary study objective was to evaluate the effect of OV101 on a variety of problem behaviors.",
      "detailedDescription": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by a >200-trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Individuals with FXS can present with a range of neurobehavioral impairments including, but not limited to: cognitive, language, and adaptive deficits; autism spectrum disorder (ASD); anxiety; social withdrawal and avoidance; and aggression. Decreased expression of the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor δ subunit and deficient GABAergic tonic inhibition could be associated with symptoms of FXS. Gaboxadol (OV101) is a δ-subunit–selective, extrasynaptic GABAA receptor agonist that enhances GABAergic tonic inhibition. This study enrolled 23 participants with FXS (13 adolescents, 10 adults) with moderate-to-severe neurobehavioral phenotypes (Full Scale Intelligence Quotient, 41.5 ± 3.29; ASD, 82.6%) randomized to OV101 5 mg QD (n=8), 5 mg BID (n=8), or 5 mg TID (n=7) for 12 weeks. Clinic visits were scheduled at weeks 2, 6, and 12 (end of treatment), with an end-of-study follow-up visit between weeks 16 and 18. Safety endpoints included TEAEs, treatment-related adverse events, TEAEs leading to study discontinuation, and SAEs. Efficacy endpoints included Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale score and changes from baseline in CGI-S total and subscale scores, ABC-C total and subscale scores, ABC-CFXS total and subscale scores, ADAMS total and subscale scores, RBS-R total and subscale scores, Short Sensory Profile–2 total and subscale scores, and Conners 3 subscale scores."
