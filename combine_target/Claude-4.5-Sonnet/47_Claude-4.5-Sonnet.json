      "briefSummary": "High rates of restricted community participation have been reported in young children with developmental disabilities. Occupational performance coaching (OPC), grounded in self-determination theory, aims to facilitate children's participation in life situations through coaching parents. However, there have been limited randomized controlled trials demonstrating the efficacy of OPC, especially with a specific focus on children's community participation. The proposed study is the first step in evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial of OPC in Hong Kong and testing its initial efficacy (in comparison to parent consultation) in promoting children's community participation.",
      "detailedDescription": "This is a feasibility and pilot double-blind randomized controlled trial. Fifty children aged 6 years or below with developmental disabilities and their parents will be recruited from early intervention centers and/or through social media in Hong Kong. Parents will be randomly assigned to receive OPC or consultation, and will be blinded to group allocation. Outcomes will be assessed by blinded assessors at baseline, pre-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up. Predetermined success criteria will be used to assess the feasibility of the trial. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with parents to explore the acceptability and perceived impact of OPC.\n\nThe OPC intervention comprises three components defined as the enabling domains: (1) connect–building parents' trust in the coach by using verbal and nonverbal strategies such as listening, empathizing, and partnering; (2) structure–building parents' competence by adopting a problem-solving framework of setting goals, exploring options, planning action, carrying out plans, checking performance, and generalizing; and (3) share–building parents' autonomy by reciprocally exchanging information between the coach and parents with an emphasis on eliciting parents existing knowledge. The OPC intervention will consist of four to eight weekly (or fortnightly) sessions in correspondence with the number of goals identified by parents and the progress of the goal achievement. Each session will last 30 min to 1 h.\n\nParents who are randomized to the control treatment will receive consultation regarding community resources from occupational therapists or occupational therapy students. A toolbox of community resources has been developed by the research team by identifying public playgrounds, play groups, and sports programs sponsored by non-governmental organizations or government. The direct informing approach will be used to instruct parents about the availability of environmental resources close to their living areas and what they can plan to do by using possible supportive strategies. The consultations will be conducted for four to eight weekly/fortnightly sessions depending on the parents' needs, and each session may last 30 min to 1 h.\n\nThis trial will test whether the study protocol and OPC are feasible and acceptable, as well as assess the initial efficacy of OPC to obtain effect size estimates. The results of the trial will inform future preparations for conducting a full-scale efficacy trial of OPC."
