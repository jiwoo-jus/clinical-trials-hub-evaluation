      "briefSummary": "This first-in-human, randomized pilot phase II clinical trial evaluated the combination of dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccines targeting overexpressed, non-mutated tumor blood vessel antigens (TBVA) with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib in HLA-A2+ patients with advanced melanoma. Autologous type-1-polarized dendritic cells (αDC1) were loaded with HLA-A2-presented peptides derived from TBVA (DLK1, EphA2, HBB, NRP1, RGS5, TEM1) and administered intradermally every other week. Patients were randomized to receive oral dasatinib (70 mg twice daily) starting in week 5 (Arm A) or week 1 (Arm B). The trial assessed safety, T cell responses to vaccine peptides, objective clinical response, and exploratory biomarkers in blood, serum, and tumor tissues.",
      "detailedDescription": "Sixteen HLA-A2+ patients with advanced-stage (IIC-IV) cutaneous, mucosal, or uveal melanoma were enrolled, 15 of whom had previously progressed on programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade. Fourteen patients received treatment, and 13 were evaluable for endpoint analyses. Patients received autologous αDC1/peptide vaccines targeting six tumor blood vessel antigens (DLK1, EphA2, HBB, NRP1, RGS5, TEM1) administered intradermally on days 1 and 15 of each monthly cycle. Dasatinib (70 mg twice daily) was initiated in week 5 for Arm A and week 1 for Arm B. The primary endpoint was peripheral blood T cell response to vaccine peptides measured by IFN-γ ELISPOT assay. Secondary endpoints included safety, objective clinical response per RECIST v1.1, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and exploratory analyses of regulatory immune cells, serum biomarkers, tumor transcriptional profiles, TCR repertoire, and tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) formation. Of 13 evaluable patients, 6 developed specific CD8+ T cell responses against ≥3 vaccine peptides with evidence of epitope spreading. All six responders exhibited TCR convergence and had favorable clinical outcomes (4 PR, 2 SD). Arm B patients outperformed Arm A in immune response rate (66.7% vs 28.6%), objective response rate (66.7% vs 0%), overall survival (median 15.45 vs 3.47 months; p=0.0086), and PFS (median 7.87 vs 1.97 months; p=0.063). Female patients had higher response rates compared to males. Tumors from responders showed baseline inflammation, reduced hypoxia/acidosis/glycolysis on-treatment, increased immune infiltration, and TLS neogenesis. The combination was safe with no grade >3 treatment-related adverse events."
